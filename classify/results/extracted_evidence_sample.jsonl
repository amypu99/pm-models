Sanders maintains that the state did not prove that the child’s death was the result of murder, nor did it prove who committed the murder. She argues that because Renode had been charged with the child’s murder, but had yet to be tried, the court allowed the jury to assume that Renode murdered the child. She maintains that this assumption was a failure of proof on the intimidation count and otherwise tainted her ability to receive a fair trial. The intimidation charge did not require the state to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a murder occurred, much less who committed the murder. Had that been the legislature’s intent, it could easily have used the words ‘criminal conviction’ or ‘delinquent adjudication’ rather than ‘criminal or delinquent act.’ The state only had to prove that the victim had knowledge about a fact or facts concerning the child’s death and that Sanders knowingly and by force or threat of harm intimidated the victim because of the victim’s knowledge of facts concerning the matter. As charged in the indictment, the to-wit clause referencing murder applied merely to describe the circumstances of the criminal act; the precise nature of the criminal act was not a separate element of proof for the offense of intimidation. The evidence showed that the victim of the intimidation count, who was 13 years of age at the time, slept at the house where the stabbing occurred. He testified that after family members found the child, he personally saw the child on a bedroom floor, wrapped in a quilt and bleeding (the child had been stabbed in the neck). The child’s mother told the victim to go to a local grocery store and locate her fiancé. The victim found the fiancé with Sanders and Renode. After the victim said that the child ‘was bleeding’ and might be dead, the fiancé and Renode started running to the house, but Sanders only walked, telling the victim that the child was ‘not dead, he’s okay.’ When they returned to the house, Renode went to the bedroom, but Sanders remained outside. The child testified that Renode then came out of the bedroom ‘really quick and said I have to get out of here * * *.’ Trial testimony established that Sanders and Renode had previously stayed at the mother’s house, but were told to move out after ‘a bunch of altercations’ with her children. As she was moving out, Sanders told the mother that ‘I’ll be back and I’m going to kill you and your kids.’ Sanders and Renode returned to the house a few weeks later, claiming that they were homeless and needed a place to stay. The mother took them in as an act of charity. Two days later, the mother became upset after discovering that Renode had given an alcoholic drink to the child. After sending the child to bed, the mother, her fiancé, Sanders, and Renode watched a movie. The mother checked on the child and found him sleeping on the floor, so she told Sanders and Renode that they could sleep in the child’s bed. When the mother checked on the child two hours later, she found the child wrapped in a quilt and bleeding from a stab wound to the neck. Sanders and Renode were no longer in the house. The day after the child’s death, the mother’s fiancé found a pair of blood-soaked pants belonging to Renode in a clothes pile in one of the bedrooms. The child’s mother testified that in the days following the stabbing, Renode’s name was mentioned most frequently in speculation about who killed her son, given that bloody pants belonging to Renode were found in the house. Four days after the stabbing, the victim and his girlfriend were walking down the street where the stabbing occurred. They saw a car driving slowly down the street, with Renode and Sanders in the back seat. Renode, sitting behind the driver, extended a gun out the car window and fired about six times. Two bullets struck a vehicle next to where the victim was standing. The car then sped away. The state offered no expert testimony on the cause of the child’s death, nor did it offer any evidence in the form of police testimony regarding an investigation into the child’s death. Nevertheless, the jury could reasonably infer that the child, having been stabbed in the neck and wrapped in a quilt, died as result of foul play that rose to the level of a criminal act. *Jackson v. Virginia*, 443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979) (it is ‘the responsibility of the trier of fact fairly to resolve conflicts in the testimony, to weigh the evidence, and to draw reasonable inferences from basic facts to ultimate facts’). Evidence that Renode and Sanders may have been involved in the child’s death provided a motive for intimidation. The victim testified that Renode and Sanders both made incriminating statements on the night of the child’s death. And the discovery of Renode’s bloody pants appeared to tie him to the death. These background facts put into perspective the victim’s testimony that the car in which Sanders and Renode were traveling slowly down the street slowed down and that Renode fired multiple shots at him. A rational trier of fact could have found the shooting to be an act to intimidate the victim from testifying in a future criminal proceeding related to the child’s death. *State v. Jenks*, 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492 (1991), paragraph two of the syllabus. The facts support that the shots were intended to injure the victim and/or intimidate him. There is no evidence of any other plausible explanation for the shooting. In addition to the direct evidence of intimidation, the jury could rationally find that Sanders fled the jurisdiction with Renode, an act that showed a consciousness of guilt. *State v. Eaton*, 19 Ohio St.2d 145, 249 N.E.2d 897 (1969), paragraph six of the syllabus (‘Flight from justice * * * may be indicative of a consciousness of guilt.’). Testimony showed that warrants were issued for the arrest of Sanders and Renode just days after the shooting. It is unclear when the two left Ohio, but Renode was forcibly apprehended six months later in Indiana. Although there was no evidence that Sanders fired the shots at the victim, a rational trier of fact could find Sanders complicit in intimidating the victim; that is, that she acted with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense and she aided and abetted Renode. See R.C. 2923.03(A). Aiding and abetting can be inferred by presence, companionship, and conduct before and after the offense is committed. *State v. Johnson*, 93 Ohio St.3d 240, 245, 754 N.E.2d 796 (2001). Evidence that Sanders and Renode were together on the night the child died, along with incriminating statements both she and Renode later made, shows that Sanders would have benefitted just as much as Renode by intimidating the victim. This self-interest and companionship was sufficient evidence from which the jury could infer that Sanders was complicit in committing intimidation.\"\n}\n```"}

He claims that he was unaware of the existence of the exhibits until trial commenced.\\n\\nCrim.R. 16(B) provides: Upon receipt of a written demand for discovery by the defendant * * *, the prosecuting attorney shall provide copies or photographs, or permit counsel for the defendant to copy or photograph, the following items related to the particular case indictment, information, or complaint, and which are material to the preparation of a defense, or are intended for use by the prosecuting attorney as evidence at the trial, or were obtained from or belong to the defendant, within the possession of, or reasonably available to the state, subject to the provisions of this rule: * * * (5) Any evidence favorable to the defendant and material to guilt or punishment[.]\\n\\nTucker acknowledges that he made no written request for discovery in the trial court, but indicates that the state provided initial discovery responses on October 14, 2016. He maintains that the state proceeded as if discovery had been requested. He also claims that the trial court treated this receipt of discovery responses as a tolling event for speedy-trial purposes, but at trial, it “acted as if no request was ever made.” He maintains that “the lower court cannot claim one thing at trial and the exact opposite in a subsequent judgment entry.” The state responds that the trial record makes clear that Tucker made the deliberate decision not to request discovery—despite knowing that the video recording existed—because he did not want to toll the speedy-trial clock. It also argues that Tucker’s argument is barred by res judicata because it could have been raised on direct appeal.\\n\\nThe trial court in its judgment appears to have treated Tucker’s argument concerning the non-disclosure of exhibits as a claim that new evidence had been discovered. It concluded that “the discovery of new evidence of innocence after a defendant has been tried, convicted and sentenced does not constitute a triable post-conviction claim of substantive constitutional magnitude,” however, it noted that it had “considered the argument and sees no merit in it under these facts.”\\n\\nA trial court’s decision to deny a petition for postconviction relief involves mixed questions of law and fact. We review the trial court’s decision on factual issues using a manifest weight standard of review, and we review the trial court’s decision on legal issues de novo.” State v. Neyland, 6th Dist.

No. L-01-1281, 2002-Ohio-5201, ¶ 6.\\n\\nHere, the record here is very clear that Tucker made the deliberate decision not to request discovery. The October 26, 2016 trial transcript contains the following exchange relative to this point: The court: I need to address on the record, that the Court notes that the defense in this case did not request discovery. [Defense counsel], let’s address this issue.\\n\\n[Defense counsel]: Judge, I did not request discovery in this case and I advised the State that I did not. Mr. Tucker was represented at the arraignment by [former counsel] but had indicated at that time to this Court and through [former counsel] to me that he did not want to waive any of his speedy trial rights. * * * And so I explained to him that if I were to request discovery, pursuant to case law and rule, the speedy trial time is tolled based upon a request for discovery and stays tolled until reciprocal discovery is provided. With that understanding, he had agreed that he does not want to waive that speedy trial time, therefore, is in agreement with my not requesting discovery in this case. I explained to him in full that that put us at somewhat of a disadvantage because we are flying a little bit blind. We knew the facts of the case and we had discussed it previously, but there were evidentiary issues that could present themselves that I would not have access to because I had not requested discovery. My client indicated he was comfortable with going forward on that basis.\\n\\nThe court: Mr. Tucker, is that correct?\\n\\nThe defendant: Yes, Your Honor, it is.\\n\\nThe court: And you directed your attorney not to request discovery specifically for that reason?\\n\\nThe defendant: Yes, Your Honor, I did.\\n\\nThe court: So that his failure to request discovery is not any failing on his part to represent you effectively, that is following your direction?\\n\\nThe defendant: That is correct, Your Honor. Yes.\\n\\nThe court: All right.\\n\\n[The state]: * * * I would note that I have a second DVD that was available for inspection, and the DVD surveillance video from the parking lot of Walmart where the defendant allegedly tried to run over J.R.\\n\\nThe court: All right, well this is apparently a tactical decision on the part of the defendant. * * *\\n\\n[Defense counsel]: Judge, I did want to put on the record just for information with regard to the tactical decision to not request discovery, Mr. Tucker and I had discussed tactically the potential for that video that the State talked about – of the parking lot – existing and us not having access to it. So we had discussed that possibility, and even with that understanding, he still was in agreement not to request discovery.\\n\\nThe court: Is that right, Mr. Tucker?\\n\\nThe defendant: Yes, Your Honor, it is.\\n\\nThe record is clear that Tucker made a conscious, tactical decision, not to request discovery and was advised by counsel of the potential consequences of that decision. Accordingly, we find no error in the trial court’s denial of Tucker’s petition for postconviction relief. We also agree with the state that this was an issue that could have been raised on direct appeal, therefore, Tucker is barred by res judicata from raising this issue now. See State v. Henson, 6th Dist. Erie No. E-11-068, 2012-Ohio-3730, ¶ 20 (“Under res judicata a convicted defendant is barred from litigating issues that were raised or could have been raised at trial or on direct appeal from the judgment of conviction.”).\"\n}\n```"}

We disagree.\\n\\nOrdinarily, a trial court is vested with broad discretion in determining the admissibility of evidence in any particular case, so long as such discretion is exercised in line with the rules of procedure and evidence.” *Rigby v. Lake City*, 58 Ohio St.3d 269, 271 (1991). The appellate court must limit its review of the trial court’s admission or exclusion of evidence to whether the trial court abused its discretion. *Id.* The abuse of discretion standard is more than an error of judgment; it implies the court ruled arbitrarily, unreasonably, or unconscionably. *Blakemore v. Blakemore*, 5 Ohio St.3d 217 (1983). Generally, all relevant evidence is admissible. Evid.R. 402.\\n\\nEvid.R. 404(B) provides:\\n(B) Other crimes, wrongs or acts. Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\\n\\nR.C. 2945.59 provides:\\nIn any criminal case in which the defendant’s motive or intent, the absence of mistake or accident on his part, or the defendant’s scheme, plan, or system in doing an act is material, any acts of the defendant which tend to show his motive or intent, the absence of mistake or accident on his part, or the defendant’s scheme, plan, or system in doing the act in question may be proved, whether they are contemporaneous with or prior or subsequent thereto, notwithstanding that such proof may show or tend to show the commission of another crime by the defendant.\\n\\nRule 404(B) of the Ohio Rules of Evidence and R.C. 2945.59 preclude admission of other acts evidence to prove a character trait in order to demonstrate conduct in conformity with that trait. *State v. Williams*, 134 Ohio St.3d 521, 2012-Ohio-5695, 983 N.E.2d 1278, ¶16. There are, however, exceptions to the rule. Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts of an accused tending to show the plan with which an act is done may be admissible for other purposes, such as those listed in Evid.R. 404(B); to show “proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.”\\n\\nIn considering other acts evidence, trial courts should conduct a three-step analysis. The first step is to consider whether the other acts evidence is relevant to making any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more or less probable than it would be without the evidence. Evid.R. 401. Next, the trial court must consider whether evidence of the other crimes, wrongs, or acts is presented to prove the character of the accused in order to show activity in conformity with the character or whether the other acts evidence is presented for a legitimate purpose, such as those stated in Evid.R. 404(B), proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity or absence of mistake or accident. Finally, a trial court is to consider whether the probative value of the other acts evidence is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. See Evid.R. 403, *Williams*, at ¶¶19-20.\\n\\n“Because R.C. 2945.59 and Evid.R. 404(B) codify an exception to the common law with respect to evidence of other acts of wrongdoing, they must be construed against admissibility, and the standard for determining admissibility of such evidence is strict.” *State v. Broom*, 40 Ohio St.3d 277, 281-82, 533 N.E.2d 682 (1988).\\n\\nAs cautioned by the Ohio Supreme Court in *State v. Lowe*, 69 Ohio St.3d 527, 634 N.E.2d 616 (1994), “…we therefore must be careful…to recognize the distinction between evidence which shows that a defendant is the type of person who might commit a particular crime and evidence which shows that a defendant is the person who committed a particular crime.” *Id.* at 530. Evidence to prove the character of person the defendant is to show he acted in conformity therewith is barred by Evid.R. 404(B).\\n\\nWe must first determine whether the other acts evidence is relevant to making any fact of consequence to determination of the action more or less probable than it would be without the evidence. In *Williams*, the Ohio Supreme Court found testimony of prior acts describing grooming techniques were relevant to show the defendant’s intent was sexual gratification. *Williams*, supra, ¶22. Gross Sexual Imposition, with which the defendant was charged, requires “sexual contact.” R.C. 2907.05(A)(1). R.C. 2907.01 defines “sexual contact” to require the touching be for the purpose of “sexual arousing or gratifying either person.” In the instant case, Appellant was charged with both Rape and Gross Sexual Imposition, making intent of sexual gratification an element which the State must prove.\\n\\nThe second step is to consider whether the evidence of the other crimes, wrongs, or acts is presented to prove the character of the accused in order to show conformity therewith, or whether the acts evidence is presented for a legitimate purpose.\\n\\nIn the case *sub judice*, Appellee was permitted to introduce the testimony of another child Appellant raped in similar fashion to that of ZS and AW, raping young female children living in the same home as Appellant when other adults were not around. In its Judgment Entry dated December 19, 2019, the trial court stated, “the sought-after testimony is relevant because it may tend to prove what the prosecution alleges was the defendant’s motive and intent: to derive sexual gratification from groping and raping children.” We find the legitimate purpose of proving Appellant’s intent to derive sexual gratification from groping and raping children relevant for the charge of Gross Sexual Imposition.\\n\\nThe final step is to consider whether the probative value of the other acts evidence is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. In the case sub judice, the trial court gave a limiting instruction before the testimony, after the testimony, and at the close of trial, that the evidence may not be considered as character evidence and that Appellant acted in accordance with any such character trait. In Williams, the Ohio Supreme Court allowed the testimony because:\\nThe evidence is not unduly prejudicial, because the trial court instructed the jury that this evidence could not be considered to show that Williams had acted in conformity with a character trait. This instruction lessened the prejudicial effect of A.B.’s testimony, and A.B. corroborated J.H.’s testimony about the sexual abuse, which had been denied by Williams. Thus Evid.R. 404(B) permitted admission of evidence of William’s prior crime because it helped to prove motive, preparation, and plan on the part of Williams. The prejudicial effect did not substantially outweigh the probative value of that evidence.134 Ohio St.3d 521, ¶24.\\n\\nIn the case sub judice, the trial court instructed the jury that the evidence could not be considered to show that Appellant had acted in conformity with a character trait. The testimony tended to show Appellant’s motive to show sexual gratification for groping and raping children. The prejudicial effect did not outweigh the probative value of that evidence.\\n\\nMoreover, assuming, arguendo, the trial court erred in admitting testimony from LC and EB, we find any error was harmless. Crim.R. 52(A) defines harmless error as “[a]ny error, defect, irregularity, or variance which does not affect substantial rights shall be disregarded.” Before constitutional error can be considered harmless, we must be able to “declare a belief that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.” Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967). Where no reasonable possibility exists that the unlawful testimony contributed to a conviction, the error is harmless and therefore will not be grounds for reversal. State v. Lytle, 48 Ohio St.2d 391, 358 N.E.2d 623 (1976), paragraph three of the syllabus, vacated on other grounds in Lytle v. Ohio, 438 U.S. 910, 98 S.Ct. 3135, 57 L.Ed.2d 1154 (1978).\\n\\nIn the case at bar, there was overwhelming evidence, as set forth above, of Appellant’s guilt. The two victims testified in detail how Appellant raped them when they were little girls, both recounted multiple specific instances and identified Appellant as their abuser. Accordingly, we find any error in admitting the testimony did not have an impact on the verdict, the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, and the other evidence in the case established Appellant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\\n\\nc. Prosecutor’s statements during closing arguments.\\n\\nAppellant argues the prosecutor is arguing Appellant is acting in conformity with a character trait when the prosecutor remarked Appellant is attracted to young girls and is motivated to have sexual relations with them. As Appellant did not object to the remarks during closing arguments, he has waived all but plain error. An error not raised in the trial court must be plain error for an appellate court to reverse. *State v. Long*, 53 Ohio St.2d 91, 372 N.E.2d 804 (1978) at paragraph one of the syllabus; Crim.R. 52(B). To prevail under a plain error analysis, Appellant bears the burden of demonstrating that the outcome of the trial clearly would have been different but for the error. *Id.* at paragraph two of the syllabus. Notice of plain error “is to be taken with the utmost caution, under exceptional circumstances and only to prevent a manifest miscarriage of justice.” *Id.* at paragraph three of the syllabus.\\n\\n“A presumption always exists that the jury has followed the instructions given to it by the trial court.” *Pang v. Minch*, 53 Ohio St.3d 186, 187, 559 N.E.2d 1313 (1990), at paragraph four of the syllabus, *rehearing denied*, 54 Ohio St.3d 716, 562 N.E.2d 163.\\n\\nAs noted above, the trial court instructed the jury that the evidence could not be considered to show that Appellant had acted in conformity with a character trait. Appellant has not demonstrated that “but for” this isolated statement by the prosecutor, he would not have been convicted of the crimes.\\n\\nWe find the trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting evidence of prior acts of child molestation.\\n\\nAppellant’s sole Assignment of Error is overruled.\\n\\nFor the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas, Delaware County, Ohio, is hereby affirmed.\\n\\nBy: Wise, John, J.\\n\\nBaldwin, P. J., concurs.\\n\\nWise, Earle, J., concurs separately\\n\\nJWW/br 0322\\n\\nWise, Earle, J., concurs separately.\\n\\n¶ 42 I concur in the judgment of the majority.\\n\\n¶ 43 While I find error, I find it to be harmless and specifically concur with paragraphs 33 and 34 of the majority opinion.\\n\\n¶ 44 I write separately because I find the other-acts evidence should not have been admitted.\\n\\nThe trial court’s December 19, 2019, judgment entry allowed the other-acts evidence because it found the evidence fit several of the exceptions in Evid.R. 404(B) and R.C. 2945.59.\\n\\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\\n\\nThe Supreme Court of Ohio recently reviewed the admission of other-acts evidence in two cases decided on September 22, 2020; State v. Hartman, 161 Ohio St.3d 214, 2020-Ohio-4440, 161 N.E.3d 651, and State v. Smith, --- Ohio St.3d ---, 2020-Ohio-4441, --- N.E.3d ---. In Hartman at ¶ 19, the court sought to “clear up some of the confusion that exists regarding the use of other-acts evidence.” One issue it made clear was that “the admissibility of other-acts evidence pursuant to Evid.R. 404(B) is a question of law.” Id. at ¶ 22. The question of “whether the evidence is offered for an impermissible purpose does not involve the exercise of discretion” and is subject to review de novo. Id. If a permissible nonpropensity purpose is found, the trial court then has discretion to admit other-acts evidence. Id.\\n\\nPURPOSES FOR WHICH OTHER-ACTS EVIDENCE WERE ADMITTED\\n\\nThe trial court considered whether the evidence supported permissible purposes pursuant to R.C. 2945.59 and Evid.R. 404(B) and found several exceptions. In its judgment entry at page 7, the trial court found:\\n\\nThe factual overlap between the prospective testimonies [of the witnesses] may point to a motive and intent: engaging in the sexual abuse of minors for sexual gratification. Detailed other-acts testimony here may help the jury identify [appellant] by a common scheme, plan, system, or modus operandi – a “behavioral fingerprint” – aimed at the targeting, grooming, and raping of children. The testimony about prior acts of child sex abuse may cast significant doubt, too, on the possibility that any of the alleged conduct in the present matter was accidental. (Citation omitted, emphasis added.)\\n\\nThe trial court further defined the purposes of the other-acts evidence in the instructions it gave to the jury prior to deliberation (T. at 955-956):\\n\\nIf you find that the evidence about other acts on the part of the Defendant is true, then you may consider that evidence only for the purpose of deciding whether that evidence proves: one, the absence of a mistake or an accident on his part on the dates of the crimes at issue in this case; two, his motive or his intent on the dates of the crimes at issue in this case; three, his knowledge of the circumstances surrounding the crimes at issue in this case; or, four, his use of a particular method of selecting, grooming, and sexually abusing minor victims. The evidence about other acts may not be considered by you for any other purpose. (Emphasis added.)\\n\\nANALYSIS OF OTHER-ACTS EVIDENCE\\n\\nThe four nonpropensity reasons for admission of the evidence given by the trial court to the jury will be discussed out of order.\\n\\n1. ABSENCE OF A MISTAKE OR AN ACCIDENT\\n\\nThe trial court first instructed the jury the other-acts evidence may be used to show appellant’s actions were not a mistake nor accidental. Appellant plead not guilty making a general denial of all allegations. He did not testify, nor did the police testify as to statements made by appellant. The record does not reflect any indication he ever claimed mistake or accident. Additionally, the state made no argument that appellant raised a defense claiming the acts were accidental.\\n\\nIn Smith, supra, the Supreme Court of Ohio addressed lack of mistake evidence. In Smith, the defendant was charged in 2016 with rape, gross sexual imposition and disseminating matter harmful to a juvenile. The victim was his granddaughter. The allegations were he rubbed oil on her body under her clothes on her chest, buttock and vagina then licked her breast and vagina. He played a pornographic film showing oral and vaginal intercourse. The next morning he pressed his penis into her backside and began to remove her underwear; she moved away and he stop. He denied any of this was for sexual purposes. He admitted that he rubbed lotion on the child’s body, but any inappropriate touching of private parts was accidental. He claimed that if his penis did touch her it was accidental because he tends to get erections in his sleep. He further claimed an R-rated movie accidentally began to play for a few seconds when he attempted to play a cartoon on a DVD. The state sought to admit other-acts evidence from a 1986 allegation that he did similar things to one of his daughters. The Smith court held the prior testimony was admissible to rebut the defendant’s claim that his 2016 acts were accidental, inadvertent or a mistake.\\n\\nIn the instant case there is no such claim by appellant. In Hartman, supra, the Supreme Court of Ohio at ¶ 27 stated, “it is not enough to say the evidence is relevant to a nonpropensity purpose. The nonpropensity purpose for which the evidence is offered must go to a ‘material’ issue that is actually in dispute....”\\n\\nBecause there is no claim of mistake or accident before the jury, there is nothing for the prosecution to rebut on this issue. I find the evidence may not be admitted for a legitimate purpose under this exception to the rule.\\n\\n3. KNOWLEDGE OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING THE CRIMES\\n\\nThis purpose was not addressed in the trial court’s judgment entry. It is unclear from the record exactly what nonpropensity purpose, “his knowledge of the circumstances surrounding the crimes,” refers to in this case. Typically, this type of other-acts evidence is admitted to show a defendant’s awareness, such as knowledge that he possessed contraband or his awareness of illegal activity. I find under the facts of this case, this is not a permissible purpose to admit other-acts evidence.\\n\\nPURPOSES 2. AND 4.\\n\\nThe next two purposes are the focus of the case as highlighted by the prosecutors’ statements to the jury.\\n\\nIn closing argument, the state told the jury: “So for our purposes, we’re asking that you consider this evidence of other acts on the issues of motive and method. Specifically, his motive and his intent to engage in sexual conduct with minor girls and his method of selecting, grooming, and sexually abusing these minor girls.” T. at 908. Later in rebuttal, the state again argued to the jury how it should use this evidence. “So yes, of course you can consider [L.C.’s] testimony for those purposes that we discussed in our first closing which was to show method and to show motivation that Ron Williams is attracted to underage girls.” T. at 944.\\n\\n4. USE OF A PARTICULAR METHOD OF SELECTING, GROOMING, AND SEXUALLY ABUSING MINOR VICTIMS\\n\\nThe state sought to use the other-acts evidence to show appellant used a particular method of selecting, grooming and abusing his victims. In its judgment entry, the trial court found the other-acts evidence may be helpful to the jury to identify appellant by this common scheme or plan, modus operandi or behavioral fingerprint.\\n\\nThis type of other acts evidence is a permissible purpose if the identity of the actor is an issue in actual dispute. “[Modus operandi] is evidence of signature, fingerprint-like characteristics unique enough ‘to show that the crimes were committed by the same person.’ Evidence of modus operandi is relevant to prove identity.” Hartman, supra, at ¶ 37. (Citations omitted.)\\n\\nIn the instant case there is no question as to who may have done the acts. Both victims were clear the actor was appellant. The only question before the jury was whether the acts occurred. I find the other-acts evidence to prove identity by showing modus operandi or a behavioral fingerprint is not permissible because identity is not in dispute.\\n\\nIn State v. Curry, 43 Ohio St.2d 66, 330 N.E.2d 720 (1975), the Supreme Court of Ohio discussed the two factual situations where the defendant’s scheme, plan or system pursuant to R.C. 2945.59 is relevant. One is identity, which as discussed above is not at issue here. The other, as cited in Curry at 73 is when:\\n\\n[T]he “other acts” form part of the immediate background of the alleged act which forms the foundation of the crime charged in the indictment.\\n\\nTo be admissible pursuant to this sub-category of ‘scheme, plan or system’ evidence, the ‘other acts’ testimony must concern events which are inextricably related to the alleged criminal act. The July 8, 1972, incident and the December 22, 1972, incident are not so related; they are chronologically and factually separate occurrences.\\n\\nThe Hartman court at ¶ 13 cited Curry to re-emphasize the connection of the other-acts evidence to the current crime:\\n\\nCommon-plan evidence generally concerns events that are “inextricably related’ to the crime charged. Curry, 43 Ohio St.2d at 73. The other acts form the “immediate background” of the present crime: they are typically either part of the “same transaction” as the crime for which the defendant is on trial or they are part of “a sequence of events” leading up to the commission of the crime in question.\\n\\nIn Curry there was a five to six-month gap between the charged acts and the other-acts. In our current case there is a at least a seventeen-year gap between the “chronological and factually separate” other-acts and the current charges. I find the other-acts evidence is not admissible pursuant to a common scheme, plan or system exception.\\n\\n2. MOTIVE OR INTENT\\n\\nMotive and intent can be distinct issues. In Hartman at ¶ 48, motive is described as a specific reason for committing a crime. If a person commits a murder to cover up a previous crime, the other-acts evidence of the previous crime may tend to prove the motive for the murder, a permissible nonpropensity purpose. Id. Motive is not typically an element of a criminal offense. Intent is normally an element. Did a person act with the purpose to cause a certain result which culminated in a criminal offense? In the murder example, the motive may be to want a person dead; the intent is the mental purpose to do the act to cause the death (to pull the trigger of a gun). In this case, the trial court and the arguments of the prosecutor appear to treat the terms as one. The evidence was admitted to show appellant’s intent was to derive sexual gratification from the acts alleged in the charge of gross sexual imposition.\\n\\nGenerally, intent is “not a material issue for other-acts purposes unless it is genuinely disputed – in most cases, ‘the act speaks for itself.’ ” Hartman at ¶ 55. However, when the crime charged is one of specific intent, such intent is a material issue in the case. Id. The crime of gross sexual imposition requires the state prove appellant had the specific intent to perform the act(s) for the sexual gratification of himself or another. This is a potential proper purpose for other-acts evidence to be considered. However, based upon the facts of this case, a more thorough examination of the purpose is warranted.\\n\\nThe decision on whether to allow other-acts evidence on the single count of gross sexual imposition should not be considered in a vacuum. Appellant faced sixteen counts of rape as well. The testimony relating to these counts was replete with explicit accounts of sexual conduct that left no question as to appellant’s intent. A single jury heard all of the testimony from both victims. There is certainly an argument, in light of the extensive testimony in the rape counts, that the element of sexual gratification in gross sexual imposition is not in actual dispute.\"\n}\n```"}

When reviewing an argument challenging the weight of the evidence, an appellate court may not substitute its view for that of the trier of fact, but reviews the entire record, weighs the evidence and all reasonable inferences, considers the credibility of witnesses, and determines whether, in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the finder of fact clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered. State v. Thompkins, 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 387, 678 N.E.2d 541 (1997), quoting State v. Martin, 20 Ohio App.3d 172, 175, 485 N.E.2d 717 (1st Dist.1983). Because the trier of fact sees and hears the witnesses at trial, we must defer to the factfinder’s decisions whether, and to what extent, to credit the testimony of particular witnesses. *State v. Lawson*, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 16288, 1997 WL 476684, *4* (Aug. 22, 1997). The fact that the evidence is subject to different interpretations does not render the conviction against the manifest weight of the evidence. *State v. Wilson*, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 22581, 2009-Ohio-525, ¶ 14. A judgment of conviction should be reversed as being against the manifest weight of the evidence only in exceptional circumstances. *Martin* at 175. At trial in August 2019, the State’s evidence at trial established the following facts. On September 17, 2018, Breneman was released from prison and placed on post-release control. Parole Officer Chris Caughman reviewed the conditions of Breneman’s post-release control with Breneman, and Breneman signed the document listing those conditions. One of the conditions was that Breneman must obtain the permission of his parole officer before changing his residence. Breneman reported that he would be residing at the home of his parents (his mother and step-father) in Champaign County. Breneman’s step-father testified that he and his wife had resided at that location since 1981. Parole Officer Patrick Powell was assigned as Breneman’s initial supervising parole officer upon Breneman’s release from prison. Breneman was required to meet with Powell the first and third Thursday of each month, plus have random home visits. Powell testified that Breneman was compliant with his post-release control for the remainder of 2018. Powell had one contact with Breneman in January 2019, and they had no contact in February 2019. Powell testified at trial that he last had contact with Breneman on January 22, 2019. Powell stated that he was concerned about the lack of contact, and he repeatedly went by Breneman’s reported residence (Breneman’s parents’ home), but no one answered the door. Powell also left voicemail messages for Breneman that went unreturned. On March 11, 2019, Parole Officer Brandon Deskins was assigned to be Breneman’s parole officer. Deskins attempted to locate Breneman. On April 3 and 4, Deskins went to Breneman’s parents’ home and left business cards in the front door, asking Breneman to contact him. Breneman’s mother had significant health issues, which required her to take multiple medications, including 7.5-325mg Hydrocodone-Acetaminophen tablets, known as Norco. The parties stipulated that Hydrocodone-Acetaminophen is a Schedule II dangerous drug and is a controlled substance. On April 7, Breneman’s step-father picked up her prescription for a 28-day supply of Norco, which consisted of 112 pills. Breneman’s mother kept her Norco pills on a nightstand in the master bedroom of her home. On April 15 or 16, the bottle of Norco pills went missing. Breneman’s step-father testified that, on April 15, his wife called him into the master bedroom and told him that her pills were missing. He stated that he looked for the Norco bottle, but did not find it. Breneman’s step-father indicated that Breneman and two of Breneman’s children (ages 8 and 12) had come to the house that day. Breneman had stayed for approximately 15 minutes. Breneman’s step-father did not see Breneman take the pills. Breneman’s mother believed that the pills went missing on April 16. She recalled Breneman’s being in the master bedroom of her home and asking her if he could have five of her Norco pills. Breneman’s mother told him that he could not, explaining “My medicine is counted out; only get so many for 28 days.” She left Breneman in the master bathroom, brushing his teeth, while she went into the kitchen. Breneman’s mother testified that the Norco pills were in the master bedroom at that time, and she stated that Breneman left 30 seconds after she went into the kitchen. When she returned to the master bedroom to take a Norco pill, she noticed that the pills were gone, and she called to her husband to tell him the pills were missing. Breneman’s mother also did not see Breneman take the pills, but she believed that he did so. Breneman’s step-father did not know exactly how many pills remained in the bottle on April 15. He thought his wife took four to six pills per day. Breneman’s mother also did not know how many pills she had taken, but she estimated that she had taken six to nine pills over the nine days since April 7. She testified that she did not take 50 or 60 pills. The parties stipulated that 30 or more Norco tablets equals or exceeds the bulk amount. On April 18, Parole Officer Deskins received a call from Breneman’s step-father, who expressed concern that Breneman had stolen his wife’s medication. Deskins asked Breneman’s step-father if they had filed a police report, and the step-father indicated that he had not. Deskins told him to contact the police and file a report if they believed a crime had been committed. Deskins testified that Breneman’s step-father further stated that Breneman had not been living at the residence for approximately two weeks. At one point, Breneman’s step-father testified that Breneman had lived at their home prior to April 15, but he had been asked to leave. In different portions of their testimony, Breneman’s parents testified that Breneman lived at their home on April 15. Parole Officer Deskins declared Breneman to be “whereabouts unknown” and in violation of his post-release control. As a result of that designation, the Adult Parole Authority would wait 30 days and then issue an arrest warrant. Deskins testified that Breneman did not contact him personally or through others. Breneman’s mother contacted the police about the missing pills on April 19, the day after her husband spoke with Deskins. At trial, Breneman’s parents explained the delay, indicating that they had hoped the person who took the pills would return them. Officer Tyler Reasor of the Urbana Police Department responded to Breneman’s parents’ home. They reported to Officer Reasor that their son, Breneman, had stolen more than 100 Norco pills. Officer Reasor was informed that only Breneman’s parents and Breneman had been in the house. Officer Reasor attempted to locate Breneman, but was unable to find him. Officer Reasor spoke with Parole Officer Deskins in an attempt to locate Breneman, but Deskins said that he did not know where Breneman was either. In May 2019, Sheila Sanders had a 1995 Toyota Corolla that was titled in her name. Sanders had gotten the vehicle from her sister in January 2019, and had agreed to sell the vehicle to her (Sanders’s) daughter, Lora Smith, for $400. Sanders testified that Smith had fully paid for the vehicle, but the transfer of title was contingent on Smith’s obtaining a valid driver’s license; Smith had not yet obtained one. Smith testified that she considered herself the owner of the Corolla after the last payment was made in March 2019, and that she bought the car for both herself and Breneman, whom she was then dating. Smith testified that she was arrested on March 28, and Breneman had the keys to the Corolla then. She indicated that Breneman was supposed to return the keys to her mother. On May 6, 2019, Sheila Sanders let Breneman borrow the Corolla. Sanders testified that Breneman told her that he wanted to go to Springfield and would bring the car back that night, in a couple hours. Breneman never returned the car. Sanders tried to contact Breneman, but he had left his phone at her home and she was unable to reach him. Sanders and Smith both testified that they spoke about the car, and Smith told Sanders to report the car as stolen. On May 14, a friend of Sanders spotted the Corolla at a gas station, and Sanders contacted the police. On May 14, 2019, Deputy Jayde Sheeley of the Champaign County Sheriff’s Office responded to call from Sheila Sanders, reporting her vehicle missing. Detective Glenn Kemp later reviewed Sheeley’s report and confirmed with Sanders that the vehicle had not been recovered. Kemp also checked with dispatch and learned that the vehicle had been entered into LEADS as stolen. The vehicle was later recovered in the possession of Suluki Evans. Evans testified that Breneman sold him the Corolla for $500 (Evans said that he still owed $200), and that Breneman led him to believe that he (Breneman) had title to the vehicle. After the 30-day period with Breneman listed as “whereabouts unknown” had passed, the Ohio State Highway Patrol issued a warrant for Breneman’s arrest. On May 20, 2019, Officer Seth Dale, a police officer for Wittenberg University, approached Breneman and another individual after seeing them attempt to open a door to a closed building. After checking with dispatch, Officer Dale learned that Breneman had an arrest warrant for a parole violation. Breneman attempted to flee but was quickly apprehended and taken to jail. On May 21, Parole Officer Deskins learned of Breneman’s arrest and interviewed Breneman at the jail about the alleged theft of medication, car theft, and absconding. Breneman denied taking medication from his mother. He told Deskins, “She doesn’t get nothing.” As for the car, Breneman stated that he had borrowed the car many times and it had never been a problem. Breneman told Deskins, “I paid for that car.” Breneman claimed to have returned the car within the next day or two, and he denied knowing where the car was located. When asked about absconding, Breneman told Deskins that he had been living in Springfield on and off at different people’s residences, and mentioned two women. Breneman said that his parents’ home was still his residence, but he was not staying there. Breneman explained that he did not report as required, because “I knew you guys were going to arrest me. I think Patrick Powell was going to arrest me.” After deliberations, the jury found Breneman guilty of the five charged offenses: theft of drugs, aggravated possession of drugs, escape, grand theft of a motor vehicle, and receiving stolen property. With respect to the theft of drugs charge (Count 1), the jury further found that the offense involved a dangerous drug and that Breneman previously was convicted of a felony drug abuse offense. As to the aggravated possession of drugs charge (Count 2), the jury further found that the amount of drug involved was equal to or in excess of the bulk amount. Breneman did not present any witnesses. Rather, through cross-examination, he raised whether his mother, who managed her use of Norco, was often confused and may have misplaced the prescription bottle. Defense counsel also raised that Breneman’s two children could have been present when the Norco pills went missing. Counsel emphasized that Breneman’s mother was unsure of how many pills she had taken from the bottle and how many were left. In reaching its verdict, the jury was free to believe all, part, or none of the testimony of each witness and to draw reasonable inferences from the evidence presented. State v. Baker, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 25828, 2014-Ohio-3163, ¶ 28. It was the province of the jury, as the trier of fact, to weigh the evidence and determine whether the State had proven, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Breneman committed each of the charged offenses. Upon review of the testimony of both of Breneman’s parents, the jury could have reasonably concluded that, on or about April 15, Breneman’s mother had her prescription Norco pills on her nightstand, that Breneman stole the pills from the master bedroom, that the amount remaining in the bottle equaled or exceeded the bulk amount, and that the Norco pills were a Schedule II dangerous drug and a controlled substance. The fact that no one observed Breneman take his mother’s Norco medication did not require a different conclusion. Breneman stipulated that he had a prior felony drug abuse offense conviction. The jury’s guilty verdicts as to theft of drugs and aggravated possession of drugs were not against the manifest weight of the evidence.\"\n}\n```"}

At trial in August 2019, the State’s evidence at trial established the following facts. On September 17, 2018, Breneman was released from prison and placed on post-release control. Parole Officer Chris Caughman reviewed the conditions of Breneman’s post-release control with Breneman, and Breneman signed the document listing those conditions. One of the conditions was that Breneman must obtain the permission of his parole officer before changing his residence. Breneman reported that he would be residing at the home of his parents (his mother and step-father) in Champaign County. Breneman’s step-father testified that he and his wife had resided at that location since 1981. Parole Officer Patrick Powell was assigned as Breneman’s initial supervising parole officer upon Breneman’s release from prison. Breneman was required to meet with Powell the first and third Thursday of each month, plus have random home visits. Powell testified that Breneman was compliant with his post-release control for the remainder of 2018. Powell had one contact with Breneman in January 2019, and they had no contact in February 2019. Powell testified at trial that he last had contact with Breneman on January 22, 2019. Powell stated that he was concerned about the lack of contact, and he repeatedly went by Breneman’s reported residence (Breneman’s parents’ home), but no one answered the door. Powell also left voicemail messages for Breneman that went unreturned. On March 11, 2019, Parole Officer Brandon Deskins was assigned to be Breneman’s parole officer. Deskins attempted to locate Breneman. On April 3 and 4, Deskins went to Breneman’s parents’ home and left business cards in the front door, asking Breneman to contact him. Breneman’s mother had significant health issues, which required her to take multiple medications, including 7.5-325mg Hydrocodone-Acetaminophen tablets, known as Norco. The parties stipulated that Hydrocodone-Acetaminophen is a Schedule II dangerous drug and is a controlled substance. On April 7, Breneman’s step-father picked up her prescription for a 28-day supply of Norco, which consisted of 112 pills. Breneman’s mother kept her Norco pills on a nightstand in the master bedroom of her home. On April 15 or 16, the bottle of Norco pills went missing. Breneman’s step-father testified that, on April 15, his wife called him into the master bedroom and told him that her pills were missing. He stated that he looked for the Norco bottle, but did not find it. Breneman’s step-father indicated that Breneman and two of Breneman’s children (ages 8 and 12) had come to the house that day. Breneman had stayed for approximately 15 minutes. Breneman’s step-father did not see Breneman take the pills. Breneman’s mother believed that the pills went missing on April 16. She recalled Breneman’s being in the master bedroom of her home and asking her if he could have five of her Norco pills. Breneman’s mother told him that he could not, explaining “My medicine is counted out; only get so many for 28 days.” She left Breneman in the master bathroom, brushing his teeth, while she went into the kitchen. Breneman’s mother testified that the Norco pills were in the master bedroom at that time, and she stated that Breneman left 30 seconds after she went into the kitchen. When she returned to the master bedroom to take a Norco pill, she noticed that the pills were gone, and she called to her husband to tell him the pills were missing. Breneman’s mother also did not see Breneman take the pills, but she believed that he did so. Breneman’s step-father did not know exactly how many pills remained in the bottle on April 15. He thought his wife took four to six pills per day. Breneman’s mother also did not know how many pills she had taken, but she estimated that she had taken six to nine pills over the nine days since April 7. She testified that she did not take 50 or 60 pills. The parties stipulated that 30 or more Norco tablets equals or exceeds the bulk amount. On April 18, Parole Officer Deskins received a call from Breneman’s step-father, who expressed concern that Breneman had stolen his wife’s medication. Deskins asked Breneman’s step-father if they had filed a police report, and the step-father indicated that he had not. Deskins told him to contact the police and file a report if they believed a crime had been committed. Deskins testified that Breneman’s step-father further stated that Breneman had not been living at the residence for approximately two weeks. At one point, Breneman’s step-father testified that Breneman had lived at their home prior to April 15, but he had been asked to leave. In different portions of their testimony, Breneman’s parents testified that Breneman lived at their home on April 15. Parole Officer Deskins declared Breneman to be “whereabouts unknown” and in violation of his post-release control. As a result of that designation, the Adult Parole Authority would wait 30 days and then issue an arrest warrant. Deskins testified that Breneman did not contact him personally or through others. Breneman’s mother contacted the police about the missing pills on April 19, the day after her husband spoke with Deskins. At trial, Breneman’s parents explained the delay, indicating that they had hoped the person who took the pills would return them. Officer Tyler Reasor of the Urbana Police Department responded to Breneman’s parents’ home. They reported to Officer Reasor that their son, Breneman, had stolen more than 100 Norco pills. Officer Reasor was informed that only Breneman’s parents and Breneman had been in the house. Officer Reasor attempted to locate Breneman, but was unable to find him. Officer Reasor spoke with Parole Officer Deskins in an attempt to locate Breneman, but Deskins said that he did not know where Breneman was either.

The probative value of conducting an experiment with soft wood as a substitute for the human body is not immediately apparent. To allow Kapelsohn to testify regarding the results of such an experiment on redirect, when the State was unaware of either the methodology or the results of the experiment would have been unfair to the prosecution. The case of State v. Branham, 104 Ohio App.3d 355, 662 N.E.2d 54 (12th Dist.1995), is comparable. In Branham, defense counsel had identified an expert witness in the pretrial discovery statement but did not disclose the details of an experiment involving the shooting of arrows into a pig skull stuffed with styrofoam.

{"Index": "079-JARRELL", "allegation_num": "allegation_1", "allegation": "The trial court erred by prohibiting testimony and evidence relating to Battered Child Syndrome and/or PTSD as said evidence was admissible pursuant to the Ohio Supreme Court's decision in State v. Nemeth.", "discussion": "```json\n{\n  \"discussion\": \"Appellant contends that the trial court abused its discretion by excluding Dr. McPherson’s report and her potential testimony, which was relevant to his argument regarding voluntary manslaughter. As the evidence was intended to demonstrate a history of child abuse that triggered Appellant’s sudden passion and fit of rage, he argues this evidence is admissible pursuant to Nemeth. The evidence was also necessary to respond to the state’s repeated commentary on his lack of corroboration regarding his allegations of sexual abuse. The state responds that Dr. McPherson did not diagnose Appellant with battered child syndrome, thus her report and the potential testimony of Appellant’s mother and sister are irrelevant. The state also argues that Appellant did not testify that he acted under a sudden passion or a fit of rage. Even so, the state points out that words are generally insufficient to support a voluntary manslaughter claim. There are four separate evidentiary issues within this assignment of error, including the admissibility of: (1) evidence pertaining to sexual abuse involving T.J., (2) evidence pertaining to sexual abuse involving a childhood acquaintance, (3) evidence of a head injury Appellant suffered as a child, and (4) testimony from Appellant’s mother and sister pertaining to the abuse inflicted by T.J. While each argument is related, a distinct analysis of each is required. Appellant was diagnosed with PTSD. According to Dr. McPherson’s report, her diagnosis was based on an interview with Appellant, psychological testing, ancillary information, and an interview with Appellant’s sister. Appellant’s sister spoke to Dr. McPherson about an incident where she observed Appellant and T.J. engaging in inappropriate behavior. The report detailed the alleged sexual abuse of Appellant by T.J. and was consistent with Appellant’s testimony; however, the report provided a more in-depth look at the abuse. The report also addressed abuse Appellant suffered from a childhood acquaintance and a head injury he suffered as a child. These latter two incidents are limited to a few lines in the report. According to the report, Appellant’s coping mechanism involves a high level of emotional reactivity due to the extent of his trauma. The report also noted that Appellant has an issue with male sexuality due to T.J. subjecting him to male partners at a young age. Dr. McPherson found that Appellant’s description of the abuse was consistent with her test results. Based on the testing, Dr. McPherson diagnosed Appellant with major depressive disorder, PTSD as a result of multiple sexual abuse experiences, and substance abuse and dependance. Dr. McPherson opined that the abuse perpetrated by T.J. is considered extreme based on Appellant’s repeated victimization. Child Abuse - T.J. The leading case regarding child abuse that results in the killing of the abuser is Nemeth. In Nemeth, the defendant’s mother violently physically abused him for several years. Id. at 202. On the date of the incident, the defendant’s mother was abusive and, believing his life was in danger, he killed her. The defense sought to introduce a report diagnosing him with PTSD/battered child syndrome for purpose of establishing a self-defense claim and as a justification for a lesser included offense to murder. Id. at 204. At oral argument in the instant case, the state suggested that Nemeth is limited to cases involving violent abuse and does not apply to cases involving sexual abuse. Contrary to the state’s claim, there is no support for the argument that Nemeth is limited to violent abuse, alone. Nemeth clearly articulates a general rule that expert testimony is admissible if it is relevant. While it is true that Nemeth involved violent abuse, nothing within the opinion limits its application to that type of abuse. In fact, the oral arguments in Nemeth relied on a case involving sexual abuse and this is discussed in Nemeth. Nemeth, 82 Ohio St.3d at 207, 694 N.E.2d 1332 (1998), citing State v. Stowers, 81 Ohio St.3d 260, 690 N.E.2d 881 (1998); Nemeth at fn. 1, citing Stowers, supra. While Stowers did not involve the death of the abuser, it did involve the admissibility of expert testimony on the issue of whether a violently abused child fits the general characteristics observed in sexually abused children. Id. at 262. The Nemeth Court applied Stowers’ guiding principles and determined that “[g]eneral information on battered child syndrome would also tend to show that [the defendant’s] behavior was consistent with that of an abused child and would lend support to his testimony that he had been abused both generally and just prior to the killing.” Nemeth at 207, citing Stowers, at 262. If the Nemeth Court found it appropriate to rely on Stowers, then it stands to reason that Nemeth is applicable to sexual abuse cases where expert testimony is offered by the defense. Notably, Nemeth has been applied to several other cases involving sexual abuse. See State v. Butts, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 108381, 2020-Ohio-1498; State v. Slaven, 5th Dist. Delaware No. 12 CAA 08 0062, 2013-Ohio-3552; State v. Jennings, 10th Dist. Franklin 2001 WL 1045490 (Sept. 13, 2001). Although none of these cases involved the death of the abuser, their reliance on Nemeth furthers the proposition that this case is not limited to physically violent child abuse claims, but stands for the proposition that if expert testimony is relevant and satisfies Evid.R. 702, it is admissible. Significantly, the Nemeth Court specifically stated that: The defense in this case did not ask that battered child syndrome be recognized as a new defense or an independent justification for the killing of an abusive parent. The proffer made at trial was limited to expert testimony that would explain the psychological effects of long-term child abuse, and was proffered in support of a self-defense theory as well as a charge on voluntary manslaughter. As such, the issue before us is an evidentiary matter and is governed by the Ohio Rules of Evidence. Because there was no basis for excluding the testimony under the Rules of Evidence, and because we find that the trial court's exclusion of this testimony to be prejudicial to the defendant, we need not reach the constitutional issues addressed by the court of appeals. Id. at 206-207. We note that the state relies on State v. Hamad, 11th Dist. Trumbull No. 2017-T-0108, 2019-Ohio-2664, appeal not allowed, 157 Ohio St.3d 1466, 2019-Ohio-4419, 133 N.E.3d 537. However, Hamad is readily distinguishable from the instant case. In Hamad, the record demonstrated that “there [was] no history of physical abuse between the victims.” Id. at ¶ 98. The record also showed that “[u]ntil the assault and shooting took place on February 25, only verbal threats and harassing behavior had been exchanged” between the defendant and victim. Id. In the instant case, there was an attempt to present evidence of a lengthy history of sexual abuse that appears to span more than two decades. Hamad did not involve either violent physical or sexual abuse. Instead, it involved “an exchange of offensive communications” that led to a physical confrontation. Id. at ¶ 2. The state also argues that Nemeth does not apply because Dr. McPherson diagnosed Appellant with PTSD, not battered child syndrome. This argument ignores the plain language of Nemeth, which explained that battered child syndrome has many labels, including PTSD. The Nemeth Court noted that the psychological effects and behavioral symptoms have long been recognized by the medical and legal professions regardless of which term is used. *Id.* at 206. In the trial court’s decision to grant the state’s motion in this case, the court referenced *Nemeth* but relied on *State v. Fulmer*, 117 Ohio St.3d 319, 2008-Ohio-936, 883 N.E.2d 1052; *State v. Wilcox*, 70 Ohio St.2d 182, 436 N.E.2d 523 (1982); and *State v. Jackson*, 32 Ohio St.2d 203, 291 N.E.2d 432 (1972). In *Fulmer*, the defendant produced expert testimony that he acted under the influence of an aspirin overdose at the time of the incident. The defense attempted to use the evidence to show that he was “metabolically deranged.” *Id.* at ¶ 64. The Court determined that the evidence was relevant to whether the defendant was capable of forming the requisite intent to commit the crime at issue. *Id.* As such, the Court determined the defense was the functional equivalent of a diminished capacity defense, which is not recognized within Ohio. *Id.* at ¶ 69. In *Wilcox*, the defendant attempted to introduce evidence to show that he was “borderline retarded, schizophrenic, dyslexic, and to be suffering from organic brain syndrome.” *Wilcox*, 70 Ohio St.2d at 182, 436 N.E.2d 523 (1982). The Court held that “a defendant may not offer expert psychiatric testimony, unrelated to the insanity defense, to show that the defendant lacked the mental capacity to form the specific mental state required for a particular crime or degree of crime.” *Id.* at 199. In *Jackson*, the defendant similarly attempted to introduce evidence that he was suffering from a mental disease or defect which so impaired his reason at the time of the criminal act that he did not act knowingly. *Id.* at 205-206. In a limited analysis, the Court explained that in order to attack intent based on capacity, a defendant must show that he was either too intoxicated to form intent (a state of unconsciousness) or have such “defect of reason as not to know the nature and quality of the illegal act or that it is wrong (insane).” *Id.* at 206. We note that *Fulmer* was decided after *Nemeth* but does not cite to *Nemeth*. This is because the two cases address wholly separate issues. *Fulmer*, along with *Jackson* and *Wilcox*, address evidence of an impaired mental state which is intended to show that the defendant did not act knowingly, whereas *Nemeth* addresses evidence of an abusive relationship between the victim and defendant in order to support either a self-defense instruction or voluntary manslaughter charge. As the evidence in this case was sought in an attempt to show that the history of abuse caused Appellant to become enraged and act with sudden passion, and not to argue that he was so impaired he lacked the ability to understand the nature of his actions, *Nemeth* and not *Fulmer, Jackson*, and *Wilcox*, applies. In accordance with *Nemeth*, such evidence is admissible so long as it is relevant and meets the criteria of Evid.R. 702. *Id.* at 207. Pursuant to Evid.R. 401: “‘Relevant evidence’ means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.” The state contends that the evidence is irrelevant, relying on *State v. Sallie*, 81 Ohio St.3d 673, 693 N.E.2d 267 (1998). However, *Sallie* is also readily distinguishable from the instant matter. The issue before the *Sallie* Court was whether trial counsel provided ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to argue that the defendant suffered from battered woman’s syndrome. At trial, however, the defendant did not claim self-defense. Rather, she claimed the shooting was an accident. As the defendant claimed the shooting was accidental, and not a conscious act of self-defense, the Court concluded that any evidence regarding battered woman’s syndrome was irrelevant. *Id.* at 676. The *Nemeth* Court held that evidence of child abuse is relevant to the determination of whether the accused “had acted with prior calculation and design as charged in the indictment, (2) had acted with purpose as required for the lesser included offense of murder, (3) had created the confrontation or initiated the confrontation or initiated the aggression, and (4) had an honest belief that he was in imminent danger.” *Id.* at 207. Relevant to the instant matter, the *Nemeth* Court also explained that Expert testimony on battered child syndrome would, in this case, tend to enhance the probability that [the defendant’s] account of the facts leading up to the killing was truthful and would lend credibility to his assertion that he was in a state of rage and dissociation at the time of the killing. A diagnosis of battered child syndrome and an explanation of its effects would therefore be relevant in determining whether the case warranted a jury charge on voluntary manslaughter. *Id.* at 207-208. At the outset, it is important to consider the *Nemeth* court’s explanation that “[t]he triggering event for posttraumatic stress disorder can be any traumatic event that involved ‘actual or threatened death or serious injury, or a threat to the physical integrity of self or others’ and where the person’s response involved ‘intense fear, helplessness, or horror.” *Id.* at 212. The Court explained that these responses are triggered by an “interpersonal stressor” that can manifest itself in “fear and anxiety, abnormal expressions of aggression or impaired impulse control, reenacting or physiologically reexperiencing the abuse, avoidance (often in the form of hypervigilance), helplessness, somatic complaints, and various forms of dissociation.” *Id.* at 213. As in *Nemeth*, Appellant argues that Dr. McPherson’s report and testimony was relevant to lend credence to his account of the facts leading up to the killing and to provide credibility for his assertion that he was in a state of rage at the time of the incident, both of which are aspects of his voluntary manslaughter argument. He also contends that the evidence is admissible to rebut the state’s repeated comments that he could not corroborate his abuse claims, and to dispel any misconceptions the jurors may have had as to why he did not previously inform anyone of the abuse. We begin our review of Appellant’s voluntary manslaughter argument by noting that the trial court did instruct the jury on voluntary manslaughter. Thus, the trial court implicitly found that Appellant’s testimony, limited as it was, provided a sufficient basis to warrant a voluntary manslaughter instruction. However, contrary to the state’s contentions, we cannot limit our analysis of Appellant’s voluntary manslaughter argument to his testimony, alone. This is because the question before us is whether Dr. McPherson’s report and testimony would have made a voluntary manslaughter conviction more or less probable. Thus, in determining whether that evidence is relevant, we must also consider the extent of what Dr. McPherson’s report and potential testimony would have added to Appellant’s testimony. In beginning our review of Appellant’s testimony, we first address the state’s assertion that a defendant must specifically state legal “buzzwords” such as “sudden passion” and “fit of rage” within their testimony. This assertion is incorrect. Unlike attorneys, lay members of society tend to lack the legal knowledge and sophistication to articulate these terms. Even without using those specific terms, a defendant can sufficiently demonstrate the concepts by describing emotions, actions, or reactions that emulate this standard. Here, Appellant did not explicitly use the phrases “sudden passion” or “fit of rage” during his testimony. Thus, we review his testimony to determine whether the substance of that testimony established facts that would show “sudden passion” and “a fit of rage.” According to Appellant, T.J. became physical with him, throwing things at him and charging at him with a glass snow globe in her hand. Prior to that, she made sexual advances towards him while becoming verbally abusive. The state discounts the language used by T.J. by arguing that words alone are insufficient to establish sudden passion. While the state is generally correct, this is the point where the expert report and testimony of Dr. McPherson become essential to Appellant’s claims. It is Dr. McPherson’s report that links the decades of sexual abuse and sexual confusion to the import these words and actions had on Appellant’s behavior. For instance, Dr. McPherson’s report states that T.J. used the sexual abuse to “toy” with Appellant. Applied to the events leading up to the killing, T.J placed Appellant’s hand on her crotch, pushed her chest against him and questioned his love for her. Her actions in making sexual advances while questioning his love for her could be construed as “toying” with his emotions. Thus, what is important here are not just the words themselves but also the history of the abuse combined with the sexual advancements and the effect that combination had on Appellant’s emotional state. During the altercation, T.J. questioned Appellant’s sexuality by calling him a “faggot” and telling him he did not know how to be a man. Again, in order to understand the significance of this, Appellant cites to the report where Dr. McPherson opines that T.J. caused sexual confusion in Appellant by subjecting him to male sexual partners at a young age. In other words, Dr. McPherson links the decade of T.J.’s abuse to Appellant’s reaction to T.J.’s words, sexual advances, and physical outburst and explains how this combination could have triggered Appellant, causing him to react in the way that he did, resulting in T.J.’s death. During cross examination, the state responded to Appellant’s description of T.J.’s verbal abuse by asking, “[h]ave you heard of sticks and stones?” (Trial Tr., p. 704.) Appellant responded, “[m]a’am, she is hitting me. With all of her past history, my emotional state at the time --.” (Trial Tr., p. 704.) Before Appellant could finish his sentence, the trial court sustained an objection by the state. It is unclear why the trial court sustained the objection. However, from this limited excerpt it is clear Appellant tried to explain his emotions and why T.J.’s words and actions caused him to react in the manner he did, but he was not permitted to provide that testimony. As discussed at length in Nemeth, testimony of an abusive relationship between the victim and defendant is relevant to demonstrate the “triggering event” of PTSD. The event need not rise to the level of threat of death or serious injury but can be “a threat to the physical integrity of self or others.” Id. at 212. The Court explained that this triggering event is relevant to behavior such as “abnormal expressions of aggression or impaired impulse control” and various forms of dissociation. *Id.* at 213. We note that in Dr. McPherson’s report she determined that Appellant’s coping mechanism involved a high level of emotional reactivity. The state also repeatedly confronted Appellant with the lack of corroboration of Appellant’s testimony that he was abused by T.J. For instance, the state commented: “[s]o what is [Appellant] going to do? He is going to attack the only person that can contradict his story, the woman he killed. He is going to blame her for his behavior. He is going to tell you through no corroboration that they were having an affair * * *.” (Trial Tr., pp. 778-779.) The prosecution said it was “convenient” that Appellant never filed a police report regarding his abuse nor had any witnesses to corroborate the abuse. (Trial Tr., p., 713.) Again, we note that Appellant’s corroborating witnesses in this regard were not permitted to testify. The state also questioned why none of the witnesses knew of the abuse, despite the fact that the state was aware of the conclusions in Dr. McPherson’s report and that Appellant was prevented from having other witnesses testify. The *Nemeth* Court emphasized that evidence of battered child syndrome is particularly relevant to dispel a juror’s misconception that if abuse had occurred, the victim would have told someone or filed a police report. The Court explained that “[i]t is the lack of corroborating evidence that makes expert testimony even more crucial in these cases. The defense needs expert testimony to refute the seemingly logical conclusion that serious abuse could not be taking place if no one outside the home was aware of it.” *Id.* at 209. In addressing this issue, the case relies on *State v. Gray*, 2nd Dist. Montgomery No. 26473, 2016-Ohio-5869. *Gray* involved a murder committed by a person who had allegedly suffered sexual abuse earlier in his life. Importantly, the appellant’s victim was not his abuser. The appellant attempted to claim that he killed the victim because he had been abused by someone else, that this abuse caused him to have a violent reaction sufficient to excuse his killing of the victim. The expert report and testimony that was offered concluded that “that the defendant's abnormal mental condition shows that the defendant did not have the specific mental state required for the crime, though he was aware that his action was wrong and was able to control it.” *Id.*, at ¶ 27. The Second District held that the evidence appellant offered: [Did] not fit the rationale given for the exceptions in battered-syndrome cases. Whatever problems [the defendant] has, they are not the result of abuse by [the victim]. Also, [the defendant] does not mention any common misconceptions that [the doctor’s] testimony would dispel. He argues only that her testimony would help the jury understand why the events of his childhood might explain his extreme response to the alleged threat posed by [the victim]. *Id.* at ¶ 32. In other words, the evidence did not show that the defendant suffered “from battered-woman syndrome or battered-child syndrome as a result of abuse at the hands of the ‘victim.’ ” *Id.* at ¶ 31. Instead, he attempted to rely on prior abuse by someone other than the victim to explain why he killed the victim. *Gray* does appear to be an example of a “diminished capacity” case, and as earlier discussed, this theory does not exist in Ohio as a defense. Thus, Gray is clearly distinguishable from the instant matter even though both cases involve sexual abuse. In summation, the admissibility of evidence concerning any kind of abuse is governed by Nemeth. Admission of the evidence in the instant matter was solely sought to explain the psychological effects of the long-term sexual abuse in order to justify and support voluntary manslaughter. The evidence was also relevant to rebut the state’s repeated insistence that Appellant could not corroborate his abuse and the inference that he was lying about the abuse. As the evidence is relevant, the issue becomes whether it is admissible under Evid.R. 702. Pursuant to Evid.R. 702, a witness may testify as an expert if all of the following apply: (A) The witness' testimony either relates to matters beyond the knowledge or experience possessed by lay persons or dispels a misconception common among lay persons; (B) The witness is qualified as an expert by specialized knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education regarding the subject matter of the testimony; (C) The witness' testimony is based on reliable scientific, technical, or other specialized information.* * * As addressed by the Nemeth Court, evidence of battered child syndrome is necessary to assist the jury where there is a lack of corroborating evidence “as a trier of fact is likely to believe that the abuse allegations are fabricated in response to the charges levied against the child-defendant.” *Id.* at 209. Additionally, the Court explained that the evidence assists in helping the jury to understand the effects of the abuse as “[p]rolonged exposure to abuse results in feelings of powerlessness, embarrassment, fear of reprisal, isolation, and low self-esteem.” *Id.* at 208. The same rationale applies to those charged as an adult. *Id.* at 209, citing *Koss, supra.* Dr. McPherson’s report and testimony fall squarely into this category. As to the second prong of Evid.R. 702, the record does not reflect that the state objected to or otherwise questioned Dr. McPherson’s qualifications. Hence, we may infer that the witness satisfied the second prong of the test. As to the third prong, the *Nemeth* Court held that “the behavioral and psychological effects of prolonged child abuse on the child have been generally accepted in the medical and psychiatric communities and therefore unquestionably meet the requisite level of reliability for admission as the subject of expert testimony.” *Id.* at 212. Thus, the evidence is based on scientific information. As to prejudice, the *Nemeth* Court set forth two reasons for their holding: “[b]ecause there was no basis for excluding the testimony under the Rules of Evidence, and because we find that the trial court’s exclusion of this testimony to be prejudicial to the defendant * * *.” *Id.* at 207. It appears axiomatic that a defendant will be prejudiced by the exclusion of otherwise relevant, partially exculpable evidence. To the extent that prejudice must be shown, this jury did not find Appellant guilty of the most serious offenses with which he was charged, aggravated murder and aggravated robbery. Based on the jury’s failure to find Appellant guilty of these two offenses, it can be inferred that jury believed Appellant’s testimony at least in part.

As the evidence was intended to demonstrate a history of child abuse that triggered Appellant’s sudden passion and fit of rage, he argues this evidence is admissible pursuant to Nemeth. The evidence was also necessary to respond to the state’s repeated commentary on his lack of corroboration regarding his allegations of sexual abuse. The state responds that Dr. McPherson did not diagnose Appellant with battered child syndrome, thus her report and the potential testimony of Appellant’s mother and sister are irrelevant. The state also argues that Appellant did not testify that he acted under a sudden passion or a fit of rage. Even so, the state points out that words are generally insufficient to support a voluntary manslaughter claim. There are four separate evidentiary issues within this assignment of error, including the admissibility of: (1) evidence pertaining to sexual abuse involving T.J., (2) evidence pertaining to sexual abuse involving a childhood acquaintance, (3) evidence of a head injury Appellant suffered as a child, and (4) testimony from Appellant’s mother and sister pertaining to the abuse inflicted by T.J. While each argument is related, a distinct analysis of each is required. Appellant was diagnosed with PTSD. According to Dr. McPherson’s report, her diagnosis was based on an interview with Appellant, psychological testing, ancillary information, and an interview with Appellant’s sister. Appellant’s sister spoke to Dr. McPherson about an incident where she observed Appellant and T.J. engaging in inappropriate behavior. The report detailed the alleged sexual abuse of Appellant by T.J. and was consistent with Appellant’s testimony; however, the report provided a more in-depth look at the abuse. The report also addressed abuse Appellant suffered from a childhood acquaintance and a head injury he suffered as a child. These latter two incidents are limited to a few lines in the report. According to the report, Appellant’s coping mechanism involves a high level of emotional reactivity due to the extent of his trauma. The report also noted that Appellant has an issue with male sexuality due to T.J. subjecting him to male partners at a young age. Dr. McPherson found that Appellant’s description of the abuse was consistent with her test results. Based on the testing, Dr. McPherson diagnosed Appellant with major depressive disorder, PTSD as a result of multiple sexual abuse experiences, and substance abuse and dependance. Dr. McPherson opined that the abuse perpetrated by T.J. is considered extreme based on Appellant’s repeated victimization. Child Abuse - T.J. The leading case regarding child abuse that results in the killing of the abuser is Nemeth. In Nemeth, the defendant’s mother violently physically abused him for several years. Id. at 202. On the date of the incident, the defendant’s mother was abusive and, believing his life was in danger, he killed her. The defense sought to introduce a report diagnosing him with PTSD/battered child syndrome for purpose of establishing a self-defense claim and as a justification for a lesser included offense to murder. Id. at 204. At oral argument in the instant case, the state suggested that Nemeth is limited to cases involving violent abuse and does not apply to cases involving sexual abuse. Contrary to the state’s claim, there is no support for the argument that Nemeth is limited to violent abuse, alone. Nemeth clearly articulates a general rule that expert testimony is admissible if it is relevant. While it is true that Nemeth involved violent abuse, nothing within the opinion limits its application to that type of abuse. In fact, the oral arguments in Nemeth relied on a case involving sexual abuse and this is discussed in Nemeth. Nemeth, 82 Ohio St.3d at 207, 694 N.E.2d 1332 (1998), citing State v. Stowers, 81 Ohio St.3d 260, 690 N.E.2d 881 (1998); Nemeth at fn. 1, citing Stowers, supra. While Stowers did not involve the death of the abuser, it did involve the admissibility of expert testimony on the issue of whether a violently abused child fits the general characteristics observed in sexually abused children. Id. at 262. The Nemeth Court applied Stowers’ guiding principles and determined that “[g]eneral information on battered child syndrome would also tend to show that [the defendant’s] behavior was consistent with that of an abused child and would lend support to his testimony that he had been abused both generally and just prior to the killing.” Nemeth at 207, citing Stowers, at 262. If the Nemeth Court found it appropriate to rely on Stowers, then it stands to reason that Nemeth is applicable to sexual abuse cases where expert testimony is offered by the defense. Notably, Nemeth has been applied to several other cases involving sexual abuse. See State v. Butts, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 108381, 2020-Ohio-1498; State v. Slaven, 5th Dist. Delaware No. 12 CAA 08 0062, 2013-Ohio-3552; State v. Jennings, 10th Dist. Franklin 2001 WL 1045490 (Sept. 13, 2001). Although none of these cases involved the death of the abuser, their reliance on Nemeth furthers the proposition that this case is not limited to physically violent child abuse claims, but stands for the proposition that if expert testimony is relevant and satisfies Evid.R. 702, it is admissible. Significantly, the Nemeth Court specifically stated that: The defense in this case did not ask that battered child syndrome be recognized as a new defense or an independent justification for the killing of an abusive parent. The proffer made at trial was limited to expert testimony that would explain the psychological effects of long-term child abuse, and was proffered in support of a self-defense theory as well as a charge on voluntary manslaughter. As such, the issue before us is an evidentiary matter and is governed by the Ohio Rules of Evidence. Because there was no basis for excluding the testimony under the Rules of Evidence, and because we find that the trial court's exclusion of this testimony to be prejudicial to the defendant, we need not reach the constitutional issues addressed by the court of appeals. Id. at 206-207. We note that the state relies on State v. Hamad, 11th Dist. Trumbull No. 2017-T-0108, 2019-Ohio-2664, appeal not allowed, 157 Ohio St.3d 1466, 2019-Ohio-4419, 133 N.E.3d 537. However, Hamad is readily distinguishable from the instant case. In Hamad, the record demonstrated that “there [was] no history of physical abuse between the victims.” Id. at ¶ 98. The record also showed that “[u]ntil the assault and shooting took place on February 25, only verbal threats and harassing behavior had been exchanged” between the defendant and victim. Id. In the instant case, there was an attempt to present evidence of a lengthy history of sexual abuse that appears to span more than two decades. Hamad did not involve either violent physical or sexual abuse. Instead, it involved “an exchange of offensive communications” that led to a physical confrontation. Id. at ¶ 2. The state also argues that Nemeth does not apply because Dr. McPherson diagnosed Appellant with PTSD, not battered child syndrome. This argument ignores the plain language of Nemeth, which explained that battered child syndrome has many labels, including PTSD. The Nemeth Court noted that the psychological effects and behavioral symptoms have long been recognized by the medical and legal professions regardless of which term is used. *Id.* at 206. In the trial court’s decision to grant the state’s motion in this case, the court referenced *Nemeth* but relied on *State v. Fulmer*, 117 Ohio St.3d 319, 2008-Ohio-936, 883 N.E.2d 1052; *State v. Wilcox*, 70 Ohio St.2d 182, 436 N.E.2d 523 (1982); and *State v. Jackson*, 32 Ohio St.2d 203, 291 N.E.2d 432 (1972). In *Fulmer*, the defendant produced expert testimony that he acted under the influence of an aspirin overdose at the time of the incident. The defense attempted to use the evidence to show that he was “metabolically deranged.” *Id.* at ¶ 64. The Court determined that the evidence was relevant to whether the defendant was capable of forming the requisite intent to commit the crime at issue. *Id.* As such, the Court determined the defense was the functional equivalent of a diminished capacity defense, which is not recognized within Ohio. *Id.* at ¶ 69. In *Wilcox*, the defendant attempted to introduce evidence to show that he was “borderline retarded, schizophrenic, dyslexic, and to be suffering from organic brain syndrome.” *Wilcox*, 70 Ohio St.2d at 182, 436 N.E.2d 523 (1982). The Court held that “a defendant may not offer expert psychiatric testimony, unrelated to the insanity defense, to show that the defendant lacked the mental capacity to form the specific mental state required for a particular crime or degree of crime.” *Id.* at 199. In *Jackson*, the defendant similarly attempted to introduce evidence that he was suffering from a mental disease or defect which so impaired his reason at the time of the criminal act that he did not act knowingly. *Id.* at 205-206. In a limited analysis, the Court explained that in order to attack intent based on capacity, a defendant must show that he was either too intoxicated to form intent (a state of unconsciousness) or have such “defect of reason as not to know the nature and quality of the illegal act or that it is wrong (insane).” *Id.* at 206. We note that *Fulmer* was decided after *Nemeth* but does not cite to *Nemeth*. This is because the two cases address wholly separate issues. *Fulmer*, along with *Jackson* and *Wilcox*, address evidence of an impaired mental state which is intended to show that the defendant did not act knowingly, whereas *Nemeth* addresses evidence of an abusive relationship between the victim and defendant in order to support either a self-defense instruction or voluntary manslaughter charge. As the evidence in this case was sought in an attempt to show that the history of abuse caused Appellant to become enraged and act with sudden passion, and not to argue that he was so impaired he lacked the ability to understand the nature of his actions, *Nemeth* and not *Fulmer, Jackson*, and *Wilcox*, applies. In accordance with *Nemeth*, such evidence is admissible so long as it is relevant and meets the criteria of Evid.R. 702. *Id.* at 207. Pursuant to Evid.R. 401: “‘Relevant evidence’ means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.” The state contends that the evidence is irrelevant, relying on *State v. Sallie*, 81 Ohio St.3d 673, 693 N.E.2d 267 (1998). However, *Sallie* is also readily distinguishable from the instant matter. The issue before the *Sallie* Court was whether trial counsel provided ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to argue that the defendant suffered from battered woman’s syndrome. At trial, however, the defendant did not claim self-defense. Rather, she claimed the shooting was an accident. As the defendant claimed the shooting was accidental, and not a conscious act of self-defense, the Court concluded that any evidence regarding battered woman’s syndrome was irrelevant. *Id.* at 676. The *Nemeth* Court held that evidence of child abuse is relevant to the determination of whether the accused “had acted with prior calculation and design as charged in the indictment, (2) had acted with purpose as required for the lesser included offense of murder, (3) had created the confrontation or initiated the confrontation or initiated the aggression, and (4) had an honest belief that he was in imminent danger.” *Id.* at 207. Relevant to the instant matter, the *Nemeth* Court also explained that Expert testimony on battered child syndrome would, in this case, tend to enhance the probability that [the defendant’s] account of the facts leading up to the killing was truthful and would lend credibility to his assertion that he was in a state of rage and dissociation at the time of the killing. A diagnosis of battered child syndrome and an explanation of its effects would therefore be relevant in determining whether the case warranted a jury charge on voluntary manslaughter. *Id.* at 207-208. At the outset, it is important to consider the *Nemeth* court’s explanation that “[t]he triggering event for posttraumatic stress disorder can be any traumatic event that involved ‘actual or threatened death or serious injury, or a threat to the physical integrity of self or others’ and where the person’s response involved ‘intense fear, helplessness, or horror.” *Id.* at 212. The Court explained that these responses are triggered by an “interpersonal stressor” that can manifest itself in “fear and anxiety, abnormal expressions of aggression or impaired impulse control, reenacting or physiologically reexperiencing the abuse, avoidance (often in the form of hypervigilance), helplessness, somatic complaints, and various forms of dissociation.” *Id.* at 213. As in *Nemeth*, Appellant argues that Dr. McPherson’s report and testimony was relevant to lend credence to his account of the facts leading up to the killing and to provide credibility for his assertion that he was in a state of rage at the time of the incident, both of which are aspects of his voluntary manslaughter argument. He also contends that the evidence is admissible to rebut the state’s repeated comments that he could not corroborate his abuse claims, and to dispel any misconceptions the jurors may have had as to why he did not previously inform anyone of the abuse. We begin our review of Appellant’s voluntary manslaughter argument by noting that the trial court did instruct the jury on voluntary manslaughter. Thus, the trial court implicitly found that Appellant’s testimony, limited as it was, provided a sufficient basis to warrant a voluntary manslaughter instruction. However, contrary to the state’s contentions, we cannot limit our analysis of Appellant’s voluntary manslaughter argument to his testimony, alone. This is because the question before us is whether Dr. McPherson’s report and testimony would have made a voluntary manslaughter conviction more or less probable. Thus, in determining whether that evidence is relevant, we must also consider the extent of what Dr. McPherson’s report and potential testimony would have added to Appellant’s testimony. In beginning our review of Appellant’s testimony, we first address the state’s assertion that a defendant must specifically state legal “buzzwords” such as “sudden passion” and “fit of rage” within their testimony. This assertion is incorrect. Unlike attorneys, lay members of society tend to lack the legal knowledge and sophistication to articulate these terms. Even without using those specific terms, a defendant can sufficiently demonstrate the concepts by describing emotions, actions, or reactions that emulate this standard. Here, Appellant did not explicitly use the phrases “sudden passion” or “fit of rage” during his testimony. Thus, we review his testimony to determine whether the substance of that testimony established facts that would show “sudden passion” and “a fit of rage.” According to Appellant, T.J. became physical with him, throwing things at him and charging at him with a glass snow globe in her hand. Prior to that, she made sexual advances towards him while becoming verbally abusive. The state discounts the language used by T.J. by arguing that words alone are insufficient to establish sudden passion. While the state is generally correct, this is the point where the expert report and testimony of Dr. McPherson become essential to Appellant’s claims. It is Dr. McPherson’s report that links the decades of sexual abuse and sexual confusion to the import these words and actions had on Appellant’s behavior. For instance, Dr. McPherson’s report states that T.J. used the sexual abuse to “toy” with Appellant. Applied to the events leading up to the killing, T.J placed Appellant’s hand on her crotch, pushed her chest against him and questioned his love for her. Her actions in making sexual advances while questioning his love for her could be construed as “toying” with his emotions. Thus, what is important here are not just the words themselves but also the history of the abuse combined with the sexual advancements and the effect that combination had on Appellant’s emotional state. During the altercation, T.J. questioned Appellant’s sexuality by calling him a “faggot” and telling him he did not know how to be a man. Again, in order to understand the significance of this, Appellant cites to the report where Dr. McPherson opines that T.J. caused sexual confusion in Appellant by subjecting him to male sexual partners at a young age. In other words, Dr. McPherson links the decade of T.J.’s abuse to Appellant’s reaction to T.J.’s words, sexual advances, and physical outburst and explains how this combination could have triggered Appellant, causing him to react in the way that he did, resulting in T.J.’s death. During cross examination, the state responded to Appellant’s description of T.J.’s verbal abuse by asking, “[h]ave you heard of sticks and stones?” (Trial Tr., p. 704.) Appellant responded, “[m]a’am, she is hitting me. With all of her past history, my emotional state at the time --.” (Trial Tr., p. 704.) Before Appellant could finish his sentence, the trial court sustained an objection by the state. It is unclear why the trial court sustained the objection. However, from this limited excerpt it is clear Appellant tried to explain his emotions and why T.J.’s words and actions caused him to react in the manner he did, but he was not permitted to provide that testimony. As discussed at length in Nemeth, testimony of an abusive relationship between the victim and defendant is relevant to demonstrate the “triggering event” of PTSD. The event need not rise to the level of threat of death or serious injury but can be “a threat to the physical integrity of self or others.” Id. at 212. The Court explained that this triggering event is relevant to behavior such as “abnormal expressions of aggression or impaired impulse control” and various forms of dissociation. *Id.* at 213. We note that in Dr. McPherson’s report she determined that Appellant’s coping mechanism involved a high level of emotional reactivity. The state also repeatedly confronted Appellant with the lack of corroboration of Appellant’s testimony that he was abused by T.J. For instance, the state commented: “[s]o what is [Appellant] going to do? He is going to attack the only person that can contradict his story, the woman he killed. He is going to blame her for his behavior. He is going to tell you through no corroboration that they were having an affair * * *.” (Trial Tr., pp. 778-779.) The prosecution said it was “convenient” that Appellant never filed a police report regarding his abuse nor had any witnesses to corroborate the abuse. (Trial Tr., p., 713.) Again, we note that Appellant’s corroborating witnesses in this regard were not permitted to testify. The state also questioned why none of the witnesses knew of the abuse, despite the fact that the state was aware of the conclusions in Dr. McPherson’s report and that Appellant was prevented from having other witnesses testify. The *Nemeth* Court emphasized that evidence of battered child syndrome is particularly relevant to dispel a juror’s misconception that if abuse had occurred, the victim would have told someone or filed a police report. The Court explained that “[i]t is the lack of corroborating evidence that makes expert testimony even more crucial in these cases. The defense needs expert testimony to refute the seemingly logical conclusion that serious abuse could not be taking place if no one outside the home was aware of it.” *Id.* at 209. In addressing this issue, the case relies on *State v. Gray*, 2nd Dist. Montgomery No. 26473, 2016-Ohio-5869. *Gray* involved a murder committed by a person who had allegedly suffered sexual abuse earlier in his life. Importantly, the appellant’s victim was not his abuser. The appellant attempted to claim that he killed the victim because he had been abused by someone else, that this abuse caused him to have a violent reaction sufficient to excuse his killing of the victim. The expert report and testimony that was offered concluded that “that the defendant's abnormal mental condition shows that the defendant did not have the specific mental state required for the crime, though he was aware that his action was wrong and was able to control it.” *Id.*, at ¶ 27. The Second District held that the evidence appellant offered: [Did] not fit the rationale given for the exceptions in battered-syndrome cases. Whatever problems [the defendant] has, they are not the result of abuse by [the victim]. Also, [the defendant] does not mention any common misconceptions that [the doctor’s] testimony would dispel. He argues only that her testimony would help the jury understand why the events of his childhood might explain his extreme response to the alleged threat posed by [the victim]. *Id.* at ¶ 32. In other words, the evidence did not show that the defendant suffered “from battered-woman syndrome or battered-child syndrome as a result of abuse at the hands of the ‘victim.’ ” *Id.* at ¶ 31. Instead, he attempted to rely on prior abuse by someone other than the victim to explain why he killed the victim. *Gray* does appear to be an example of a “diminished capacity” case, and as earlier discussed, this theory does not exist in Ohio as a defense. Thus, Gray is clearly distinguishable from the instant matter even though both cases involve sexual abuse. In summation, the admissibility of evidence concerning any kind of abuse is governed by Nemeth. Admission of the evidence in the instant matter was solely sought to explain the psychological effects of the long-term sexual abuse in order to justify and support voluntary manslaughter. The evidence was also relevant to rebut the state’s repeated insistence that Appellant could not corroborate his abuse and the inference that he was lying about the abuse. As the evidence is relevant, the issue becomes whether it is admissible under Evid.R. 702. Pursuant to Evid.R. 702, a witness may testify as an expert if all of the following apply: (A) The witness' testimony either relates to matters beyond the knowledge or experience possessed by lay persons or dispels a misconception common among lay persons; (B) The witness is qualified as an expert by specialized knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education regarding the subject matter of the testimony; (C) The witness' testimony is based on reliable scientific, technical, or other specialized information.* * * As addressed by the Nemeth Court, evidence of battered child syndrome is necessary to assist the jury where there is a lack of corroborating evidence “as a trier of fact is likely to believe that the abuse allegations are fabricated in response to the charges levied against the child-defendant.” *Id.* at 209. Additionally, the Court explained that the evidence assists in helping the jury to understand the effects of the abuse as “[p]rolonged exposure to abuse results in feelings of powerlessness, embarrassment, fear of reprisal, isolation, and low self-esteem.” *Id.* at 208. The same rationale applies to those charged as an adult. *Id.* at 209, citing *Koss, supra.* Dr. McPherson’s report and testimony fall squarely into this category. As to the second prong of Evid.R. 702, the record does not reflect that the state objected to or otherwise questioned Dr. McPherson’s qualifications. Hence, we may infer that the witness satisfied the second prong of the test. As to the third prong, the *Nemeth* Court held that “the behavioral and psychological effects of prolonged child abuse on the child have been generally accepted in the medical and psychiatric communities and therefore unquestionably meet the requisite level of reliability for admission as the subject of expert testimony.” *Id.* at 212. Thus, the evidence is based on scientific information. As to prejudice, the *Nemeth* Court set forth two reasons for their holding: “[b]ecause there was no basis for excluding the testimony under the Rules of Evidence, and because we find that the trial court’s exclusion of this testimony to be prejudicial to the defendant * * *.” *Id.* at 207. It appears axiomatic that a defendant will be prejudiced by the exclusion of otherwise relevant, partially exculpable evidence. To the extent that prejudice must be shown, this jury did not find Appellant guilty of the most serious offenses with which he was charged, aggravated murder and aggravated robbery. Based on the jury’s failure to find Appellant guilty of these two offenses, it can be inferred that jury believed Appellant’s testimony at least in part. Based on the jury’s reluctance to convict Appellant on the most serious offenses, the improperly excluded evidence could very well have resulted in a conviction on voluntary manslaughter instead of murder. Thus, this record reveals that Appellant was prejudiced by the exclusion of the evidence.\"\n}\n```"}

In *Wilcox*, the defendant attempted to introduce evidence to show that he was “borderline retarded, schizophrenic, dyslexic, and to be suffering from organic brain syndrome.” *Wilcox*, 70 Ohio St.2d at 182, 436 N.E.2d 523 (1982). The Court held that “a defendant may not offer expert psychiatric testimony, unrelated to the insanity defense, to show that the defendant lacked the mental capacity to form the specific mental state required for a particular crime or degree of crime.” *Id.* at 199. In *Jackson*, the defendant similarly attempted to introduce evidence that he was suffering from a mental disease or defect which so impaired his reason at the time of the criminal act that he did not act knowingly. *Id.* at 205-206. In a limited analysis, the Court explained that in order to attack intent based on capacity, a defendant must show that he was either too intoxicated to form intent (a state of unconsciousness) or have such “defect of reason as not to know the nature and quality of the illegal act or that it is wrong (insane).” *Id.* at 206. We note that *Fulmer* was decided after *Nemeth* but does not cite to *Nemeth*. This is because the two cases address wholly separate issues. *Fulmer*, along with *Jackson* and *Wilcox*, address evidence of an impaired mental state which is intended to show that the defendant did not act knowingly, whereas *Nemeth* addresses evidence of an abusive relationship between the victim and defendant in order to support either a self-defense instruction or voluntary manslaughter charge. As the evidence in this case was sought in an attempt to show that the history of abuse caused Appellant to become enraged and act with sudden passion, and not to argue that he was so impaired he lacked the ability to understand the nature of his actions, *Nemeth* and not *Fulmer, Jackson*, and *Wilcox*, applies. In accordance with *Nemeth*, such evidence is admissible so long as it is relevant and meets the criteria of Evid.R. 702. *Id.* at 207. Pursuant to Evid.R. 401: “‘Relevant evidence’ means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.” The state contends that the evidence is irrelevant, relying on *State v. Sallie*, 81 Ohio St.3d 673, 693 N.E.2d 267 (1998). However, *Sallie* is also readily distinguishable from the instant matter. The issue before the *Sallie* Court was whether trial counsel provided ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to argue that the defendant suffered from battered woman’s syndrome. At trial, however, the defendant did not claim self-defense. Rather, she claimed the shooting was an accident. As the defendant claimed the shooting was accidental, and not a conscious act of self-defense, the Court concluded that any evidence regarding battered woman’s syndrome was irrelevant. *Id.* at 676. The *Nemeth* Court held that evidence of child abuse is relevant to the determination of whether the accused “had acted with prior calculation and design as charged in the indictment, (2) had acted with purpose as required for the lesser included offense of murder, (3) had created the confrontation or initiated the confrontation or initiated the aggression, and (4) had an honest belief that he was in imminent danger.” *Id.* at 207. Relevant to the instant matter, the *Nemeth* Court also explained that Expert testimony on battered child syndrome would, in this case, tend to enhance the probability that [the defendant’s] account of the facts leading up to the killing was truthful and would lend credibility to his assertion that he was in a state of rage and dissociation at the time of the killing. A diagnosis of battered child syndrome and an explanation of its effects would therefore be relevant in determining whether the case warranted a jury charge on voluntary manslaughter. *Id.* at 207-208. At the outset, it is important to consider the *Nemeth* court’s explanation that “[t]he triggering event for posttraumatic stress disorder can be any traumatic event that involved ‘actual or threatened death or serious injury, or a threat to the physical integrity of self or others’ and where the person’s response involved ‘intense fear, helplessness, or horror.” *Id.* at 212. The Court explained that these responses are triggered by an “interpersonal stressor” that can manifest itself in “fear and anxiety, abnormal expressions of aggression or impaired impulse control, reenacting or physiologically reexperiencing the abuse, avoidance (often in the form of hypervigilance), helplessness, somatic complaints, and various forms of dissociation.” *Id.* at 213. As in *Nemeth*, Appellant argues that Dr. McPherson’s report and testimony was relevant to lend credence to his account of the facts leading up to the killing and to provide credibility for his assertion that he was in a state of rage at the time of the incident, both of which are aspects of his voluntary manslaughter argument. He also contends that the evidence is admissible to rebut the state’s repeated comments that he could not corroborate his abuse claims, and to dispel any misconceptions the jurors may have had as to why he did not previously inform anyone of the abuse. We begin our review of Appellant’s voluntary manslaughter argument by noting that the trial court did instruct the jury on voluntary manslaughter. Thus, the trial court implicitly found that Appellant’s testimony, limited as it was, provided a sufficient basis to warrant a voluntary manslaughter instruction. However, contrary to the state’s contentions, we cannot limit our analysis of Appellant’s voluntary manslaughter argument to his testimony, alone. This is because the question before us is whether Dr. McPherson’s report and testimony would have made a voluntary manslaughter conviction more or less probable. Thus, in determining whether that evidence is relevant, we must also consider the extent of what Dr. McPherson’s report and potential testimony would have added to Appellant’s testimony. In beginning our review of Appellant’s testimony, we first address the state’s assertion that a defendant must specifically state legal “buzzwords” such as “sudden passion” and “fit of rage” within their testimony. This assertion is incorrect. Unlike attorneys, lay members of society tend to lack the legal knowledge and sophistication to articulate these terms. Even without using those specific terms, a defendant can sufficiently demonstrate the concepts by describing emotions, actions, or reactions that emulate this standard. Here, Appellant did not explicitly use the phrases “sudden passion” or “fit of rage” during his testimony. Thus, we review his testimony to determine whether the substance of that testimony established facts that would show “sudden passion” and “a fit of rage.” According to Appellant, T.J. became physical with him, throwing things at him and charging at him with a glass snow globe in her hand. Prior to that, she made sexual advances towards him while becoming verbally abusive. The state discounts the language used by T.J. by arguing that words alone are insufficient to establish sudden passion. While the state is generally correct, this is the point where the expert report and testimony of Dr. McPherson become essential to Appellant’s claims. It is Dr. McPherson’s report that links the decades of sexual abuse and sexual confusion to the import these words and actions had on Appellant’s behavior. For instance, Dr. McPherson’s report states that T.J. used the sexual abuse to “toy” with Appellant. Applied to the events leading up to the killing, T.J placed Appellant’s hand on her crotch, pushed her chest against him and questioned his love for her. Her actions in making sexual advances while questioning his love for her could be construed as “toying” with his emotions. Thus, what is important here are not just the words themselves but also the history of the abuse combined with the sexual advancements and the effect that combination had on Appellant’s emotional state. During the altercation, T.J. questioned Appellant’s sexuality by calling him a “faggot” and telling him he did not know how to be a man. Again, in order to understand the significance of this, Appellant cites to the report where Dr. McPherson opines that T.J. caused sexual confusion in Appellant by subjecting him to male sexual partners at a young age. In other words, Dr. McPherson links the decade of T.J.’s abuse to Appellant’s reaction to T.J.’s words, sexual advances, and physical outburst and explains how this combination could have triggered Appellant, causing him to react in the way that he did, resulting in T.J.’s death. During cross examination, the state responded to Appellant’s description of T.J.’s verbal abuse by asking, “[h]ave you heard of sticks and stones?” (Trial Tr., p. 704.) Appellant responded, “[m]a’am, she is hitting me. With all of her past history, my emotional state at the time --.” (Trial Tr., p. 704.) Before Appellant could finish his sentence, the trial court sustained an objection by the state. It is unclear why the trial court sustained the objection. However, from this limited excerpt it is clear Appellant tried to explain his emotions and why T.J.’s words and actions caused him to react in the manner he did, but he was not permitted to provide that testimony. As discussed at length in Nemeth, testimony of an abusive relationship between the victim and defendant is relevant to demonstrate the “triggering event” of PTSD. The event need not rise to the level of threat of death or serious injury but can be “a threat to the physical integrity of self or others.” Id. at 212. The Court explained that this triggering event is relevant to behavior such as “abnormal expressions of aggression or impaired impulse control” and various forms of dissociation. *Id.* at 213. We note that in Dr. McPherson’s report she determined that Appellant’s coping mechanism involved a high level of emotional reactivity. The state also repeatedly confronted Appellant with the lack of corroboration of Appellant’s testimony that he was abused by T.J. For instance, the state commented: “[s]o what is [Appellant] going to do? He is going to attack the only person that can contradict his story, the woman he killed. He is going to blame her for his behavior. He is going to tell you through no corroboration that they were having an affair * * *.” (Trial Tr., pp. 778-779.) The prosecution said it was “convenient” that Appellant never filed a police report regarding his abuse nor had any witnesses to corroborate the abuse. (Trial Tr., p., 713.) Again, we note that Appellant’s corroborating witnesses in this regard were not permitted to testify. The state also questioned why none of the witnesses knew of the abuse, despite the fact that the state was aware of the conclusions in Dr. McPherson’s report and that Appellant was prevented from having other witnesses testify. The *Nemeth* Court emphasized that evidence of battered child syndrome is particularly relevant to dispel a juror’s misconception that if abuse had occurred, the victim would have told someone or filed a police report. The Court explained that “[i]t is the lack of corroborating evidence that makes expert testimony even more crucial in these cases. The defense needs expert testimony to refute the seemingly logical conclusion that serious abuse could not be taking place if no one outside the home was aware of it.” *Id.* at 209. In addressing this issue, the case relies on *State v. Gray*, 2nd Dist. Montgomery No. 26473, 2016-Ohio-5869. *Gray* involved a murder committed by a person who had allegedly suffered sexual abuse earlier in his life. Importantly, the appellant’s victim was not his abuser. The appellant attempted to claim that he killed the victim because he had been abused by someone else, that this abuse caused him to have a violent reaction sufficient to excuse his killing of the victim. The expert report and testimony that was offered concluded that “that the defendant's abnormal mental condition shows that the defendant did not have the specific mental state required for the crime, though he was aware that his action was wrong and was able to control it.” *Id.*, at ¶ 27. The Second District held that the evidence appellant offered: [Did] not fit the rationale given for the exceptions in battered-syndrome cases. Whatever problems [the defendant] has, they are not the result of abuse by [the victim]. Also, [the defendant] does not mention any common misconceptions that [the doctor’s] testimony would dispel. He argues only that her testimony would help the jury understand why the events of his childhood might explain his extreme response to the alleged threat posed by [the victim]. *Id.* at ¶ 32. In other words, the evidence did not show that the defendant suffered “from battered-woman syndrome or battered-child syndrome as a result of abuse at the hands of the ‘victim.’ ” *Id.* at ¶ 31. Instead, he attempted to rely on prior abuse by someone other than the victim to explain why he killed the victim. *Gray* does appear to be an example of a “diminished capacity” case, and as earlier discussed, this theory does not exist in Ohio as a defense. Thus, Gray is clearly distinguishable from the instant matter even though both cases involve sexual abuse. In summation, the admissibility of evidence concerning any kind of abuse is governed by Nemeth. Admission of the evidence in the instant matter was solely sought to explain the psychological effects of the long-term sexual abuse in order to justify and support voluntary manslaughter. The evidence was also relevant to rebut the state’s repeated insistence that Appellant could not corroborate his abuse and the inference that he was lying about the abuse. As the evidence is relevant, the issue becomes whether it is admissible under Evid.R. 702. Pursuant to Evid.R. 702, a witness may testify as an expert if all of the following apply: (A) The witness' testimony either relates to matters beyond the knowledge or experience possessed by lay persons or dispels a misconception common among lay persons; (B) The witness is qualified as an expert by specialized knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education regarding the subject matter of the testimony; (C) The witness' testimony is based on reliable scientific, technical, or other specialized information.* * * As addressed by the Nemeth Court, evidence of battered child syndrome is necessary to assist the jury where there is a lack of corroborating evidence “as a trier of fact is likely to believe that the abuse allegations are fabricated in response to the charges levied against the child-defendant.” *Id.* at 209. Additionally, the Court explained that the evidence assists in helping the jury to understand the effects of the abuse as “[p]rolonged exposure to abuse results in feelings of powerlessness, embarrassment, fear of reprisal, isolation, and low self-esteem.” *Id.* at 208. The same rationale applies to those charged as an adult. *Id.* at 209, citing *Koss, supra.* Dr. McPherson’s report and testimony fall squarely into this category. As to the second prong of Evid.R. 702, the record does not reflect that the state objected to or otherwise questioned Dr. McPherson’s qualifications. Hence, we may infer that the witness satisfied the second prong of the test. As to the third prong, the *Nemeth* Court held that “the behavioral and psychological effects of prolonged child abuse on the child have been generally accepted in the medical and psychiatric communities and therefore unquestionably meet the requisite level of reliability for admission as the subject of expert testimony.” *Id.* at 212. Thus, the evidence is based on scientific information. As to prejudice, the *Nemeth* Court set forth two reasons for their holding: “[b]ecause there was no basis for excluding the testimony under the Rules of Evidence, and because we find that the trial court’s exclusion of this testimony to be prejudicial to the defendant * * *.” *Id.* at 207. It appears axiomatic that a defendant will be prejudiced by the exclusion of otherwise relevant, partially exculpable evidence. To the extent that prejudice must be shown, this jury did not find Appellant guilty of the most serious offenses with which he was charged, aggravated murder and aggravated robbery. Based on the jury’s failure to find Appellant guilty of these two offenses, it can be inferred that jury believed Appellant’s testimony at least in part. Based on the jury’s reluctance to convict Appellant on the most serious offenses, the improperly excluded evidence could very well have resulted in a conviction on voluntary manslaughter instead of murder. Thus, this record reveals that Appellant was prejudiced by the exclusion of the evidence.\"\n}\n```"}

Seneca Nos. 13-12-26, 13-13-04, 2013-Ohio-4975, ¶ 25. ‘A person has ‘actual possession’ of an item if the item is within his immediate physical possession.’ State v. Watts, 3rd Dist.

Specifically, Kunkleman testified that on March 21, 2014 at approximately 3:20 a.m., he was dispatched to a report of a suspicious vehicle sitting in the parking lot of 234 North Main Street. (Trial, 08/01/2017 Tr., Vol. I at 63-64). Kunkleman pulled up behind the vehicle to run the plates, and noticed that an African-American male was sitting in the driver’s seat. (*Id.* at 66). The male, who was later identified as Appellant, was the sole individual in the vehicle. (*Id.*). As Kunkleman exited his vehicle, Appellant exited the vehicle in which he was sitting. (Id. at 67). Appellant then began walking towards Kunkleman, and refused to engage him in conversation. (Id.). Shortly thereafter, Appellant turned around and walked back to towards the vehicle. (Id.). Kunkleman followed Appellant back to the vehicle, and noticed the overwhelming smell of marijuana coming from the car. (Id. at 68). Appellant was observed leaning into the driver’s compartment and grabbing at something on the floorboard. (Id.). Appellant refused to comply with Kunkleman’s request to exit the vehicle, and as a result Kunkleman pulled him away from the vehicle for officer safety. (Id.). Hillard, who had arrived at the scene simultaneously with Kunkleman, looked inside the vehicle and found a paper bag with cocaine in it sticking out from under the driver’s seat. (Id. at 66, 71). Upon searching the center armrest, Kunkleman found a baggie that contained heroin inside it. (Id. at 71). Upon conducting a pat down of Appellant for officer safety, a large amount of money (over $5,000) was located on Appellant’s person. (Id. at 70).\\n\\n{¶52} This evidence, when viewed in a light most favorable to the State, could lead a rational trier of fact to find that Appellant had constructive possession of the drugs in the vehicle. Appellant was the only person in the vehicle at the time of the stop. Further, the drugs in the vehicle were located on the driver’s side floorboard and the center console, in the proximity of Appellant’s position as the driver. While proximity to drugs alone is insufficient to establish constructive possession, proximity to the object does constitute some evidence of constructive possession. State v. Rodgers, 3rd Dist. Hancock No. 5-10-35, 2011-Ohio-3003, ¶ 30. Lastly, Appellant’s furtive movements in the area where the cocaine was located is indicative of knowledge and possession.\\n\\n{¶53} Given Appellant’s conduct and the attending facts, we conclude that a rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crimes proven beyond a reasonable doubt in case number CR 2014 0118.\\n\\n*Analysis – Case Number CR 2015 0361*\\n\\n{¶54} Pertinent to this appeal, in case number CR 2015 0361, Appellant was found guilty in Count I of possession of drugs (cocaine), guilty in Count II of possession of drugs (heroin), and guilty in Count III of possession of drugs (marijuana), all in violation of R.C. 2925.11(A), which states:\\n\\n(A) No person shall knowingly obtain, possess, or use a controlled substance or a controlled substance analog.\\n\\n(Emphasis added). R.C. 2925.11(A).\\n\\n{¶55} In Count IV, Appellant was charged with illegal cultivation of marijuana, in violation of R.C. 2925.04(A), which states:\\n\\n(A) No person shall knowingly cultivate marihuana or knowingly manufacture or otherwise engage in any part of the production of a controlled substance.\\n\\nR.C. 2925.04(A).\\n\\nIn Count V, Appellant was charged with having weapons while under disability, in violation of R.C. 2923.13(A)(3), which states:\\n\\n(A) Unless relieved from disability under operation of law or legal process, no person shall knowingly acquire, have, carry, or use any firearm or dangerous ordnance, if any of the following apply:\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n(3) The person is under indictment for or has been convicted of any felony offense involving the illegal possession, use, sale, administration, distribution, or trafficking in any drug of abuse or has been adjudicated a delinquent child for the commission of an offense that, if committed by an adult, would have been a felony offense involving the illegal possession, use, sale, administration, distribution, or trafficking in any drug of abuse.\\n\\nR.C. 2923.13(A)(3).\\n\\nIn support of his sufficiency-of-the-evidence challenge, Appellant argues that the State failed to provide evidence that linked Appellant with the contraband found at 1222 Catalpa Street. We find otherwise. Specifically, testimony at trial revealed that after Appellant was arrested, Appellant told law enforcement officials that: ‘I don’t live here. I’m just seeing a girl.’ (Trial, 08/02/2017 Tr., Vol. I, at 145). But, when law enforcement questioned Appellant about the ‘girl,’ Appellant wasn’t able to provide any information about her to law enforcement. (Id.).\\n\\nMoreover, after the search warrant was executed, authorities found a book bag in a bedroom closet that contained: a VISA gift card with Appellant’s name on it; a medical marijuana card with Appellant’s personal identifiers on it; a Huntington Bank VISA card with Appellant’s name on it; and Appellant’s social security card and birth certificate. (Id., Vol. II at 242). Also located within the residence were three handguns. (Id., Vol. I 187-88). Authorities failed to find any women’s or children’s clothing in the residence. (Id., Vol. II at 245). Contrary to Appellant’s argument on appeal, there was competent and credible evidence that Appellant was the sole occupant of 1222 Catalpa Street at the time of the arrest, the protective sweep, and when the search occurred in the residence. We find that Appellant’s theory of possession is inconsistent with the evidence.\\n\\n{¶59} After viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, we find that a rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crimes charged proven beyond a reasonable doubt in case number CR 2015 0361. Accordingly, we overrule Appellant’s first assignment of error in its entirety.\"\n}\n```"}

Seneca Nos. 13-12-26, 13-13-04, 2013-Ohio-4975, ¶ 25. ‘A person has ‘actual possession’ of an item if the item is within his immediate physical possession.’ State v. Watts, 3rd Dist.

Specifically, Kunkleman testified that on March 21, 2014 at approximately 3:20 a.m., he was dispatched to a report of a suspicious vehicle sitting in the parking lot of 234 North Main Street. (Trial, 08/01/2017 Tr., Vol. I at 63-64). Kunkleman pulled up behind the vehicle to run the plates, and noticed that an African-American male was sitting in the driver’s seat. (*Id.* at 66). The male, who was later identified as Appellant, was the sole individual in the vehicle. (*Id.*). As Kunkleman exited his vehicle, Appellant exited the vehicle in which he was sitting. (Id. at 67). Appellant then began walking towards Kunkleman, and refused to engage him in conversation. (Id.). Shortly thereafter, Appellant turned around and walked back to towards the vehicle. (Id.). Kunkleman followed Appellant back to the vehicle, and noticed the overwhelming smell of marijuana coming from the car. (Id. at 68). Appellant was observed leaning into the driver’s compartment and grabbing at something on the floorboard. (Id.). Appellant refused to comply with Kunkleman’s request to exit the vehicle, and as a result Kunkleman pulled him away from the vehicle for officer safety. (Id.). Hillard, who had arrived at the scene simultaneously with Kunkleman, looked inside the vehicle and found a paper bag with cocaine in it sticking out from under the driver’s seat. (Id. at 66, 71). Upon searching the center armrest, Kunkleman found a baggie that contained heroin inside it. (Id. at 71). Upon conducting a pat down of Appellant for officer safety, a large amount of money (over $5,000) was located on Appellant’s person. (Id. at 70).\\n\\n{¶52} This evidence, when viewed in a light most favorable to the State, could lead a rational trier of fact to find that Appellant had constructive possession of the drugs in the vehicle. Appellant was the only person in the vehicle at the time of the stop. Further, the drugs in the vehicle were located on the driver’s side floorboard and the center console, in the proximity of Appellant’s position as the driver. While proximity to drugs alone is insufficient to establish constructive possession, proximity to the object does constitute some evidence of constructive possession. State v. Rodgers, 3rd Dist.

The male, who was later identified as Appellant, was the sole individual in the vehicle. (*Id.*). As Kunkleman exited his vehicle, Appellant exited the vehicle in which he was sitting. (Id. at 67). Appellant then began walking towards Kunkleman, and refused to engage him in conversation. (Id.). Shortly thereafter, Appellant turned around and walked back to towards the vehicle. (Id.). Kunkleman followed Appellant back to the vehicle, and noticed the overwhelming smell of marijuana coming from the car. (Id. at 68). Appellant was observed leaning into the driver’s compartment and grabbing at something on the floorboard. (Id.). Appellant refused to comply with Kunkleman’s request to exit the vehicle, and as a result Kunkleman pulled him away from the vehicle for officer safety. (Id.). Hillard, who had arrived at the scene simultaneously with Kunkleman, looked inside the vehicle and found a paper bag with cocaine in it sticking out from under the driver’s seat. (Id. at 66, 71). Upon searching the center armrest, Kunkleman found a baggie that contained heroin inside it. (Id. at 71). Upon conducting a pat down of Appellant for officer safety, a large amount of money (over $5,000) was located on Appellant’s person. (Id. at 70).\\n\\n{¶52} This evidence, when viewed in a light most favorable to the State, could lead a rational trier of fact to find that Appellant had constructive possession of the drugs in the vehicle. Appellant was the only person in the vehicle at the time of the stop. Further, the drugs in the vehicle were located on the driver’s side floorboard and the center console, in the proximity of Appellant’s position as the driver. While proximity to drugs alone is insufficient to establish constructive possession, proximity to the object does constitute some evidence of constructive possession. State v. Rodgers, 3rd Dist. Hancock No. 5-10-35, 2011-Ohio-3003, ¶ 30. Lastly, Appellant’s furtive movements in the area where the cocaine was located is indicative of knowledge and possession.\\n\\n{¶53} Given Appellant’s conduct and the attending facts, we conclude that a rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crimes proven beyond a reasonable doubt in case number CR 2014 0118.\\n\\n*Analysis – Case Number CR 2015 0361*\\n\\n{¶54} Pertinent to this appeal, in case number CR 2015 0361, Appellant was found guilty in Count I of possession of drugs (cocaine), guilty in Count II of possession of drugs (heroin), and guilty in Count III of possession of drugs (marijuana), all in violation of R.C. 2925.11(A), which states:\\n\\n(A) No person shall knowingly obtain, possess, or use a controlled substance or a controlled substance analog.\\n\\n(Emphasis added).

We find otherwise. Specifically, testimony at trial revealed that after Appellant was arrested, Appellant told law enforcement officials that: ‘I don’t live here. I’m just seeing a girl.’ (Trial, 08/02/2017 Tr., Vol. I, at 145). But, when law enforcement questioned Appellant about the ‘girl,’ Appellant wasn’t able to provide any information about her to law enforcement. (Id.).\\n\\nMoreover, after the search warrant was executed, authorities found a book bag in a bedroom closet that contained: a VISA gift card with Appellant’s name on it; a medical marijuana card with Appellant’s personal identifiers on it; a Huntington Bank VISA card with Appellant’s name on it; and Appellant’s social security card and birth certificate. (Id., Vol. II at 242). Also located within the residence were three handguns. (Id., Vol. I 187-88). Authorities failed to find any women’s or children’s clothing in the residence. (Id., Vol. II at 245). Contrary to Appellant’s argument on appeal, there was competent and credible evidence that Appellant was the sole occupant of 1222 Catalpa Street at the time of the arrest, the protective sweep, and when the search occurred in the residence. We find that Appellant’s theory of possession is inconsistent with the evidence.\\n\\n{¶59} After viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, we find that a rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crimes charged proven beyond a reasonable doubt in case number CR 2015 0361.

See R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(b). To prove rape in count three, the state had to prove that Svoboda, by force or threat of force, compelled A.S. to engage in sexual conduct.

We disagree. Under the doctrine of cumulative error, '[s]eparately harmless errors may violate a defendant's right to a fair trial when the errors are considered together.' State v. Harris, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 19796, 2004-Ohio-3570, ¶ 40, citing State v. Madrigal, 87 Ohio St.3d 378, 397, 721 N.E.2d 52 (2000). 'In order to find cumulative error, we first must find that multiple errors were committed at trial.' Id. 'A conviction will be reversed when the cumulative effect of errors in a trial deprives a defendant of a fair trial even though each of the numerous instances of trial-court error does not individually constitute cause for reversal.' State v. Powell, 132 Ohio St.3d 233, 2012-Ohio-2577, 971 N.E.2d 865, ¶ 223, citing State v. DeMarco, 31 Ohio St.3d 191, 509 N.E.2d 1256 (1987), paragraph two of the syllabus. Voir Dire Appellant makes two arguments under this first assignment of error. In the first he argues the trial court improperly permitted the state to present factual elements of its case during voir dire over his counsel's objection. We disagree. Because the scope of voir dire lies within the sound discretion of the trial court, we review Appellant's argument for an abuse of discretion. State v. Jackson, 107 Ohio St.3d 53, 2005-Ohio-5981, 836 N.E.2d 1173, ¶ 28. In order to find an abuse of discretion, we must determine the trial court's decision was unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable and not merely an error of law or judgment. Blakemore v. Blakemore, 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 450 N.E.2d 1140 (1983). 'The scope of voir dire * * * varies depending on the circumstances of each case.' State v. Bedford, 39 Ohio St.3d 122, 129, 529 N.E.2d 913 (1988). A prosecutor has a right to give an overview of the facts of the case and of those involved in order to ascertain whether prospective jurors know anything about the offense. State v. Tyler, 50 Ohio St.3d 24, 32, 553 N.E.2d 576 (1990). While jurors must be impartial, they need not be completely ignorant of the facts and issues involved in a case to be qualified as jurors. State v. Gross, 97 Ohio St.3d 121, 2002-Ohio-5524, 776 N.E.2d 1061, ¶ 38. 'The purpose of voir dire is not to establish how a juror will vote on the case to be tried; it is to discover whether any juror has a bias that would prevent him or her from individually weighing the facts of the case.' State v. Madison, 160 Ohio St.3d 232, 2020-Ohio-3735, 155 N.E.3d 867, ¶ 24. In support of his argument that the trial court erred in permitting the state to present factual evidence of its case during voir dire over his counsel's objection, Appellant directs us to pages 128-137 of the transcript. Within these pages the prosecutor asked the prospective jurors where they believed sexual assaults occurred and instances they could think of where there would be no evidence of a sexual assault. Transcript of Trial (T.) 128-130. One prospective juror answered there may not be physical evidence if there had been a passage of time. T. 130. The prosecutor responded '[t]hat is something that is called delayed reporting.' He then asked if any of the prospective jurors were familiar with the term. T.131. Counsel for Appellant objected. At a side bar counsel for Appellant argued the prosecutor was'starting to put into play facts not in evidence and we're trying to condition the jury on the case facts.' T. 132. In response the prosecutor pointed out he had not referred to any victims and that whether or not jurors could accept the idea that sexual assault cases can be proven without physical evidence and whether they were open to the idea of delayed reporting was central to whether a potential juror in this matter could fairly weigh the evidence. T. 131. The trial court overruled Appellants objection but cautioned the prosecutor: '* * *make sure you stay really narrow with regard to this line of questioning.' T. 133. The prosecutor continued his voir dire and counsel for Appellant raised no further objection. T. 133-137. Appellant argues that after the trial court overruled his objection, the prosecutor went on to explain the science behind delayed reporting and polled jurors on the same. But the record simply does not support Appellant's allegations. Rather, the record reflects the prosecutor asked if jurors would immediately discount the testimony of a child who did not report their abuse right away and further asked if jurors would be willing to listen to an expert explain why there may not be physical signs of trauma as a result of sexual assault. T. 134-137. Upon review of the record, we find the state's questioning of the venire was narrowly tailored to determine whether any potential jurors harbored any bias which would make them ill-suited to determine this particular matter. Based on the circumstances of this case, the trial court's decision to overrule Appellant's objection was not error. We therefore reject Appellant's arguments pertaining to voir dire. Hearsay Appellant next argues the trial court erred in permitting hearsay testimony from J.M. the mother of V.1 and V.2. We disagree. The admission or exclusion of evidence rests in the sound discretion of the trial court. State v. Sage, 31 Ohio St.3d 173, 180, 510 N.E.2d 343 (1987). As a general rule, all relevant evidence is admissible. Evid.R. 402; cf. Evid.R. 802. We therefore review this issue for an abuse of discretion. Hearsay is 'a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.' Evid.R. 801(C). Appellant directs us to pages 425 and 426 of the transcript wherein the state was conducting direct examination of J.M., mother of the victims. The relevant portion reads: [The State]: Going back to August of 2017, do you remember a conversation you had with your daughter [V.1]? [J.M]: Yes [The State]: * * * And what was that conversation about? [Counsel for Appellant] Objection; hearsay Your Honor. [The State]: Your Honor, it goes to - - - [The Court]: Overruled. Go Ahead. [The State]: What was that conversation about? [J.M.]: She said [Appellant] raped and molested her. [The State]: All right. Based on that conversation what did you do? [J.M.]: I called the sheriff's department. Appellant further directs our attention to page 428 of the transcript. At this point the state's direct examination of J.M. focused on the fact she is a recovering drug addict and that her drug abuse had impacted her ability to properly parent her children: [The State]: Taking drugs, did that have an impact on your ability to be a good mother? [J.M]: Yes it did. [The State]: did you place yourself in front of your children? [J.M]: Do I? Yes. [The State]: Did you then? [J.M.]: No. [The State]: * * * Did you put yourself - - your needs in front of your children's needs? [J.M.]: Oh, yes. [The State]: And do you remember a time when [V.1] talked to you about something that was going on with [Appellant]? [Counsel for Appellant]: Objection, Your Honor. It's hearsay. * * * The Court: Stop. [Counsel for Appellant]: There's no foundation. The Court: Overruled. [The State]: Do you remember a time when you were on drugs [V.1.] talking to you about something going on with defendant? [J.M.]: I know she did. I don't remember the details. [The State]: Okay. Do you remember the nature of what she told you was going on? [J.M]: I remember she used the word rape. [The State]: Okay. Did you report it? [J.M.]: No. [The State]: Did you believe her? [J.M.]: No. [The State]: When you were told this time, what did you do? [J.M.]: I contacted law enforcement. [The State]: And did you make arrangements for your girls to go to Children's Hospital? [J.M.]: I did. {¶ 24} T. 427-429. {¶ 25} Appellee argues this testimony was not hearsay because it was not offered for the truth of the matter asserted. We agree. The Ohio Supreme Court has recognized that if a statement is not offered for the truth of the matter asserted, it is not prohibited by the hearsay rule and will be admissible, subject to the standards governing relevancy and undue prejudice. State v. LaMar, 95 Ohio St.3d 181, 196, 2002-Ohio-2128, 767 N.E.2d 166, citing State v. Maurer, 15 Ohio St.3d 239, 262-263, 473 N.E.2d 768 (1984). Thus \"'testimony which explains the actions of a witness to whom a statement was directed, such as to explain the witness' activities, is not hearsay.'\" Id., quoting Maurer at 262. Here, J.M.'s testimony in the first instance was limited to a single statement made by V.1 to explain why J.M. involved law enforcement. In the second instance J.M.'s testimony explained why she initially did nothing about the ongoing abuse. Each statement, therefore, was elicited to explain J.M's actions. In factually similar cases, such testimony was not hearsay. *State v. Hoseclaw*, 3d Dist. Allen No. 1-12-31, 2013-Ohio-3486 ¶ 48 (\"The trial court did not abuse its discretion by allowing the witness to testify concerning the victim’s statement that she was raped since it was offered not for its truth but to show why the witness reported the rape to the victim’s mother, which the mother, then, reported to law enforcement.\"). *State v. Dunn*, 9th Dist. No. 04CA008549, 2005-Ohio-1270, ¶ 17, *State v. Thomas*, 61 Ohio St.3d 223, 232, 400 N.E.2d 401 (1980) (\"It is well established that extrajudicial statements made by an out-of-court declarant are properly admissible to explain the actions of a witness to whom the statement was directed\"). Moreover, even if that were not true, J.M.’s testimony was cumulative to that of V.1 making its admission harmless error. T. 452-453, 458. '[t]he erroneous admission or exclusion of hearsay, cumulative to properly admitted testimony, constitutes harmless error.' *State v. Hogg*, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 11AP-50, 2011-Ohio-6454, ¶ 46. Appellant’s complaints regarding both voir dire and the admission of hearsay evidence are without merit. Since we do not find multiple instances of harmless error, the doctrine of cumulative error is inapplicable. The first assignment of error is overruled.\"\n}\n```"}

We disagree. Under the doctrine of cumulative error, '[s]eparately harmless errors may violate a defendant's right to a fair trial when the errors are considered together.' State v. Harris, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 19796, 2004-Ohio-3570, ¶ 40, citing State v. Madrigal, 87 Ohio St.3d 378, 397, 721 N.E.2d 52 (2000). 'In order to find cumulative error, we first must find that multiple errors were committed at trial.' Id. 'A conviction will be reversed when the cumulative effect of errors in a trial deprives a defendant of a fair trial even though each of the numerous instances of trial-court error does not individually constitute cause for reversal.' State v. Powell, 132 Ohio St.3d 233, 2012-Ohio-2577, 971 N.E.2d 865, ¶ 223, citing State v. DeMarco, 31 Ohio St.3d 191, 509 N.E.2d 1256 (1987), paragraph two of the syllabus. Voir Dire Appellant makes two arguments under this first assignment of error. In the first he argues the trial court improperly permitted the state to present factual elements of its case during voir dire over his counsel's objection. We disagree. Because the scope of voir dire lies within the sound discretion of the trial court, we review Appellant's argument for an abuse of discretion. State v. Jackson, 107 Ohio St.3d 53, 2005-Ohio-5981, 836 N.E.2d 1173, ¶ 28. In order to find an abuse of discretion, we must determine the trial court's decision was unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable and not merely an error of law or judgment. Blakemore v. Blakemore, 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 450 N.E.2d 1140 (1983). 'The scope of voir dire * * * varies depending on the circumstances of each case.' State v. Bedford, 39 Ohio St.3d 122, 129, 529 N.E.2d 913 (1988). A prosecutor has a right to give an overview of the facts of the case and of those involved in order to ascertain whether prospective jurors know anything about the offense. State v. Tyler, 50 Ohio St.3d 24, 32, 553 N.E.2d 576 (1990). While jurors must be impartial, they need not be completely ignorant of the facts and issues involved in a case to be qualified as jurors. State v. Gross, 97 Ohio St.3d 121, 2002-Ohio-5524, 776 N.E.2d 1061, ¶ 38. 'The purpose of voir dire is not to establish how a juror will vote on the case to be tried; it is to discover whether any juror has a bias that would prevent him or her from individually weighing the facts of the case.' State v. Madison, 160 Ohio St.3d 232, 2020-Ohio-3735, 155 N.E.3d 867, ¶ 24. In support of his argument that the trial court erred in permitting the state to present factual evidence of its case during voir dire over his counsel's objection, Appellant directs us to pages 128-137 of the transcript. Within these pages the prosecutor asked the prospective jurors where they believed sexual assaults occurred and instances they could think of where there would be no evidence of a sexual assault. Transcript of Trial (T.) 128-130. One prospective juror answered there may not be physical evidence if there had been a passage of time. T. 130. The prosecutor responded '[t]hat is something that is called delayed reporting.' He then asked if any of the prospective jurors were familiar with the term. T.131. Counsel for Appellant objected. At a side bar counsel for Appellant argued the prosecutor was'starting to put into play facts not in evidence and we're trying to condition the jury on the case facts.' T. 132. In response the prosecutor pointed out he had not referred to any victims and that whether or not jurors could accept the idea that sexual assault cases can be proven without physical evidence and whether they were open to the idea of delayed reporting was central to whether a potential juror in this matter could fairly weigh the evidence. T. 131. The trial court overruled Appellants objection but cautioned the prosecutor: '* * *make sure you stay really narrow with regard to this line of questioning.' T. 133. The prosecutor continued his voir dire and counsel for Appellant raised no further objection. T. 133-137. Appellant argues that after the trial court overruled his objection, the prosecutor went on to explain the science behind delayed reporting and polled jurors on the same. But the record simply does not support Appellant's allegations. Rather, the record reflects the prosecutor asked if jurors would immediately discount the testimony of a child who did not report their abuse right away and further asked if jurors would be willing to listen to an expert explain why there may not be physical signs of trauma as a result of sexual assault. T. 134-137. Upon review of the record, we find the state's questioning of the venire was narrowly tailored to determine whether any potential jurors harbored any bias which would make them ill-suited to determine this particular matter. Based on the circumstances of this case, the trial court's decision to overrule Appellant's objection was not error. We therefore reject Appellant's arguments pertaining to voir dire. Hearsay Appellant next argues the trial court erred in permitting hearsay testimony from J.M. the mother of V.1 and V.2. We disagree. The admission or exclusion of evidence rests in the sound discretion of the trial court. State v. Sage, 31 Ohio St.3d 173, 180, 510 N.E.2d 343 (1987). As a general rule, all relevant evidence is admissible. Evid.R. 402; cf. Evid.R. 802. We therefore review this issue for an abuse of discretion. Hearsay is 'a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.' Evid.R. 801(C). Appellant directs us to pages 425 and 426 of the transcript wherein the state was conducting direct examination of J.M., mother of the victims. The relevant portion reads: [The State]: Going back to August of 2017, do you remember a conversation you had with your daughter [V.1]?

Under his First Assignment of Error, Thomas contends his conviction for two counts of rape of a person under 13 years of age and four counts of gross sexual imposition of a person under 13 years of age was against the manifest weight of the evidence. In support of this claim, Thomas argues there was no physical evidence of the offenses and that his conviction was based solely on the testimony of T.K., who was not a credible witness. Thomas claims that T.K. was not a credible witness because she suffered from mental and emotional impairment; specifically, T.K. heard voices and took psychotropic medicine for daily functioning. We find no merit to Thomas’s argument. ‘A weight of the evidence argument challenges the believability of the evidence and asks which of the competing inferences suggested by the evidence is more believable or persuasive.’ (Citation omitted.) State v. Wilson, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 22581, 2009-Ohio-525, ¶ 12. When evaluating whether a conviction is against the manifest weight of the evidence, the appellate court must review the entire record, weigh the evidence and all reasonable inferences, consider witness credibility, and determine whether, in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the trier of fact ‘clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered.’” State v. Thompkins, 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 387, 678 N.E.2d 541 (1997), quoting State v. Martin, 20 Ohio App.3d 172, 175, 485 N.E.2d 717 (1st Dist.1983). A judgment should be reversed as being against the manifest weight of the evidence ‘only in the exceptional case in which the evidence weighs heavily against the conviction.’ (Citations omitted.) Martin at 175. The credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be given to their testimony are matters for the trier of fact to resolve. State v. Hammad, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 26057, 2014-Ohio-3638, ¶ 13, citing State v. DeHass, 10 Ohio St.2d 230, 231, 227 N.E.2d 212 (1967). Because the trier of fact sees and hears the witnesses at trial, we must defer to the factfinder’s decisions whether, and to what extent, to credit the testimony of particular witnesses. State v. Lawson, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 16288, 1997 WL 476684, *4 (Aug. 22, 1997). ‘This court will not substitute its judgment for that of the trier of fact on the issue of witness credibility unless it is patently apparent that the trier of fact lost its way.’ State v. Bradley, 2d Dist. Champaign No. 97 CA 03, 1997 WL 691510, *4 (Oct. 24, 1997). In this case, Thomas does not dispute that T.K. sufficiently testified regarding each incident of sexual abuse for which he was convicted. Instead, Thomas claims the weight of the evidence did not support his conviction because there was no physical evidence of the abuse and because T.K.’s testimony lacked credibility due to her suffering from mental and emotional impairment. With regard to physical evidence, it is well established that physical evidence is not required to support a conviction for rape or gross sexual imposition against a manifest weight challenge. State v. West, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 06AP-11, 2006-Ohio-6259, ¶ 18; State v. Thomas, 2015-Ohio-5247, 54 N.E.3d 732, ¶ 31 (9th Dist.); State v. White, 3d Dist.

Accordingly, the fact that Thomas’s conviction was based solely on T.K.’s testimony and not any physical evidence did not render his conviction against the manifest weight of the evidence. In addition, the fact that the jury chose to believe T.K.’s testimony despite her mental illness did not render Thomas’s conviction against the manifest weight of the evidence. Simply stated, ‘the jury was free to believe, or disbelieve, any part of the witnesses’ testimony, and a conviction is not against the manifest weight of the evidence merely because the jury believed the prosecution’s testimony.’ (Citation omitted.) State v. Arega, 2012-Ohio-5774, 983 N.E.2d 863, ¶ 30 (10th Dist.). Here, the jury heard evidence concerning the mental and emotional issues for which T.K. was being medicated and chose to find T.K. credible despite those issues. With regard to hearing voices, T.K. specifically testified that the voices she heard did not tell her to say that Thomas abused her. T.K.’s medical providers, Dr. Vavul-Roediger and Melinda Kiser, as well as T.K.’s counselor, Danielle Baker, also testified that T.K. never indicated the voices she heard told her she was sexually abused by Thomas. Kiser, who diagnosed T.K. with severe major depressive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, general anxiety disorder, and gender dysphoria also testified that T.K. was able to accurately convey things that have happened to her. Dr. Vavul-Roediger further testified that T.K. appeared to be in touch with reality when she examined T.K. following her disclosure of the sexual abuse. When considering the testimony of record, we do not find the jury clearly lost its way and created a manifest miscarriage of justice by believing T.K.’s testimony regarding the sexual abuse, as the jury was in the best position to weigh T.K.’s credibility.\"\n}\n```"}

Montgomery No. 16288, 1997 WL 476684, *4 (Aug. 22, 1997). ‘This court will not substitute its judgment for that of the trier of fact on the issue of witness credibility unless it is patently apparent that the trier of fact lost its way.’ State v. Bradley, 2d Dist. Champaign No. 97 CA 03, 1997 WL 691510, *4 (Oct. 24, 1997). In this case, Thomas does not dispute that T.K. sufficiently testified regarding each incident of sexual abuse for which he was convicted. Instead, Thomas claims the weight of the evidence did not support his conviction because there was no physical evidence of the abuse and because T.K.’s testimony lacked credibility due to her suffering from mental and emotional impairment. With regard to physical evidence, it is well established that physical evidence is not required to support a conviction for rape or gross sexual imposition against a manifest weight challenge. State v. West, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 06AP-11, 2006-Ohio-6259, ¶ 18; State v. Thomas, 2015-Ohio-5247, 54 N.E.3d 732, ¶ 31 (9th Dist.); State v. White, 3d Dist. Seneca No. 13-16-21, 2017-Ohio-1488, ¶ 54; State v. Williams, 2017-Ohio-8898, 101 N.E.3d 547, ¶ 19 (1st Dist.). Accordingly, the fact that Thomas’s conviction was based solely on T.K.’s testimony and not any physical evidence did not render his conviction against the manifest weight of the evidence. In addition, the fact that the jury chose to believe T.K.’s testimony despite her mental illness did not render Thomas’s conviction against the manifest weight of the evidence. Simply stated, ‘the jury was free to believe, or disbelieve, any part of the witnesses’ testimony, and a conviction is not against the manifest weight of the evidence merely because the jury believed the prosecution’s testimony.’ (Citation omitted.) State v. Arega, 2012-Ohio-5774, 983 N.E.2d 863, ¶ 30 (10th Dist.). Here, the jury heard evidence concerning the mental and emotional issues for which T.K. was being medicated and chose to find T.K. credible despite those issues. With regard to hearing voices, T.K. specifically testified that the voices she heard did not tell her to say that Thomas abused her. T.K.’s medical providers, Dr. Vavul-Roediger and Melinda Kiser, as well as T.K.’s counselor, Danielle Baker, also testified that T.K. never indicated the voices she heard told her she was sexually abused by Thomas. Kiser, who diagnosed T.K. with severe major depressive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, general anxiety disorder, and gender dysphoria also testified that T.K. was able to accurately convey things that have happened to her. Dr. Vavul-Roediger further testified that T.K. appeared to be in touch with reality when she examined T.K. following her disclosure of the sexual abuse. When considering the testimony of record, we do not find the jury clearly lost its way and created a manifest miscarriage of justice by believing T.K.’s testimony regarding the sexual abuse, as the jury was in the best position to weigh T.K.’s credibility.\"\n}\n```"}

Although Sipple raised multiple arguments in his motion to suppress, on appeal he only argues that any statements made during the December 2016 incident were not relevant to his prosecution for unauthorized use, or that the probative value of such evidence was outweighed by the risk of undue prejudice. Appellate review of a motion to suppress presents a mixed question of law and fact. An appellate court must accept the trial court's findings of fact if they are supported by competent, credible evidence. 'Accepting these facts as true, the appellate court must then independently determine, without deference to the conclusion of the trial court, whether the facts satisfy the applicable legal standard.' Sipple argues any statements to Officer Stock during the December 2016 incident were not relevant to his prosecution for unauthorized use of a computer. Generally, relevant evidence is admissible, except where excluded by the federal or state constitutions, statute, or rule. Relevant evidence is 'evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.' Sipple was charged with unauthorized use of a computer, in violation of R.C. 2913.04. As relevant to this case, that statute prohibits knowingly gaining access to a computer or computer system without the consent of the owner of the computer or computer system. Officer Stock testified Sipple stated he deleted records from the slate room computer and was intoxicated when he did it. If true, this statement would constitute an admission of having accessed the slate room computer, which is a fact of consequence to determining whether Sipple committed the charged offense. Thus, evidence regarding Sipple's statements during the December 2016 incident was relevant to the present case. Sipple further argues that even if the statements were relevant, they should have been suppressed due to the risk of undue prejudice. Relevant evidence 'is not admissible if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, of confusion of the issues, or of misleading the jury.' Sipple appears to argue there was a risk of undue prejudice because the statements were alleged to have been made while he was in a police cruiser. Exclusion of relevant evidence due to undue prejudice involves more than mere prejudice, because anything adverse to a party's case could be deemed prejudicial to that party. 'Unfair prejudice is that quality of evidence which might result in an improper basis for a jury decision. Consequently, if the evidence arouses the jury's emotional sympathies, evokes a sense of horror, or appeals to an instinct to punish, the evidence may be unfairly prejudicial.' A review of the trial transcript indicates Officer Stock did not testify on direct examination that Sipple's statements during the December 2016 incident occurred while Sipple was in a police cruiser. To the extent the jury became aware that this conversation occurred while Sipple was in a police cruiser, that fact was raised by Sipple's trial counsel in the course of cross-examining Officer Stock in impeaching his credibility based on the fact that no recording of the conversation from the cruiser's dash camera was preserved. Moreover, there was no testimony suggesting to the jury that Sipple was arrested or charged with any crime as a result of the December 2016 incident. Under these circumstances, we cannot conclude this was the type of evidence that would arouse the jury's sympathies, evoke a sense of horror, or appeal to the jury's instinct to punish Sipple, and the trial court did not err by failing to exclude the evidence based on the risk of undue prejudice.\"\n}\n```"}

An error not raised in the trial court must be plain error for an appellate court to reverse. State v. Long, 53 Ohio St.2d 91, 372 N.E.2d 804 (1978) at paragraph one of the syllabus; Crim.R. 52(B).

Id. at paragraph two of the syllabus. Notice of plain error “is to be taken with the utmost caution, under exceptional circumstances and only to prevent a manifest miscarriage of justice.” Id. at paragraph three of the syllabus. The test for prosecutorial misconduct is whether the prosecutor’s remarks and comments were improper and if so, whether those remarks and comments prejudicially affected the substantial rights of the accused.

The trial court immediately stopped the questioning and instructed the jury to disregard that statement. ¶17 During the prosecutions closing arguments the prosecution recited the statute which made reference to the level of offense being a felony in the second degree. No objection was made at this point during closing arguments. ¶18 Appellant also argues that the prosecutor’s closing arguments contained allegations of other criminal misconduct not charged; Intimidation of attorney, victim or witness. During closing arguments the prosecution, summarizing testimony, noted Ludt, the confidential informant, was placed in jail right next to Appellant. The prosecution then asked the jury to use their common sense as to why Ludt changed his testimony, stating, “Ladies and gentlemen, use your reason and your common sense; it’s clear to see he made a deal with Jimmy Ludt.” Tr. II at 62. Upon review and with regard to the statements made in reference to Ludt changing his testimony, we find the State was merely asking the jury to evaluate the credibility of Ludt, consider all the testimony, and use their common sense. In the challenged references to the level of the offense, while the references to the level of the offense were improper, the judge properly instructed the jury to disregard during Detective Rajcan’s testimony. Appellant has not shown that the references made during closing arguments, while improper, deprived Appellant of a fair trial based on the entire record. Moreover, Appellant has not demonstrated, even assuming arguendo the prosecutors conduct did deprive Appellant of a fair trial, that “but for” these isolated statements, he would not have been convicted of the crimes.

We disagree. As Appellant did not lodge an objection to the error he currently raises, he has therefore waived all but plain error. An error not raised in the trial court must be plain error for an appellate court to reverse. State v. Long, 53 Ohio St.2d 91, 372 N.E.2d 804 (1978) at paragraph one of the syllabus; Crim.R. 52(B). To prevail under a plain error analysis, appellant bears the burden of demonstrating that the outcome of the trial clearly would have been different but for the error. Id. at paragraph two of the syllabus. Notice of plain error “is to be taken with the utmost caution, under exceptional circumstances and only to prevent a manifest miscarriage of justice.” Id. at paragraph three of the syllabus. The test for prosecutorial misconduct is whether the prosecutor’s remarks and comments were improper and if so, whether those remarks and comments prejudicially affected the substantial rights of the accused. State v. Lott, 51 Ohio St.3d 160, 555 N.E.2d 293 (1990), cert denied, 498 U.S. 1017, 111 S.Ct. 591, 112 L.Ed.2d 596 (1990). In reviewing allegations of prosecutorial misconduct, we must review the complained-of conduct in the context of the entire trial. Darden v. Wainwright, 477 U.S. 168, 106 S.Ct. 2464, 91 L.Ed.2d 144 (1986). Prosecutorial misconduct will not provide a basis for reversal unless the misconduct can be said to have deprived Appellant of a fair trial based on the entire record. Lott, supra, 51 Ohio St.3d at 166, 555 N.E.2d 293. A prosecutor’s remarks constitute misconduct if remarks were improper and if the remarks prejudicially affected an accused’s substantial rights. State v. Williams, 99 Ohio St.3d 439, 793 N.E.2d 446, 2003-Ohio-4164. Prosecutorial misconduct will not provide a basis for reversal unless the misconduct can be said to have deprived the Appellant of a fair trial based on the entire record. State v. Lott, 51 Ohio St.3d 160, 555 N.E.2d 293 (1990). The analysis does not include the culpability of the prosecutor, but the fairness of the trial. *State v. Gapen*, 104 Ohio St.3d 358, 819 N.E.2d 1047, 2004-Ohio-6548. The record must be viewed in its entirety to determine whether the allegedly improper remarks were prejudicial. *State v. Treesh* (2001), 90 Ohio St.3d 460, 739 N.E.2d 749. ¶15 Appellant argues that statements made by the prosecutor during closing arguments and the testimony of Detective Rajcan referencing the level of offense were improper. ¶16 During Detective Rajcan’s testimony describing why it mattered if the drugs were sold in a bulk amount, he mentioned the level of offense as being a felony two. The trial court immediately stopped the questioning and instructed the jury to disregard that statement. ¶17 During the prosecutions closing arguments the prosecution recited the statute which made reference to the level of offense being a felony in the second degree. No objection was made at this point during closing arguments. ¶18 Appellant also argues that the prosecutor’s closing arguments contained allegations of other criminal misconduct not charged; Intimidation of attorney, victim or witness.

Dowell then testified that Vicario told her the following day that he messed up and ‘shot those people.’ Matthews testified that she showed Vicario where to find the people from the fight at the convenience store. Then approximately ten minutes later, Vicario left Dowell’s home. (Tr. 410-412.)

We disagree. An appellate court reviewing a trial court’s decision on a motion for mistrial defers to the judgment of the trial court, as it is in the best position to determine whether circumstances warrant a mistrial. State v. Glover, 35 Ohio St.3d 18, 19 (1988). Accordingly, we review a trial court’s decision on a motion for mistrial for an abuse of discretion. Columbus v. Aleshire, 187 Ohio App.3d 660, 2010-Ohio-2773, ¶ 42 (10th Dist.), citing State v. Sage, 31 Ohio St.3d 173, 182 (1987). The term abuse of discretion implies that the court’s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. State v. Adams, 62 Ohio St.2d 151, 157 (1980). An abuse of discretion involves views or actions 'that no conscientious judge, acting intelligently, could honestly have taken.' State v. Hancock, 108 Ohio St.3d 57, 2006-Ohio-160, ¶ 130, quoting State ex rel. Wilms v. Blake, 144 Ohio St. 619, 624 (1945). 'A mistrial should not be ordered in a criminal case merely because some error or irregularity has intervened, unless the substantial rights of the accused or the prosecution are adversely affected.' State v. Walburg, 10th Dist. No. 10AP-1087, 2011-Ohio-4762, ¶ 52, quoting State v. Reynolds, 49 Ohio App.3d 27, 33 (2d Dist.1988). Rather, a trial court should only declare a mistrial when 'the ends of justice so require and a fair trial is no longer possible.' State v. Franklin, 62 Ohio St.3d 118, 127 (1991). In determining whether a criminal defendant was deprived of a fair trial, an appellate court must determine whether, absent the error or irregularity, 'the jury would have found the [defendant] guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.' Aleshire at ¶ 42, citing State v. Maurer, 15 Ohio St.3d 239, 267 (1984). As noted above, in this case, counsel for appellant moved for a mistrial based on prosecutorial misconduct during closing argument. In the context of closing arguments, the test for prosecutorial misconduct is 'whether 'the remarks were improper and, if so, whether they prejudicially affected substantial rights of the defendant.''State v. Fudge, 10th Dist. No. 16AP-821, 2018-Ohio-601, ¶ 48, quoting State v. Smith, 14 Ohio St.3d 13, 14 (1984). In determining whether allegedly improper remarks resulted in prejudice to the defendant, a reviewing court must consider '(1) the nature of the remarks, (2) whether an objection was made by counsel, (3) whether corrective instructions were given by the court, and (4) the strength of the evidence against the defendant.' (Further quotations and citations omitted.) Id. at ¶ 47, quoting Aleshire at ¶ 42. Furthermore, because isolated instances of prosecutorial misconduct are deemed harmless, 'the closing argument must be viewed in its entirety to determine whether the defendant has been prejudiced.' Id. at ¶ 48, quoting State v. Muhleka, 2d Dist. No. 19827, 2004-Ohio-1822, at ¶ 85, quoting State v. Stevens, 2d Dist. No. 19572, 2003-Ohio-6249, ¶ 34. 'Prosecutors are entitled to considerable latitude in closing argument.' Fudge at ¶ 48, quoting Muhleka at ¶ 85, citing State v. Ballew, 76 Ohio St.3d 244, 255 (1996). During closing argument, the prosecutor is free to comment on 'what the evidence has shown and what reasonable inferences may be drawn therefrom.' (Further citations omitted.) Id., quoting Muhleka at ¶ 85, citing State v. Lott, 51 Ohio St.3d 160, 165 (1990). The prosecutor is likewise free to'state his or her opinion if it is based on the evidence presented at trial.' State v. Diar, 120 Ohio St.3d 460, 2008-Ohio-6266, ¶ 213. Furthermore, where a defendant has failed 'to object to the prosecutor's alleged misconduct, he waives all but plain error.' Fudge at ¶ 49, quoting Wellston v. Horsley, 4th Dist. No. 05CA18, 2006-Ohio-4386, ¶ 22, citing Crim.R. 52; State v. Hartman, 93 Ohio St.3d 274, 294 (2001). Notice of plain error under Crim.R. 52(B) 'is to be taken with the utmost of caution, under exceptional circumstances and only to prevent a manifest miscarriage of justice.' Id., quoting Wellston at ¶ 22. Furthermore, 'plain error should not be invoked unless it can be said that, but for the error, the outcome of the trial would clearly have been otherwise.' Id., quoting Wellston at ¶ 22. Moreover, where the trial court has instructed the jury the evidence did not include opening statements or closing arguments of counsel or any other statement made by counsel during trial, and that 'opening statements and closing arguments are designed to assist you but they are not evidence,' it is presumed that 'the jurors followed these instructions and that the verdict was not, therefore, based on the content of the closing arguments.' Fudge at ¶ 52, citing State v. Thompson, 3d Dist. No. 7-16-10, 2017-Ohio-792, ¶ 26, citing Pang v. Minch, 53 Ohio St.3d 186, 187 (1990). In this case, as noted previously, after the jury had retired to commence deliberations, defense counsel moved for a mistrial based on the prosecutor's alleged misconduct during closing arguments. Defense counsel specifically averred: 'Your Honor, I try to be restrained during closing arguments, but particularly when counsel in rebuttal makes statements, it becomes even more difficult. But I would note my objection and even move for a mistrial based upon comments that were made on rebuttal. First of all, one comment was made to the jurors that they, too, should be outraged. And that was made in response to or during her explanation about the community standards. But that's an invitation for this jury to decide this case based upon emotion and not the facts or the law in this case, which specifically they are told not to do. Another objection I have is several times in her argument she stated that it doesn't matter that Hanna injected herself. Well, so she is asking the jury to again ignore the evidence. The jurors' responsibility is to consider all of the evidence and the fact that that particular comment or the other point of my presentation that it is not in the jury instructions is still relevant to their deliberations, both in terms of evaluating the evidence and specifically in weighing whether or not the death was the proximate cause of my client's conduct versus that of Hanna's conduct. So for those reasons, we make our objections and we would make our motion.' (Tr. at 451-52.) After listening to arguments from both the prosecutor and defense counsel, the trial court denied the motion for a mistrial, stating: 'I instructed the jury prior to taking evidence and during my instructions that closing statements of counsel are not evidence and should not be considered by them as evidence. I will deny your motion for a mistrial. I will note your objection.' (Tr. at 453.) A review of the record reveals that during rebuttal closing arguments, the prosecutor stated to the jury, '[d]isturbing photographs, I hope they are disturbing to you. They should be disturbing to you. They should be disturbing and y'all should be outraged.' (Tr. at 436.) Defense counsel did not object to the foregoing remarks at the time they were made. The prosecutor also stated to the jury, '[t]he Judge has given you all of the law on these jury instructions. Right? That is the law that you've got to follow. And not one place in here will you find if Hanna Geiger, the victim, injected herself or because she wanted the drugs, that that means he is not culpable. You won't find that in here.' (Tr. at 439.) Defense counsel lodged a general objection to the foregoing statement, but the objection was overruled by the trial court. (Tr. at 439.) The prosecutor continued rebuttal closing arguments and informed the jury, '[a]gain, I never once said that she didn't inject herself. And you know, it doesn't matter. At the end of the day it doesn't matter if she injected it, smoked it, ate it. He still provided that cocaine to her.' (Tr. at 443.) Defense counsel made no objection to the foregoing remarks at the time the prosecutor made them. The prosecutor also stated to the jury, '[y]ou are here to judge the facts and determine whether the State has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant, Andrew Nichols -- not Hanna Geiger. She's not on trial here. She is the victim in this case.' (Tr. at 444.) Defense counsel objected to the prosecutor's use of the word 'victim,' but the objection was overruled by the trial court. (Tr. at 444.) Continuing rebuttal closing argument, the prosecutor informed the jury, '[y]ou have to decide this case. You follow the law, and it is did we prove our case beyond a reasonable doubt. I submit to you we did. And now he just wants to blame the victim, Hanna.' (Tr. at 446.) Defense counsel again objected to the use of the word 'victim' by the prosecutor, but the objection was overruled by the trial court. (Tr. at 446-47.) Upon consideration, we find the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to grant appellant's motion for mistrial premised on the foregoing remarks made by the prosecutor during rebuttal closing argument. First, regarding appellant's contention that the prosecutor improperly invited the jury to decide the case based on emotion rather than the facts of the case or the applicable law by stating to the jurors that they should be 'outraged' by what they saw in the photographs presented at trial, we reiterate that defense counsel made no objection to this remark at the time it was made. Accordingly, he has waived all but plain error on this point. Fudge at ¶ 49. Furthermore, we find no improper conduct on the part of the prosecutor in commenting that the jurors should be outraged in viewing the photographs of Hanna's body. This is so, because 'outrage' is an element of the offense of gross abuse of a corpse,7 one of the counts with which appellant had been charged. When this comment is viewed in context with the indictment, the jury instructions, and the prosecutor's earlier closing argument on this point (Tr. at 409-11), it is apparent that the comment was meant to reference the element of outrage included in the offense. (Tr. at 409-11.) As the prosecutor had to prove this element, it was not improper to urge the jury that they should be outraged by the photographs they viewed because the photographs were direct evidence of the treatment of Hanna Geiger's body by appellant. Put another way, this remark by the prosecutor was an entirely fair one because it was based on 'what the evidence has shown and what reasonable inferences may be drawn therefrom.' (Further citations omitted.) Fudge at ¶ 48, quoting Muhleka at ¶ 85, quoting Lott at 165. The jurors would have understood the prosecutor's comment in this context and they would not have taken the prosecutor's comment to be an invitation to abandon their responsibility to decide the case based on the law and the facts and instead improperly decide the case based on emotion. There was no misconduct on the part of the prosecutor in urging the jurors to be outraged by the photographs of Hanna's body, and there was no error, plain or otherwise, on the part of the trial court in denying the motion for mistrial on this basis. Next, we turn to appellant's complaint that the prosecutor improperly used the word 'victim' to describe Hanna Geiger three times during rebuttal closing argument. As set forth above, defense counsel lodged an objection each time the prosecutor referred to Hanna Geiger as a victim, and the trial court overruled each objection. In support of appellant's argument that the prosecutor's use of the term 'victim' during closing argument substantially affected the jurors' impartiality in evaluating the evidence to the prejudice of appellant, he cites to State v. Almedom, 10th Dist. No. 15AP-852, 2016-Ohio-1553, in which this court determined, sua sponte, that defense counsel in that case had been ineffective by failing to object to repeated references made by the trial judge to the child witnesses as 'victims.' We find Almedom readily distinguishable from the instant matter. First and foremost, in Almedom, the offending references to the witnesses as 'victims' were made by the trial judge, not the prosecutor. While a trial judge must remain detached and neutral in any matter before the court, the prosecutor is not constrained by any such obligation of neutrality. State v. Harper, 10th Dist. No. 01-AP-201, 2001-Ohio-8875. Secondly, in Almedom, the improper references were made throughout the entire trial. Here, the prosecutor's references to Hanna Geiger as a 'victim' were made only during rebuttal closing argument. As discussed above, during closing argument, the prosecutor is free to comment on 'what the evidence has shown and what reasonable inferences may be drawn therefrom.' (Internal quotations and citations omitted.) Fudge at ¶ 48. In our view, the prosecutor's references to Hanna Geiger as a 'victim' entailed fair comment on what the evidence had shown and were not improper. Thus, there was no misconduct on the part of the prosecutor in referring to Hanna Geiger as a victim, and there was no error on the part of the trial court in denying the motion for mistrial on this basis. Finally, we address appellant's contention that, in referencing the court's instructions to the jury, the prosecutor improperly asked the jury to disregard evidence by stating it did not matter that Hanna Geiger injected herself with the cocaine for purposes of determining whether appellant was culpable in Hanna's death. We reiterate that defense counsel made no objection to this remark at the time it was made. Accordingly, he has waived all but plain error on this issue. *Fudge* at ¶ 49. Furthermore, we do not agree that the prosecutor engaged in misconduct by asserting that for purposes of determining appellant’s culpability in Hanna Geiger’s death, whether Hanna injected the narcotics herself was of no import. Instead, we find the prosecutor was appropriately arguing the legal insignificance of this evidence as it pertained to the jury’s consideration of the involuntary manslaughter charge. This is so because pursuant to the court’s instructions, appellant was culpable in Hanna’s death if the jury found that appellant provided Hanna with the cocaine. Put another way, the fact that Hanna injected herself would not negate appellant’s culpability. Indeed, the prosecutor conceded that Hanna injected herself in explaining why this fact did not negate appellant’s culpability or provide a legal defense to the charge of involuntary manslaughter. (Tr. at 439, 443.) In short, Hanna’s act of self-injection 'would not change the basic fact that the victim took the drugs furnished by [the defendant] and died as a result.' *State v. Price*, 8th Dist. No. 107096, 2019-Ohio-1642, ¶ 89. The prosecutor did not improperly tell the jury that it did not matter if Hanna injected herself, and there was no error, plain or otherwise, on the part of the trial court in denying the motion for mistrial on this basis. Moreover, in considering all of appellants’ assertions of alleged prosecutorial misconduct during rebuttal closing argument, we observe the trial court instructed the jury 'the evidence does not include the indictment or opening statements or closing arguments of counsel. The opening statements and closing arguments of counsel are designed to assist you. They are not evidence.' (Jury Instr. at 2.) Thus, we presume that the jurors followed these instructions and the verdict was not based on the content of the closing arguments. *Fudge* at ¶ 52, citing at ¶ 26, citing *Pang* at 187. In short, appellant has failed to establish any prosecutorial misconduct during closing arguments which resulted in appellant being deprived of a fair trial. Therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellant’s motion for mistrial based on alleged prosecutorial misconduct, and appellant’s first assignment of error is overruled.\"\n}\n```"}

State v. Glover, 35 Ohio St.3d 18, 19 (1988). Accordingly, we review a trial court’s decision on a motion for mistrial for an abuse of discretion. Columbus v.

The term abuse of discretion implies that the court’s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. State v. Adams, 62 Ohio St.2d 151, 157 (1980). An abuse of discretion involves views or actions 'that no conscientious judge, acting intelligently, could honestly have taken.' State v. Hancock, 108 Ohio St.3d 57, 2006-Ohio-160, ¶ 130, quoting State ex rel. Wilms v. Blake, 144 Ohio St. 619, 624 (1945). 'A mistrial should not be ordered in a criminal case merely because some error or irregularity has intervened, unless the substantial rights of the accused or the prosecution are adversely affected.' State v. Walburg, 10th Dist. No. 10AP-1087, 2011-Ohio-4762, ¶ 52, quoting State v. Reynolds, 49 Ohio App.3d 27, 33 (2d Dist.1988). Rather, a trial court should only declare a mistrial when 'the ends of justice so require and a fair trial is no longer possible.' State v. Franklin, 62 Ohio St.3d 118, 127 (1991). In determining whether a criminal defendant was deprived of a fair trial, an appellate court must determine whether, absent the error or irregularity, 'the jury would have found the [defendant] guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.' Aleshire at ¶ 42, citing State v. Maurer, 15 Ohio St.3d 239, 267 (1984). As noted above, in this case, counsel for appellant moved for a mistrial based on prosecutorial misconduct during closing argument. In the context of closing arguments, the test for prosecutorial misconduct is 'whether 'the remarks were improper and, if so, whether they prejudicially affected substantial rights of the defendant.''State v. Fudge, 10th Dist. No. 16AP-821, 2018-Ohio-601, ¶ 48, quoting State v. Smith, 14 Ohio St.3d 13, 14 (1984). In determining whether allegedly improper remarks resulted in prejudice to the defendant, a reviewing court must consider '(1) the nature of the remarks, (2) whether an objection was made by counsel, (3) whether corrective instructions were given by the court, and (4) the strength of the evidence against the defendant.' (Further quotations and citations omitted.) Id. at ¶ 47, quoting Aleshire at ¶ 42. Furthermore, because isolated instances of prosecutorial misconduct are deemed harmless, 'the closing argument must be viewed in its entirety to determine whether the defendant has been prejudiced.' Id. at ¶ 48, quoting State v. Muhleka, 2d Dist. No. 19827, 2004-Ohio-1822, at ¶ 85, quoting State v. Stevens, 2d Dist. No. 19572, 2003-Ohio-6249, ¶ 34. 'Prosecutors are entitled to considerable latitude in closing argument.' Fudge at ¶ 48, quoting Muhleka at ¶ 85, citing State v. Ballew, 76 Ohio St.3d 244, 255 (1996). During closing argument, the prosecutor is free to comment on 'what the evidence has shown and what reasonable inferences may be drawn therefrom.' (Further citations omitted.) Id., quoting Muhleka at ¶ 85, citing State v. Lott, 51 Ohio St.3d 160, 165 (1990). The prosecutor is likewise free to'state his or her opinion if it is based on the evidence presented at trial.' State v. Diar, 120 Ohio St.3d 460, 2008-Ohio-6266, ¶ 213. Furthermore, where a defendant has failed 'to object to the prosecutor's alleged misconduct, he waives all but plain error.' Fudge at ¶ 49, quoting Wellston v. Horsley, 4th Dist. No. 05CA18, 2006-Ohio-4386, ¶ 22, citing Crim.R. 52; State v. Hartman, 93 Ohio St.3d 274, 294 (2001).

Id., quoting Wellston at ¶ 22. Furthermore, 'plain error should not be invoked unless it can be said that, but for the error, the outcome of the trial would clearly have been otherwise.' Id., quoting Wellston at ¶ 22. Moreover, where the trial court has instructed the jury the evidence did not include opening statements or closing arguments of counsel or any other statement made by counsel during trial, and that 'opening statements and closing arguments are designed to assist you but they are not evidence,' it is presumed that 'the jurors followed these instructions and that the verdict was not, therefore, based on the content of the closing arguments.'

In this case, as noted previously, after the jury had retired to commence deliberations, defense counsel moved for a mistrial based on the prosecutor's alleged misconduct during closing arguments. Defense counsel specifically averred: 'Your Honor, I try to be restrained during closing arguments, but particularly when counsel in rebuttal makes statements, it becomes even more difficult. But I would note my objection and even move for a mistrial based upon comments that were made on rebuttal. First of all, one comment was made to the jurors that they, too, should be outraged. And that was made in response to or during her explanation about the community standards. But that's an invitation for this jury to decide this case based upon emotion and not the facts or the law in this case, which specifically they are told not to do. Another objection I have is several times in her argument she stated that it doesn't matter that Hanna injected herself. Well, so she is asking the jury to again ignore the evidence. The jurors' responsibility is to consider all of the evidence and the fact that that particular comment or the other point of my presentation that it is not in the jury instructions is still relevant to their deliberations, both in terms of evaluating the evidence and specifically in weighing whether or not the death was the proximate cause of my client's conduct versus that of Hanna's conduct.

But I would note my objection and even move for a mistrial based upon comments that were made on rebuttal. First of all, one comment was made to the jurors that they, too, should be outraged. And that was made in response to or during her explanation about the community standards. But that's an invitation for this jury to decide this case based upon emotion and not the facts or the law in this case, which specifically they are told not to do. Another objection I have is several times in her argument she stated that it doesn't matter that Hanna injected herself. Well, so she is asking the jury to again ignore the evidence. The jurors' responsibility is to consider all of the evidence and the fact that that particular comment or the other point of my presentation that it is not in the jury instructions is still relevant to their deliberations, both in terms of evaluating the evidence and specifically in weighing whether or not the death was the proximate cause of my client's conduct versus that of Hanna's conduct. So for those reasons, we make our objections and we would make our motion.' (Tr. at 451-52.) After listening to arguments from both the prosecutor and defense counsel, the trial court denied the motion for a mistrial, stating: 'I instructed the jury prior to taking evidence and during my instructions that closing statements of counsel are not evidence and should not be considered by them as evidence. I will deny your motion for a mistrial. I will note your objection.' (Tr. at 453.) A review of the record reveals that during rebuttal closing arguments, the prosecutor stated to the jury, '[d]isturbing photographs, I hope they are disturbing to you. They should be disturbing to you. They should be disturbing and y'all should be outraged.' (Tr. at 436.) Defense counsel did not object to the foregoing remarks at the time they were made. The prosecutor also stated to the jury, '[t]he Judge has given you all of the law on these jury instructions. Right? That is the law that you've got to follow. And not one place in here will you find if Hanna Geiger, the victim, injected herself or because she wanted the drugs, that that means he is not culpable. You won't find that in here.' (Tr. at 439.) Defense counsel lodged a general objection to the foregoing statement, but the objection was overruled by the trial court. (Tr. at 439.) The prosecutor continued rebuttal closing arguments and informed the jury, '[a]gain, I never once said that she didn't inject herself. And you know, it doesn't matter. At the end of the day it doesn't matter if she injected it, smoked it, ate it. He still provided that cocaine to her.' (Tr. at 443.) Defense counsel made no objection to the foregoing remarks at the time the prosecutor made them. The prosecutor also stated to the jury, '[y]ou are here to judge the facts and determine whether the State has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant, Andrew Nichols -- not Hanna Geiger. She's not on trial here. She is the victim in this case.' (Tr. at 444.) Defense counsel objected to the prosecutor's use of the word 'victim,' but the objection was overruled by the trial court. (Tr. at 444.) Continuing rebuttal closing argument, the prosecutor informed the jury, '[y]ou have to decide this case. You follow the law, and it is did we prove our case beyond a reasonable doubt. I submit to you we did. And now he just wants to blame the victim, Hanna.' (Tr. at 446.) Defense counsel again objected to the use of the word 'victim' by the prosecutor, but the objection was overruled by the trial court. (Tr. at 446-47.) Upon consideration, we find the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to grant appellant's motion for mistrial premised on the foregoing remarks made by the prosecutor during rebuttal closing argument. First, regarding appellant's contention that the prosecutor improperly invited the jury to decide the case based on emotion rather than the facts of the case or the applicable law by stating to the jurors that they should be 'outraged' by what they saw in the photographs presented at trial, we reiterate that defense counsel made no objection to this remark at the time it was made. Accordingly, he has waived all but plain error on this point. Fudge at ¶ 49. Furthermore, we find no improper conduct on the part of the prosecutor in commenting that the jurors should be outraged in viewing the photographs of Hanna's body. This is so, because 'outrage' is an element of the offense of gross abuse of a corpse,7 one of the counts with which appellant had been charged. When this comment is viewed in context with the indictment, the jury instructions, and the prosecutor's earlier closing argument on this point (Tr. at 409-11), it is apparent that the comment was meant to reference the element of outrage included in the offense. (Tr. at 409-11.) As the prosecutor had to prove this element, it was not improper to urge the jury that they should be outraged by the photographs they viewed because the photographs were direct evidence of the treatment of Hanna Geiger's body by appellant. Put another way, this remark by the prosecutor was an entirely fair one because it was based on 'what the evidence has shown and what reasonable inferences may be drawn therefrom.' (Further citations omitted.) Fudge at ¶ 48, quoting Muhleka at ¶ 85, quoting Lott at 165. The jurors would have understood the prosecutor's comment in this context and they would not have taken the prosecutor's comment to be an invitation to abandon their responsibility to decide the case based on the law and the facts and instead improperly decide the case based on emotion. There was no misconduct on the part of the prosecutor in urging the jurors to be outraged by the photographs of Hanna's body, and there was no error, plain or otherwise, on the part of the trial court in denying the motion for mistrial on this basis. Next, we turn to appellant's complaint that the prosecutor improperly used the word 'victim' to describe Hanna Geiger three times during rebuttal closing argument. As set forth above, defense counsel lodged an objection each time the prosecutor referred to Hanna Geiger as a victim, and the trial court overruled each objection. In support of appellant's argument that the prosecutor's use of the term 'victim' during closing argument substantially affected the jurors' impartiality in evaluating the evidence to the prejudice of appellant, he cites to State v. Almedom, 10th Dist. No. 15AP-852, 2016-Ohio-1553, in which this court determined, sua sponte, that defense counsel in that case had been ineffective by failing to object to repeated references made by the trial judge to the child witnesses as 'victims.' We find Almedom readily distinguishable from the instant matter. First and foremost, in Almedom, the offending references to the witnesses as 'victims' were made by the trial judge, not the prosecutor. While a trial judge must remain detached and neutral in any matter before the court, the prosecutor is not constrained by any such obligation of neutrality. State v. Harper, 10th Dist. No. 01-AP-201, 2001-Ohio-8875. Secondly, in Almedom, the improper references were made throughout the entire trial. Here, the prosecutor's references to Hanna Geiger as a 'victim' were made only during rebuttal closing argument. As discussed above, during closing argument, the prosecutor is free to comment on 'what the evidence has shown and what reasonable inferences may be drawn therefrom.' (Internal quotations and citations omitted.) Fudge at ¶ 48. In our view, the prosecutor's references to Hanna Geiger as a 'victim' entailed fair comment on what the evidence had shown and were not improper. Thus, there was no misconduct on the part of the prosecutor in referring to Hanna Geiger as a victim, and there was no error on the part of the trial court in denying the motion for mistrial on this basis. Finally, we address appellant's contention that, in referencing the court's instructions to the jury, the prosecutor improperly asked the jury to disregard evidence by stating it did not matter that Hanna Geiger injected herself with the cocaine for purposes of determining whether appellant was culpable in Hanna's death. We reiterate that defense counsel made no objection to this remark at the time it was made. Accordingly, he has waived all but plain error on this issue. *Fudge* at ¶ 49. Furthermore, we do not agree that the prosecutor engaged in misconduct by asserting that for purposes of determining appellant’s culpability in Hanna Geiger’s death, whether Hanna injected the narcotics herself was of no import. Instead, we find the prosecutor was appropriately arguing the legal insignificance of this evidence as it pertained to the jury’s consideration of the involuntary manslaughter charge. This is so because pursuant to the court’s instructions, appellant was culpable in Hanna’s death if the jury found that appellant provided Hanna with the cocaine. Put another way, the fact that Hanna injected herself would not negate appellant’s culpability. Indeed, the prosecutor conceded that Hanna injected herself in explaining why this fact did not negate appellant’s culpability or provide a legal defense to the charge of involuntary manslaughter. (Tr. at 439, 443.) In short, Hanna’s act of self-injection 'would not change the basic fact that the victim took the drugs furnished by [the defendant] and died as a result.' *State v. Price*, 8th Dist. No. 107096, 2019-Ohio-1642, ¶ 89. The prosecutor did not improperly tell the jury that it did not matter if Hanna injected herself, and there was no error, plain or otherwise, on the part of the trial court in denying the motion for mistrial on this basis. Moreover, in considering all of appellants’ assertions of alleged prosecutorial misconduct during rebuttal closing argument, we observe the trial court instructed the jury 'the evidence does not include the indictment or opening statements or closing arguments of counsel. The opening statements and closing arguments of counsel are designed to assist you. They are not evidence.' (Jury Instr. at 2.) Thus, we presume that the jurors followed these instructions and the verdict was not based on the content of the closing arguments. *Fudge* at ¶ 52, citing at ¶ 26, citing *Pang* at 187. In short, appellant has failed to establish any prosecutorial misconduct during closing arguments which resulted in appellant being deprived of a fair trial. Therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellant’s motion for mistrial based on alleged prosecutorial misconduct, and appellant’s first assignment of error is overruled.\"\n}\n```"}

[Lynch’s] rights to due process and a fair trial were violated when the trial court denied his motion to dismiss for pre-indictment delay and then denied his motion to reconsider that ruling.", "discussion": "```json\n{\n  \"discussion\": \"In his first assignment of error, Lynch argues that the trial court erred by denying his motions to dismiss the indictment based on preindictment delay. The statute of limitations for a criminal offense is a defendant’s primary protection against overly stale criminal charges. However, in some circumstances, the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment provides limited protection against preindictment delay. The Ohio Supreme Court has held that an unjustifiable delay between the commission of an offense and a defendant’s indictment therefor, which results in actual prejudice to the defendant, is a violation of the right to due process of law. The Ohio Supreme Court recently reaffirmed a two-part, burden-shifting test to determine whether preindictment delay constitutes a due process violation. First, the burden is on the defendant to present evidence of actual prejudice; once a defendant does so, the burden then shifts to the state to produce evidence of a justifiable reason for the delay. A determination of actual prejudice involves a delicate judgment and a case-by-case consideration of the particular circumstances. The trial court indicated that it reviewed the case law set forth in Jones I, State v. Jones, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 101258, 2017-Ohio-176 (“Jones II”), Luck, 15 Ohio St.3d 150, 472 N.E.2d 1097, and Whiting, 84 Ohio St.3d 215, 217, 702 N.E.2d 1199. In denying defense counsel’s motion to reconsider, the trial court found the facts of this case to be distinguishable from Jones II. The trial court concluded, ‘I’m not convinced that actual prejudice has occurred from the delay. Even if we get to, you know, the point of actual prejudice in this case. In looking at it when the burden shifts to the State to show that it was not unjustifiable, you know, based on the facts here, I do find that a delay was justifiable anyway.’ (Tr. 596-597.) In reviewing a trial court’s decision on a motion to dismiss for preindictment delay, this court applies a de novo standard of review to the legal issues, but we afford great deference to the trial court’s findings of fact. After reviewing the record, we find that Lynch fails to demonstrate actual prejudice. Although Lynch offered an explanation of what purportedly exculpatory testimony S.P. would have offered, the unavailable testimony must be balanced against the evidence at the time of the indictment to determine whether Lynch would suffer actual prejudice. As noted above, the DNA evidence available at the time of the indictment revealed that Lynch could not be excluded as the source of semen on the vaginal swab from M.H.’s rape kit. We cannot say that S.P.’s testimony that the allegations against Lynch could not be true would minimize or eliminate the impact of the DNA evidence and bolster the defense. Furthermore, Lynch fails to demonstrate actual prejudice by speculating that he could have asserted an alibi based on S.P.’s testimony that he was in bed with her at the time M.H. alleged that he raped her. Although S.P. was not available to testify at trial, Lynch acknowledges that ‘[w]e know much of what [S.P.] would have testified to from her statements as they appear in [M.H.’s] medical record from the hospital at the time they took the rape kit.’ Appellant’s brief at 4. Regarding S.P.’s unavailable testimony about M.H.’s motive for fabricating the allegations, the record reflects that Lynch was available to testify, and did, in fact, testify about any motives M.H. may have had for fabricating the allegations. Lynch testified that S.P.’s children did not care for him, did not want him in the home, and wanted S.P. to be with their father rather than Lynch. Accordingly, S.P.’s testimony on this point would have been cumulative to Lynch’s testimony. Lynch’s claim of prejudice regarding the loss of CCDCFS records or notes is speculative at best. He presumes that the CCDCFS investigators took notes during the interviews of M.H. and Lynch, and retained these notes in the case file. As noted above, M.H. recanted her allegations against Lynch approximately two weeks after the May 26, 1994 incident. Lynch asserts that the missing CCDCFS records ‘would provide a concrete explanation of why there was no basis for the prosecution.’ Appellant’s reply brief at 5. Lynch presumes that the CCDCFS records or notes contained a ‘concrete explanation’ — other than the fact that M.H. recanted — as to why the allegations were found to be unsubstantiated. Lynch’s claim of prejudice regarding the loss of chain of custody information is also speculative. There is no evidence that the information regarding the storage conditions at the Fourth District or how the rape kit was transported to the main property room was initially preserved but subsequently lost as a result of the delay. The missing information may be evidence of an incomplete chain of custody; however, this defense would have existed regardless of the passage of time. See Jones II, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 101258, 2017-Ohio-176, at ¶ 9. Furthermore, several witnesses — BCI forensic scientist Andrea Dennis, Cleveland Police Officer Alex Parente, BCI forensic scientist Marissa Keeley, Cleveland Police Detective Michael Moctezuma, and Cuyahoga County Prosecutor’s Office Investigator Timothy Clark — were available to testify regarding the rape kit’s collection, sealing, storage, and transportation. Assuming, arguendo, that Lynch sufficiently demonstrated actual prejudice, we find that the trial court properly determined that the delay in prosecution was justified. Lynch argues that the state’s delay in bringing the charges against him was not justifiable because M.H. identified Lynch as her rapist both to S.P. and the police, and the police and prosecution allowed the rape kit to sit untested for 18 years. We disagree. The record reflects that the delay was a result of M.H. recanting her rape allegation approximately two weeks after reporting the allegation to her mother and the police in May 1994. Although a rape kit was conducted at the time of the incident, DNA evidence was not discovered until 2014 when the rape kit was tested by BCI. The DNA evidence establishing that Lynch could not be excluded as a contributor to the DNA profile from M.H.’s rape kit was ‘new evidence’ that justified the delayed indictment. Based on the foregoing analysis, Lynch’s first assignment of error is overruled.\"\n}\n```"}

Lynch argues that the state’s delay in bringing the charges against him was not justifiable because M.H. identified Lynch as her rapist both to S.P. and the police, and the police and prosecution allowed the rape kit to sit untested for 18 years. We disagree. The record reflects that the delay was a result of M.H. recanting her rape allegation approximately two weeks after reporting the allegation to her mother and the police in May 1994. Although a rape kit was conducted at the time of the incident, DNA evidence was not discovered until 2014 when the rape kit was tested by BCI. The DNA evidence establishing that Lynch could not be excluded as a contributor to the DNA profile from M.H.’s rape kit was ‘new evidence’ that justified the delayed indictment. Based on the foregoing analysis, Lynch’s first assignment of error is overruled.\"\n}\n```"}

Because there was no manifest necessity for the trial court to grant a mistrial, the constitutional protection against being twice put in jeopardy for the same offense required that the charges against [Lynch] be dismissed.", "discussion": "```json\n{\n  \"discussion\": \"In his first assignment of error, Lynch argues that the trial court erred by denying his motions to dismiss the indictment based on preindictment delay. The statute of limitations for a criminal offense is a defendant’s primary protection against overly stale criminal charges. However, in some circumstances, the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment provides limited protection against preindictment delay. The Ohio Supreme Court has held that an unjustifiable delay between the commission of an offense and a defendant’s indictment therefor, which results in actual prejudice to the defendant, is a violation of the right to due process of law. The Ohio Supreme Court recently reaffirmed a two-part, burden-shifting test to determine whether preindictment delay constitutes a due process violation. First, the burden is on the defendant to present evidence of actual prejudice; once a defendant does so, the burden then shifts to the state to produce evidence of a justifiable reason for the delay. A determination of actual prejudice involves a delicate judgment and a case-by-case consideration of the particular circumstances. The trial court indicated that it reviewed the case law set forth in Jones I, State v. Jones, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 101258, 2017-Ohio-176 (“Jones II”), Luck, 15 Ohio St.3d 150, 472 N.E.2d 1097, and Whiting, 84 Ohio St.3d 215, 217, 702 N.E.2d 1199. In denying defense counsel’s motion to reconsider, the trial court found the facts of this case to be distinguishable from Jones II. The trial court concluded, ‘I’m not convinced that actual prejudice has occurred from the delay. Even if we get to, you know, the point of actual prejudice in this case. In looking at it when the burden shifts to the State to show that it was not unjustifiable, you know, based on the facts here, I do find that a delay was justifiable anyway.’ (Tr. 596-597.) In reviewing a trial court’s decision on a motion to dismiss for preindictment delay, this court applies a de novo standard of review to the legal issues, but we afford great deference to the trial court’s findings of fact. After reviewing the record, we find that Lynch fails to demonstrate actual prejudice. Although Lynch offered an explanation of what purportedly exculpatory testimony S.P. would have offered, the unavailable testimony must be balanced against the evidence at the time of the indictment to determine whether Lynch would suffer actual prejudice. As noted above, the DNA evidence available at the time of the indictment revealed that Lynch could not be excluded as the source of semen on the vaginal swab from M.H.’s rape kit. We cannot say that S.P.’s testimony that the allegations against Lynch could not be true would minimize or eliminate the impact of the DNA evidence and bolster the defense. Furthermore, Lynch fails to demonstrate actual prejudice by speculating that he could have asserted an alibi based on S.P.’s testimony that he was in bed with her at the time M.H. alleged that he raped her. Although S.P. was not available to testify at trial, Lynch acknowledges that ‘[w]e know much of what [S.P.] would have testified to from her statements as they appear in [M.H.’s] medical record from the hospital at the time they took the rape kit.’ Appellant’s brief at 4. Regarding S.P.’s unavailable testimony about M.H.’s motive for fabricating the allegations, the record reflects that Lynch was available to testify, and did, in fact, testify about any motives M.H. may have had for fabricating the allegations. Lynch testified that S.P.’s children did not care for him, did not want him in the home, and wanted S.P. to be with their father rather than Lynch. Accordingly, S.P.’s testimony on this point would have been cumulative to Lynch’s testimony. Lynch’s claim of prejudice regarding the loss of CCDCFS records or notes is speculative at best. He presumes that the CCDCFS investigators took notes during the interviews of M.H. and Lynch, and retained these notes in the case file. As noted above, M.H. recanted her allegations against Lynch approximately two weeks after the May 26, 1994 incident. Lynch asserts that the missing CCDCFS records ‘would provide a concrete explanation of why there was no basis for the prosecution.’ Appellant’s reply brief at 5. Lynch presumes that the CCDCFS records or notes contained a ‘concrete explanation’ — other than the fact that M.H. recanted — as to why the allegations were found to be unsubstantiated. Lynch’s claim of prejudice regarding the loss of chain of custody information is also speculative. There is no evidence that the information regarding the storage conditions at the Fourth District or how the rape kit was transported to the main property room was initially preserved but subsequently lost as a result of the delay. The missing information may be evidence of an incomplete chain of custody; however, this defense would have existed regardless of the passage of time. See Jones II, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 101258, 2017-Ohio-176, at ¶ 9. Furthermore, several witnesses — BCI forensic scientist Andrea Dennis, Cleveland Police Officer Alex Parente, BCI forensic scientist Marissa Keeley, Cleveland Police Detective Michael Moctezuma, and Cuyahoga County Prosecutor’s Office Investigator Timothy Clark — were available to testify regarding the rape kit’s collection, sealing, storage, and transportation.

The DNA evidence establishing that Lynch could not be excluded as a contributor to the DNA profile from M.H.’s rape kit was ‘new evidence’ that justified the delayed indictment.

The first witness was Dilbag, who had moved to New York. The second witness was Lovell, whom detectives were unable to find. The trial court found that both witnesses were unavailable, despite reasonable efforts having been made to secure their appearances. As a result, the trial court allowed the testimony of Dilbag and Lovell from the first trial to be read to the jury in the second trial. In his first assignment of error, Jones argues that the trial court abused its discretion by finding that the witnesses were unavailable. With regard to Dilbag, Jones argues that the state did not show that it had used reasonable efforts because it failed to issue an out-of-state subpoena pursuant to R.C. 2939.26. This argument was not raised below. Since Jones failed to raise this argument below, he has waived all but plain error. To establish plain error pursuant to Crim.R. 52(B), Jones must show “(1) that an error occurred, (2) that the error was obvious, and (3) that the error affected the outcome of the trial.” There was nothing in Dilbag's interaction with law enforcement up until the eve of trial that would have put the state on notice that use of the statute's procedure would have been required. Detective Shawn Cox from the Hamilton County Sheriff’s Office testified that he had told Dilbag that he would need to testify at the second trial, and Dilbag indicated that he would do so if he could. He had told the detective that he would need to be compensated for the lost time at work, information Cox said he passed on to the prosecutor. Cox said that he was not able to serve a subpoena on Dilbag because his department could not pay to send him to New York City. While Cox had been in relatively consistent contact with Dilbag since the first trial, the communications dropped off about one week before the second trial was to begin. Calls to Dilbag the week before the trial went straight to voicemail. Cox said that, at that point, Dilbag was “refusing to, in my opinion, come back and refusing to even take my calls at this point.” In light of the fact that Cox did not have reason to suspect that Dilbag would not be cooperative until days before the trial started, the state need not have resorted to the procedures outlined in R.C. 2939.26 to satisfy the requirement that it had used reasonable efforts to secure Dilbag’s appearance. Therefore, it was not plain error for the trial court not to have sua sponte considered the state’s failure to utilize the procedure. On the issue of Lovell’s unavailability, Jones argues that the state’s failure to issue a subpoena to her mother’s house was the reason that the state’s efforts were not reasonable. But there is no indication that this would have been effective. Cox testified that Lovell had been evicted from her apartment and was believed to be homeless. Cox had attempted to contact Lovell through social media and three different cell phone numbers without success. Cox stayed in contact with Lovell’s mother, who did not know where she was and was unable to contact her. Lovell’s mother had hoped to find her by attending a court hearing that Lovell had scheduled in an unrelated matter, but Lovell did not appear at that hearing. There is no indication in the record that issuing a subpoena to Lovell at her mother’s address would have been effective in securing her appearance. The trial court did not abuse its discretion when it found her to be unavailable and allowed the state to read her prior testimony to the jury.\"\n}\n```"}

Cox said that, at that point, Dilbag was “refusing to, in my opinion, come back and refusing to even take my calls at this point.” In light of the fact that Cox did not have reason to suspect that Dilbag would not be cooperative until days before the trial started, the state need not have resorted to the procedures outlined in R.C. 2939.26 to satisfy the requirement that it had used reasonable efforts to secure Dilbag’s appearance. Therefore, it was not plain error for the trial court not to have sua sponte considered the state’s failure to utilize the procedure.

But there is no indication that this would have been effective. Cox testified that Lovell had been evicted from her apartment and was believed to be homeless. Cox had attempted to contact Lovell through social media and three different cell phone numbers without success. Cox stayed in contact with Lovell’s mother, who did not know where she was and was unable to contact her. Lovell’s mother had hoped to find her by attending a court hearing that Lovell had scheduled in an unrelated matter, but Lovell did not appear at that hearing.

During her opening statement, the state’s attorney told the jury that police came to A.W.’s home the morning that she reported her daughter’s rape, and while they were there, encountered Moore. The state’s attorney told the jury that ‘Chief Meister asked if [Moore] had—would like to come down to the police department,’ but ‘[Moore] refused, as is his right to do.’ Defense counsel objected. He argued that Moore had ‘a right to counsel and the fact that he didn’t want to be interviewed by a police officer * * * is wildly inadmissible.’ He insisted that this was ‘major error.’ The state’s attorney offered to have the comment stricken. Instead, the court addressed the jury and told them that it was Moore’s right not to give a statement and to disregard any remark about Moore’s decision not to give a statement to the police. It instructed the jury that ‘nothing can be inferred from the fact that defendant chose not to give a statement to the police at that time.’ Moore moved for a mistrial, which the court denied. The Ohio Supreme Court has recognized that ‘[u]se of a defendant’s pre-arrest silence as substantive evidence of guilt violates the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.’ State v. Leach, 102 Ohio St.3d 135, 2004-Ohio-2147, 807 N.E.2d 335. We, therefore, agree with Moore that the state improperly commented on his refusal to accompany Chief Meister to the police station.

In the context of examining whether prejudice has resulted from the state’s comment about the defendant’s assertion of his right to silence, courts consider factors such as ‘the extent of the comments, whether an inference of guilt from silence was stressed to the jury, and the extent of other evidence suggesting the defendant’s guilt.’ State v.

Defense counsel objected and the trial court offered a limiting instruction.

Here, while the state should not have commented on Moore’s refusal to go to the station, the remark was isolated and was followed by an acknowledgment by the state that Moore had the right to refuse to go to the station at that point.

Lorain No. 99CA007451, 2001 WL 39604, *2-3 (Jan. 17, 2001) (finding no prejudice where prosecutor’s improper comment about defendant’s silence ‘was discrete in nature, led to an immediately sustained objection, was retracted by an apology by the prosecutor, and was not repeated.’). Here, while the state should not have commented on Moore’s refusal to go to the station, the remark was isolated and was followed by an acknowledgment by the state that Moore had the right to refuse to go to the station at that point. The trial court immediately issued a curative instruction, admonishing the jury to disregard the statement. ‘A jury is presumed to follow instructions of the court and to obey curative instructions.’ State v. McAlphine, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 79216, 2002 WL 120529, *7 (Jan. 24, 2002), citing State v. Loza, 71 Ohio St.3d 61, 79, 641 N.E.2d 1082 (1984). Moreover, the comment was never revisited and the evidence against Moore was strong and included testimony from the victim and her mother, medical records and testimony from the SANE nurse who observed injury consistent with the victim’s account, and corroborating DNA evidence.

He claims that the state’s comments suggested to the jury that this demonstrated his guilt. During her opening statement, the state’s attorney told the jury that police came to A.W.’s home the morning that she reported her daughter’s rape, and while they were there, encountered Moore. The state’s attorney told the jury that ‘Chief Meister asked if [Moore] had—would like to come down to the police department,’ but ‘[Moore] refused, as is his right to do.’ Defense counsel objected. He argued that Moore had ‘a right to counsel and the fact that he didn’t want to be interviewed by a police officer * * * is wildly inadmissible.’ He insisted that this was ‘major error.’ The state’s attorney offered to have the comment stricken. Instead, the court addressed the jury and told them that it was Moore’s right not to give a statement and to disregard any remark about Moore’s decision not to give a statement to the police. It instructed the jury that ‘nothing can be inferred from the fact that defendant chose not to give a statement to the police at that time.’ Moore moved for a mistrial, which the court denied. The Ohio Supreme Court has recognized that ‘[u]se of a defendant’s pre-arrest silence as substantive evidence of guilt violates the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.’ State v. Leach, 102 Ohio St.3d 135, 2004-Ohio-2147, 807 N.E.2d 335. We, therefore, agree with Moore that the state improperly commented on his refusal to accompany Chief Meister to the police station. See State v. Shea, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. B-840720, 1985 WL 8938, *3 (July 17, 1985) (‘Where * * * the state interjects the defendant’s prearrest silence into the case in its opening statement, it does so in error.’). But ‘violations of a defendant’s constitutional right against self-incrimination are subject to a harmless error review.’ State v. Castle, 2017-Ohio-942, 86 N.E.3d 813, ¶ 22 (7th Dist.). Error is harmless under Crim.R. 52(A) if it does not affect substantial rights. ‘In most cases, in order to be viewed as ‘affecting substantial rights,’ the error must have been prejudicial.’ (Internal citations and quotations omitted.) State v. Harris, 142 Ohio St.3d 211, 2015-Ohio-166, 28 N.E.3d 1256, ¶ 36. An error will be deemed ‘prejudicial’ if there is a reasonable probability that it affected the outcome of the judicial proceedings. State v. Taylor, 2017-Ohio-4395, 93 N.E.3d 1, ¶ 15 (4th Dist.). In the context of examining whether prejudice has resulted from the state’s comment about the defendant’s assertion of his right to silence, courts consider factors such as ‘the extent of the comments, whether an inference of guilt from silence was stressed to the jury, and the extent of other evidence suggesting the defendant’s guilt.’ State v. Contreras, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 89728, 2008-Ohio-1413, ¶ 34. In State v. Ramey, 5th Dist. Delaware No. 12 CAC 03 0034, 2013-Ohio-665, the Fifth District considered whether similar remarks constituted prejudicial error. There, the state told the jury during opening statement that ‘[t]hey attempted to talk to [the defendant] again, she declined any further interviews with them and so—.’ Id. at ¶ 12. Defense counsel objected and the trial court offered a limiting instruction. While the appellate court found the prosecutor’s remark to be improper, it found no prejudicial error because the evidence against the defendant was strong, ‘the trial court immediately ordered the jury to disregard the statement, and the issue was not revisited.’ Id. at ¶ 21. See also State v. Smith, 9th Dist. Lorain No. 99CA007451, 2001 WL 39604, *2-3 (Jan. 17, 2001) (finding no prejudice where prosecutor’s improper comment about defendant’s silence ‘was discrete in nature, led to an immediately sustained objection, was retracted by an apology by the prosecutor, and was not repeated.’).

Martin argues that the one-person arrest-scene show-up in which Rickman, Cannon, and Johnson identified him was impermissibly suggestive. Martin challenges as suggestive the fact that he was the only suspect presented at the show-up, he was in handcuffs in the back seat of a police cruiser, and the police failed to resort to less suggestive means like a more traditional lineup. He further contends that the identifications were unreliable under the totality of the circumstances. He maintains that none of witnesses' observations satisfy the factors set forth in Neil v. Biggers, 409 U.S. 188, 93 S.Ct. 375, 34 L.Ed.2d 401 (1972). Assuming without deciding that the show-up procedure employed by the police was suggestive, we cannot conclude the trial court erred by failing to suppress the three witnesses' identifications where the totality of the circumstances and all five of the Biggers factors supported the trial court's finding that the witnesses' identifications of Martin were sufficiently reliable. All three witnesses had a good opportunity to view Martin during the commission of the crimes; they provided consistent and thorough descriptions of him to the police and to the 911 operator; they were certain of the identification at the time; and they identified Martin within 30 minutes after the crime while their memories were still fresh. Martin also argues that the state failed to comply with R.C. 2933.83(B) which requires any law enforcement agency that conducts a live lineup to adopt specific procedures for conducting the lineup. R.C. 2933.83(A)(7) defines a 'live lineup' as an 'identification procedure in which a group of persons, including the suspected perpetrator of an offense and other persons not suspected of the offense, is displayed to an eyewitness for the purpose of determining whether the eyewitness identifies the suspect as the perpetrator of the offense.' The one-person show-up identification utilized by the police in this case does not satisfy the statutory definition of a live lineup. Thus, R.C. 2933.83 does not apply. We hold that the trial court properly denied Martin’s motion to suppress. Therefore, we overrule the first assignment of error.\"\n}\n```"}

Appellant argues that trying the illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented material count with the other counts would prejudice his defense against the remaining charges of rape, kidnapping, etc. Appellant cites *State v. Slaven*, 191 Ohio App.3d 340, 2010-Ohio-6400 (court erred in joining sexual assault of two different children because evidence in one case would not be admissible in the other) and *State v. Clements*, 98 Ohio App.3d 797, 649 N.E.2d 912 (2nd Dist. 1994 (error for court to join unrelated charges of burglary and robbery in the same trial) in support of his argument. In response, the State argues that Ohio law favors joinder of offenses that are of the same or similar character citing *State v. Hariston*, 4th Dist. Scioto No. 06CA3081, 2007-Ohio-3880. The State argues that the offense of illegal use of nudity-oriented material involving a minor is similar in character to sex offenses committed against A.C. because both involve child victims and criminal sexual behavior. The State also submits that the evidence was admissible as ‘other acts evidence.’ However, as the State recognizes, other acts evidence cannot be used to show that the defendant acted in conformity with his character, but may be admitted to show a defendant’s scheme, plan, or system in doing an act. Although not made clear in its brief, the State appears to imply that Appellant’s possession of nudity-oriented materials was evidence of a plan to commit the rape offenses against A.C. The trial court denied Appellant’s motion to sever count two, and Appellant did not renew his motion at the close of the State’s case or at the close of all the evidence. Therefore, we review this assignment of error under a plain error analysis. Crim.R. 8(A) provides that: ‘[t]wo or more offenses may be charged in the same indictment, * * * in a separate count for each offense if the offenses charged * * * are of the same or similar character * * *.’ ‘Courts broadly construe the phrase ‘of the same or similar character’ so that joinder of similar offenses is generally the rule, not the exception.’ *State v. Parham*, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 16AP-826, 2019-Ohio-358, 121 N.E.3d 412, ¶ 24, citing *State v. Kennedy*, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-120337, 2013-Ohio-4221, 998 N.E.2d 1189, ¶ 26, *State v. Bennie*, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-020497, 2004-Ohio-1264, 2004 WL 535277, ¶ 17. ‘The law favors joining multiple criminal offenses in a single trial.’ *State v. Franklin*, 62 Ohio St.3d 118, 122, 580 N.E.2d 1 (1991), citing Crim.R. 8(A), *State v. Lott*, 51 Ohio St.3d 160, 163, 555 N.E.2d 293 (1990). ‘This is because joint trials ‘conserve state funds, diminish inconvenience to witnesses and public authorities, and avoid delays in bringing those accused of crime to trial.’’ State v. Gordon, 152 Ohio St.3d 528, 532, 2018-Ohio-259, 98 N.E.3d 251, ¶ 18, quoting Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123, 134, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968). However, Crim.R. 14 states: ‘If it appears that a defendant * * * is prejudiced by a joinder of offenses * * * for trial together, the court shall order an election or separate trial of counts * * * or provide such other relief as justice requires.’ Therefore, ‘a trial court should order separate trials pursuant to Crim.R. 14 if it appears the defendant is prejudiced by the joinder.’ Gordon, 152 Ohio St.3d 528, 533, 2018-Ohio-259, 98 N.E.3d 251, ¶ 20. A defendant claiming that a trial court erred in not severing charges ‘has the burden of affirmatively showing that his rights were prejudiced; he must furnish the trial court with sufficient information so that it [could] weigh the considerations favoring joinder against the defendant's right to a fair trial * * *.’ State v. Torres, 66 Ohio St.2d 340, 421 N.E.2d 1288 (1981), at the syllabus. ‘[C]laims of prejudice are less persuasive where the evidence is “amply sufficient to sustain each verdict, whether or not the indictments were tried together.” State v. Sapp, 105 Ohio St.3d 104, 2004-Ohio-7008, The State has two methods it may use to negate any claims of prejudice caused by joinder: (1) it may argue that it could have introduced evidence of the separate count under the “other acts” portion of Evid.R. 404(B) as recognized in State v. Lott, 51 Ohio St.3d 160, 163, 555 N.E.2d 293, or (2) show that the evidence of each crime joined at trial is simple and direct as was recognized in Torres, 66 Ohio St.2d 340, 344, 421 N.E.2d 1288 (1981), State v. Miller, 105 Ohio App.3d 679, 691-692, 664 N.E.2d 1309 (4th Dist. 1995). ‘‘[W]hen simple and direct evidence exists, an accused is not prejudiced by joinder regardless of the nonadmissibility of evidence of these crimes as ‘other acts’ under Evid.R. 404(B).’’ Id. at 691, quoting Lott, 51 Ohio St.3d at 163, 555 N.E.2d at 297. In Appellant’s one-page brief filed in the trial court, he alleged that ‘trying the two charges together would prejudice him in the eyes of the jury by portraying him in an unfavorable light.’ And in his appellate brief, Appellant alleges that the child pornography has no relevancy to the sexual assault allegations regarding A.C. He also alleges that the evidence supporting the child pornography was ‘speculative and weak.’ We find that Appellant did not satisfy his affirmative burden in the trial court showing that his rights were prejudiced because he didn’t furnish the trial court with ‘sufficient information so that it [could] weigh the considerations favoring joinder against the defendant's right to a fair trial.’ In his appeal, Appellant submits there is no relevancy between the illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented material and the sexual assault charges (rape, kidnapping). However, nowhere does he argue how trying all the charges together will result in prejudice. We also find that the cases Appellant cites (Slaven - court erred in joining sexual assault of two different children because evidence in one case would not be admissible in the other, and Clements - error for court to join unrelated charges of burglary and robbery in the same trial) are not particularly persuasive to the particular facts of this case. Accordingly, we find that Appellant has failed his burden of ‘affirmatively showing that his rights were prejudiced’ in the trial court or on appeal, so there is no plain error. Even assuming arguendo that trying count two with the remaining charges did result in prejudice, because there is evidence ‘amply sufficient to sustain each verdict, whether or not the indictments were tried together,’ Appellant’s claim of prejudice from trying the sexual assault claims with the illegal use of nudity-oriented material is less persuasive. _Sapp_, 105 Ohio St.3d at ¶ 73. We also find that the evidence in this case supporting both the illegal use of nudity-oriented material and the sexual assault charges against A.C. is ‘simple and direct’ and therefore trying them together was not reversible error. _See State v. Craig_, 11th Dist. Lake No. 2016-L-113, 2017-Ohio-8939, ¶ 29-31. In _Craig_, the defendant was charged with numerous criminal counts, including rape of his daughter and pandering obscenity involving a minor for possessing ‘749 photographs/videos of child pornography, with many of pictures featuring girls appearing to be the same age [as the victim].’ _Id._ at ¶ 10. The defendant in _Craig_ appealed the trial court’s denial of his motion to sever the pandering obscenity involving a minor charge from the rape charge, alleging it denied him a fair trial. _Id._ at ¶ 22. While the court found that the images from the pandering charge were not admissible in regard to the rape charge under Evid.R. 404(B), it went on to find that ‘[g]iven the nature of the basic elements of the eleven counts, the provocable evidence necessary to prove those counts is simple and direct.’ _Id._ at ¶ 30. The court of appeals found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the defendant’s motion to sever. Similar to Craig, Appellant was convicted of illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented material based images of naked juveniles, some engaging in sex acts, that were recovered from Appellant’s PS3, and his rape conviction was based on physical evidence of injury to A.C.’s genital area together with her testimony identifying Appellant as the perpetrator. We find the evidence of both charges was ‘simple and direct.’ Therefore, even assuming arguendo that trying both charges together could have resulted in prejudice, the simple and direct evidence supporting both charges dictates the trial court’s refusal to sever the charges is not plain error. State v. Miller, 105 Ohio App.3d 679, 690-692, 664 N.E.2d 1309 (4th Dist. 1995) (Simple and direct evidence negates any prejudice). For all the aforementioned reasons, under these facts, we find no plain error because the trial court’s refusal to sever count two did not affect Appellant’s substantial rights so as to create a manifest miscarriage of justice. Therefore, we overrule Appellant’s first assignment or error.\"\n}\n```"}

In _Craig_, the defendant was charged with numerous criminal counts, including rape of his daughter and pandering obscenity involving a minor for possessing ‘749 photographs/videos of child pornography, with many of pictures featuring girls appearing to be the same age [as the victim].’ _Id._ at ¶ 10. The defendant in _Craig_ appealed the trial court’s denial of his motion to sever the pandering obscenity involving a minor charge from the rape charge, alleging it denied him a fair trial. _Id._ at ¶ 22. While the court found that the images from the pandering charge were not admissible in regard to the rape charge under Evid.R. 404(B), it went on to find that ‘[g]iven the nature of the basic elements of the eleven counts, the provocable evidence necessary to prove those counts is simple and direct.’ _Id._ at ¶ 30. The court of appeals found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the defendant’s motion to sever. Similar to Craig, Appellant was convicted of illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented material based images of naked juveniles, some engaging in sex acts, that were recovered from Appellant’s PS3, and his rape conviction was based on physical evidence of injury to A.C.’s genital area together with her testimony identifying Appellant as the perpetrator. We find the evidence of both charges was ‘simple and direct.’ Therefore, even assuming arguendo that trying both charges together could have resulted in prejudice, the simple and direct evidence supporting both charges dictates the trial court’s refusal to sever the charges is not plain error. State v. Miller, 105 Ohio App.3d 679, 690-692, 664 N.E.2d 1309 (4th Dist. 1995) (Simple and direct evidence negates any prejudice). For all the aforementioned reasons, under these facts, we find no plain error because the trial court’s refusal to sever count two did not affect Appellant’s substantial rights so as to create a manifest miscarriage of justice. Therefore, we overrule Appellant’s first assignment or error.\"\n}\n```"}

Appellant argues that trying the illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented material count with the other counts would prejudice his defense against the remaining charges of rape, kidnapping, etc. Appellant cites *State v. Slaven*, 191 Ohio App.3d 340, 2010-Ohio-6400 (court erred in joining sexual assault of two different children because evidence in one case would not be admissible in the other) and *State v. Clements*, 98 Ohio App.3d 797, 649 N.E.2d 912 (2nd Dist. 1994 (error for court to join unrelated charges of burglary and robbery in the same trial) in support of his argument. In response, the State argues that Ohio law favors joinder of offenses that are of the same or similar character citing *State v. Hariston*, 4th Dist. Scioto No. 06CA3081, 2007-Ohio-3880. The State argues that the offense of illegal use of nudity-oriented material involving a minor is similar in character to sex offenses committed against A.C. because both involve child victims and criminal sexual behavior. The State also submits that the evidence was admissible as ‘other acts evidence.’ However, as the State recognizes, other acts evidence cannot be used to show that the defendant acted in conformity with his character, but may be admitted to show a defendant’s scheme, plan, or system in doing an act. Although not made clear in its brief, the State appears to imply that Appellant’s possession of nudity-oriented materials was evidence of a plan to commit the rape offenses against A.C. The trial court denied Appellant’s motion to sever count two, and Appellant did not renew his motion at the close of the State’s case or at the close of all the evidence. Therefore, we review this assignment of error under a plain error analysis. Crim.R. 8(A) provides that: ‘[t]wo or more offenses may be charged in the same indictment, * * * in a separate count for each offense if the offenses charged * * * are of the same or similar character * * *.’ ‘Courts broadly construe the phrase ‘of the same or similar character’ so that joinder of similar offenses is generally the rule, not the exception.’ *State v.

Bennie*, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-020497, 2004-Ohio-1264, 2004 WL 535277, ¶ 17. ‘The law favors joining multiple criminal offenses in a single trial.’ *State v. Franklin*, 62 Ohio St.3d 118, 122, 580 N.E.2d 1 (1991), citing Crim.R. 8(A), *State v. Lott*, 51 Ohio St.3d 160, 163, 555 N.E.2d 293 (1990). ‘This is because joint trials ‘conserve state funds, diminish inconvenience to witnesses and public authorities, and avoid delays in bringing those accused of crime to trial.’’ State v. Gordon, 152 Ohio St.3d 528, 532, 2018-Ohio-259, 98 N.E.3d 251, ¶ 18, quoting Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123, 134, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968). However, Crim.R. 14 states: ‘If it appears that a defendant * * * is prejudiced by a joinder of offenses * * * for trial together, the court shall order an election or separate trial of counts * * * or provide such other relief as justice requires.’ Therefore, ‘a trial court should order separate trials pursuant to Crim.R. 14 if it appears the defendant is prejudiced by the joinder.’ Gordon, 152 Ohio St.3d 528, 533, 2018-Ohio-259, 98 N.E.3d 251, ¶ 20. A defendant claiming that a trial court erred in not severing charges ‘has the burden of affirmatively showing that his rights were prejudiced; he must furnish the trial court with sufficient information so that it [could] weigh the considerations favoring joinder against the defendant's right to a fair trial * * *.’ State v. Torres, 66 Ohio St.2d 340, 421 N.E.2d 1288 (1981), at the syllabus. ‘[C]laims of prejudice are less persuasive where the evidence is “amply sufficient to sustain each verdict, whether or not the indictments were tried together.” State v. Sapp, 105 Ohio St.3d 104, 2004-Ohio-7008, The State has two methods it may use to negate any claims of prejudice caused by joinder: (1) it may argue that it could have introduced evidence of the separate count under the “other acts” portion of Evid.R. 404(B) as recognized in State v. Lott, 51 Ohio St.3d 160, 163, 555 N.E.2d 293, or (2) show that the evidence of each crime joined at trial is simple and direct as was recognized in Torres, 66 Ohio St.2d 340, 344, 421 N.E.2d 1288 (1981), State v. Miller, 105 Ohio App.3d 679, 691-692, 664 N.E.2d 1309 (4th Dist. 1995). ‘‘[W]hen simple and direct evidence exists, an accused is not prejudiced by joinder regardless of the nonadmissibility of evidence of these crimes as ‘other acts’ under Evid.R. 404(B).’’ Id. at 691, quoting Lott, 51 Ohio St.3d at 163, 555 N.E.2d at 297. In Appellant’s one-page brief filed in the trial court, he alleged that ‘trying the two charges together would prejudice him in the eyes of the jury by portraying him in an unfavorable light.’ And in his appellate brief, Appellant alleges that the child pornography has no relevancy to the sexual assault allegations regarding A.C. He also alleges that the evidence supporting the child pornography was ‘speculative and weak.’ We find that Appellant did not satisfy his affirmative burden in the trial court showing that his rights were prejudiced because he didn’t furnish the trial court with ‘sufficient information so that it [could] weigh the considerations favoring joinder against the defendant's right to a fair trial.’ In his appeal, Appellant submits there is no relevancy between the illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented material and the sexual assault charges (rape, kidnapping). However, nowhere does he argue how trying all the charges together will result in prejudice. We also find that the cases Appellant cites (Slaven - court erred in joining sexual assault of two different children because evidence in one case would not be admissible in the other, and Clements - error for court to join unrelated charges of burglary and robbery in the same trial) are not particularly persuasive to the particular facts of this case. Accordingly, we find that Appellant has failed his burden of ‘affirmatively showing that his rights were prejudiced’ in the trial court or on appeal, so there is no plain error. Even assuming arguendo that trying count two with the remaining charges did result in prejudice, because there is evidence ‘amply sufficient to sustain each verdict, whether or not the indictments were tried together,’ Appellant’s claim of prejudice from trying the sexual assault claims with the illegal use of nudity-oriented material is less persuasive. _Sapp_, 105 Ohio St.3d at ¶ 73.

In _Craig_, the defendant was charged with numerous criminal counts, including rape of his daughter and pandering obscenity involving a minor for possessing ‘749 photographs/videos of child pornography, with many of pictures featuring girls appearing to be the same age [as the victim].’ _Id._ at ¶ 10. The defendant in _Craig_ appealed the trial court’s denial of his motion to sever the pandering obscenity involving a minor charge from the rape charge, alleging it denied him a fair trial. _Id._ at ¶ 22. While the court found that the images from the pandering charge were not admissible in regard to the rape charge under Evid.R. 404(B), it went on to find that ‘[g]iven the nature of the basic elements of the eleven counts, the provocable evidence necessary to prove those counts is simple and direct.’ _Id._ at ¶ 30. The court of appeals found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the defendant’s motion to sever. Similar to Craig, Appellant was convicted of illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented material based images of naked juveniles, some engaging in sex acts, that were recovered from Appellant’s PS3, and his rape conviction was based on physical evidence of injury to A.C.’s genital area together with her testimony identifying Appellant as the perpetrator. We find the evidence of both charges was ‘simple and direct.’ Therefore, even assuming arguendo that trying both charges together could have resulted in prejudice, the simple and direct evidence supporting both charges dictates the trial court’s refusal to sever the charges is not plain error. State v. Miller, 105 Ohio App.3d 679, 690-692, 664 N.E.2d 1309 (4th Dist. 1995) (Simple and direct evidence negates any prejudice). For all the aforementioned reasons, under these facts, we find no plain error because the trial court’s refusal to sever count two did not affect Appellant’s substantial rights so as to create a manifest miscarriage of justice. Therefore, we overrule Appellant’s first assignment or error.\"\n}\n```"}

Appellant argues that trying the illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented material count with the other counts would prejudice his defense against the remaining charges of rape, kidnapping, etc. Appellant cites *State v. Slaven*, 191 Ohio App.3d 340, 2010-Ohio-6400 (court erred in joining sexual assault of two different children because evidence in one case would not be admissible in the other) and *State v. Clements*, 98 Ohio App.3d 797, 649 N.E.2d 912 (2nd Dist. 1994 (error for court to join unrelated charges of burglary and robbery in the same trial) in support of his argument. In response, the State argues that Ohio law favors joinder of offenses that are of the same or similar character citing *State v. Hariston*, 4th Dist. Scioto No. 06CA3081, 2007-Ohio-3880. The State argues that the offense of illegal use of nudity-oriented material involving a minor is similar in character to sex offenses committed against A.C. because both involve child victims and criminal sexual behavior. The State also submits that the evidence was admissible as ‘other acts evidence.’ However, as the State recognizes, other acts evidence cannot be used to show that the defendant acted in conformity with his character, but may be admitted to show a defendant’s scheme, plan, or system in doing an act. Although not made clear in its brief, the State appears to imply that Appellant’s possession of nudity-oriented materials was evidence of a plan to commit the rape offenses against A.C. The trial court denied Appellant’s motion to sever count two, and Appellant did not renew his motion at the close of the State’s case or at the close of all the evidence. Therefore, we review this assignment of error under a plain error analysis. Crim.R. 8(A) provides that: ‘[t]wo or more offenses may be charged in the same indictment, * * * in a separate count for each offense if the offenses charged * * * are of the same or similar character * * *.’ ‘Courts broadly construe the phrase ‘of the same or similar character’ so that joinder of similar offenses is generally the rule, not the exception.’ *State v. Parham*, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 16AP-826, 2019-Ohio-358, 121 N.E.3d 412, ¶ 24, citing *State v. Kennedy*, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-120337, 2013-Ohio-4221, 998 N.E.2d 1189, ¶ 26, *State v. Bennie*, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-020497, 2004-Ohio-1264, 2004 WL 535277, ¶ 17. ‘The law favors joining multiple criminal offenses in a single trial.’ *State v. Franklin*, 62 Ohio St.3d 118, 122, 580 N.E.2d 1 (1991), citing Crim.R. 8(A), *State v. Lott*, 51 Ohio St.3d 160, 163, 555 N.E.2d 293 (1990). ‘This is because joint trials ‘conserve state funds, diminish inconvenience to witnesses and public authorities, and avoid delays in bringing those accused of crime to trial.’’ State v. Gordon, 152 Ohio St.3d 528, 532, 2018-Ohio-259, 98 N.E.3d 251, ¶ 18, quoting Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123, 134, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968). However, Crim.R. 14 states: ‘If it appears that a defendant * * * is prejudiced by a joinder of offenses * * * for trial together, the court shall order an election or separate trial of counts * * * or provide such other relief as justice requires.’ Therefore, ‘a trial court should order separate trials pursuant to Crim.R. 14 if it appears the defendant is prejudiced by the joinder.’ Gordon, 152 Ohio St.3d 528, 533, 2018-Ohio-259, 98 N.E.3d 251, ¶ 20. A defendant claiming that a trial court erred in not severing charges ‘has the burden of affirmatively showing that his rights were prejudiced; he must furnish the trial court with sufficient information so that it [could] weigh the considerations favoring joinder against the defendant's right to a fair trial * * *.’ State v. Torres, 66 Ohio St.2d 340, 421 N.E.2d 1288 (1981), at the syllabus. ‘[C]laims of prejudice are less persuasive where the evidence is “amply sufficient to sustain each verdict, whether or not the indictments were tried together.” State v. Sapp, 105 Ohio St.3d 104, 2004-Ohio-7008, The State has two methods it may use to negate any claims of prejudice caused by joinder: (1) it may argue that it could have introduced evidence of the separate count under the “other acts” portion of Evid.R. 404(B) as recognized in State v. Lott, 51 Ohio St.3d 160, 163, 555 N.E.2d 293, or (2) show that the evidence of each crime joined at trial is simple and direct as was recognized in Torres, 66 Ohio St.2d 340, 344, 421 N.E.2d 1288 (1981), State v. Miller, 105 Ohio App.3d 679, 691-692, 664 N.E.2d 1309 (4th Dist. 1995). ‘‘[W]hen simple and direct evidence exists, an accused is not prejudiced by joinder regardless of the nonadmissibility of evidence of these crimes as ‘other acts’ under Evid.R. 404(B).’’ Id. at 691, quoting Lott, 51 Ohio St.3d at 163, 555 N.E.2d at 297. In Appellant’s one-page brief filed in the trial court, he alleged that ‘trying the two charges together would prejudice him in the eyes of the jury by portraying him in an unfavorable light.’ And in his appellate brief, Appellant alleges that the child pornography has no relevancy to the sexual assault allegations regarding A.C. He also alleges that the evidence supporting the child pornography was ‘speculative and weak.’ We find that Appellant did not satisfy his affirmative burden in the trial court showing that his rights were prejudiced because he didn’t furnish the trial court with ‘sufficient information so that it [could] weigh the considerations favoring joinder against the defendant's right to a fair trial.’ In his appeal, Appellant submits there is no relevancy between the illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented material and the sexual assault charges (rape, kidnapping). However, nowhere does he argue how trying all the charges together will result in prejudice. We also find that the cases Appellant cites (Slaven - court erred in joining sexual assault of two different children because evidence in one case would not be admissible in the other, and Clements - error for court to join unrelated charges of burglary and robbery in the same trial) are not particularly persuasive to the particular facts of this case. Accordingly, we find that Appellant has failed his burden of ‘affirmatively showing that his rights were prejudiced’ in the trial court or on appeal, so there is no plain error. Even assuming arguendo that trying count two with the remaining charges did result in prejudice, because there is evidence ‘amply sufficient to sustain each verdict, whether or not the indictments were tried together,’ Appellant’s claim of prejudice from trying the sexual assault claims with the illegal use of nudity-oriented material is less persuasive. _Sapp_, 105 Ohio St.3d at ¶ 73.

State v. Morris, 132 Ohio St.3d 337, 2012-Ohio-2407, syllabus. 'Appeals of such decisions are considered by an appellate court under an abuse-of-discretion standard of review.' Id. 'Abuse of discretion' has been described as including a ruling that lacks a'sound reasoning process.' Id. at ¶ 14, quoting AAAA Ents., Inc. v. River Place Community Urban Redevelopment Corp., 50 Ohio St.3d 157, 161 (1990). See also State v. Brady, 119 Ohio St.3d 375, 2008-Ohio-4493, ¶ 23. Appellant notes his trial counsel did not object to the physical abuse evidence and, thus, waived all but plain error. State v. Hanna, 95 Ohio St.3d 285, 2002-Ohio-2221, ¶ 84; Crim.R. 52(B). 'Generally, extrinsic acts may not be used to prove the inference that the accused acted in conformity with his other acts or that he has a propensity to act in such a manner.' State v. Smith, 49 Ohio St.3d 137, 140 (1990). However, Evid.R. 404(B) permits other-acts evidence for other purposes, including but not limited to the purposes identified in the rule. Id. See also Morris at ¶ 13. The rule provides that '[e]vidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.' Evid.R. 404(B). See also R.C. 2945.59. 'Another consideration permitting the admission of certain other-acts evidence is whether the other acts 'form part of the immediate background of the alleged act which forms the foundation of the crime charged in the indictment' and are 'inextricably related' to the crime.' Morris at ¶ 13, quoting State v. Curry, 43 Ohio St.2d 66, 73 (1975). Thus, '[e]vidence of other crimes may be presented when' those crimes tend 'logically to prove any element of the crime charged.' State v. Horsley, 10th Dist. No. 05AP-350, 2006-Ohio-1208, ¶ 24. To determine the admissibility of the other-acts evidence, a court must first 'consider whether the other acts evidence is relevant to making any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more or less probable than it would be without the evidence.' State v. Williams, 134 Ohio St.3d 521, 2012-Ohio-5695, ¶ 20, citing Evid.R. 401. Second, a court must 'consider whether evidence of the other crimes, wrongs, or acts is presented to prove the character of the accused in order to show activity in conformity therewith or whether the other acts evidence is presented for a legitimate purpose, such as those stated in Evid.R. 404(B).' Id. Finally, the court must 'consider whether the probative value of the other acts evidence is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.' *Id.*, citing Evid.R. 403. A number of the rape charges at issue charged appellant pursuant to R.C. 2907.02(A)(2), which provides that '[n]o person shall engage in sexual conduct with another when the offender purposely compels the other person to submit by force or threat of force.' 'Force' is defined as 'any violence, compulsion, or constraint physically exerted by any means upon or against a person or thing.' R.C. 2901.01(A)(1). To prove the force element of a sexual offense, the state must establish force beyond that force inherent in the crime itself. *State v. Griffith*, 10th Dist. No. 05AP-1042, 2006-Ohio-6983, ¶ 17, citing *State v. Dye*, 82 Ohio St.3d 323 (1998). However, the 'force and violence necessary to commit the crime of rape depends upon the age, size and strength of the parties and their relation to each other.' *State v. Eskridge*, 38 Ohio St.3d 56 (1988), paragraph one of the syllabus. In cases involving parents or stepparents sexually abusing their children, the force''need not be overt or physically brutal, but can be subtle and psychological. As long as it can be shown that the rape victim's will was overcome by fear or duress, the forcible element of rape can be established.''*Id.* at 58-59, quoting *State v. Fowler*, 27 Ohio App.3d 149, 154 (8th Dist.1985). *See also Griffith* at ¶ 17; *Dye* at 326. *Compare State v. Schaim*, 65 Ohio St.3d 51 (1992), paragraph one of the syllabus. Thus, evidence of a defendant's prior acts of violence may demonstrate why a victim's will was overcome by their fear of the defendant, and thereby establish the force element of a rape charge. *See State v. Williamson*, 8th Dist. No. 80982, 2002-Ohio-6503, ¶ 23 (noting the 'evidence of the physical violence that occurred in the household [was] relevant to and probative of the method of control used by defendant to rape and sexually abuse the victim'); *State v. Jordan*, 2d Dist. No. 26163, 2016-Ohio-603, ¶ 21 (holding that the 'other-acts evidence' of the defendant's violent acts was'relevant to the element of force'); *State v. Scott*, 5th Dist. No. 11CA80, 2012-Ohio-3482, ¶ 28-29 (noting the evidence indicating that the defendant killed the victim's baby sister 'was offered to show the victim's state of mind; * * * and why she was in fear of [defendant],' and thus was not 'improper propensity evidence, but instead tend[ed] to show an element of the crime [of rape], force'). N.F. explained he did not want to engage in the sexual acts with appellant, but stated he 'never questioned what' appellant told him to do, because if he questioned appellant that'results to physical violence or physical abuse.' (Tr. Vol. II 108.) Thus, the physical abuse evidence demonstrated N.F.'s will was overcome by his fear of appellant, and explained why N.F. did not resist appellant's demands for sexual activity. Additionally, during N.F.'s testimony, the court provided the jury with the following limiting instruction: Let me just advise you that I have permitted testimony on the direct examination of this witness dealing with alleged prior bad acts on behalf of the [appellant] in this case. I did not admit that evidence to show that [appellant], if he did commit a bad act before, he acted in conformance with that action with respect to [N.F.] and the matters that you are to decide, the sexual-related offenses. But I have permitted that to be introduced for the purpose of showing [N.F.'s] state of mind and whether he was fearful of [appellant]. So you can only consider it for that purpose and that purpose only. (Tr. Vol. II at 69-70.) We presume the jury followed the court's instruction. State v. Jones, 135 Ohio St.3d 10, 2012-Ohio-5677, ¶ 194. Appellant argues the trial court's failure to reiterate the limiting instruction when other witnesses testified to the physical abuse, or to reiterate the instruction in the final jury instructions, amounts to plain error. Although 'the failure to give any limiting instruction constitutes plain error,' here the trial court did provide the jury with a limiting instruction the first time the other-acts evidence was presented. State v. Shaw, 2d Dist. No. 21880, 2008-Ohio-1317, ¶ 13, quoting State v. Tisdale, 2d Dist.

The evidence of physical abuse was relevant to a fact of consequence, as it established the force element of the rape charges. Williams at ¶ 20. The evidence was not presented to prove appellant acted in conformity therewith, and the court instructed the jury the evidence was not to be used for that purpose. Id. The probative value of the evidence was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, and any danger of unfair prejudice was reduced by the court's limiting instruction. Id. at ¶ 24. Appellant further argues that, even if N.F.'s testimony of the physical abuse was admissible, the additional evidence from L.A., C.A.W., and children services caseworkers regarding the physical abuse deprived him of a fair trial. However, appellant testified N.F. had lied about all of the sexual abuse allegations. The testimony from the other witnesses corroborated N.F.'s testimony regarding the physical abuse and, thus, served to bolster N.F.'s credibility. Evidence which impeaches or bolsters witness credibility 'is of consequence to the action because it might determine whether the jury believes a particular witness.' State v. Moore, 40 Ohio St.3d 63, 65 (1988). Moreover, appellant admitted his methods of disciplining N.F. constituted physical abuse. In closing, defense counsel relied on the fact that appellant 'freely told' the jury that 'his methods of disciplining [N.F.] were not good,' to bolster appellant's credibility. (Tr. Vol. V at 94.) The defense also argued the years of physical abuse, coupled with appellant cutting N.F. off financially, provided N.F. with the motivation to fabricate the sexual abuse allegations against appellant. (See Tr. Vol. V at 94-95.) To the extent that some of the physical abuse evidence may have been unnecessarily cumulative, the admission of such evidence amounts to harmless error. A defendant is entitled to a fair trial, not a perfect one. State v. Williams, 38 Ohio St.3d 346, 349 (1988). 'The harmless-error doctrine recognizes the principle that the central purpose of a criminal trial is to decide the factual question of the defendant's guilt or innocence,' and thus focuses 'on the underlying fairness of the trial rather than on the virtually inevitable presence of immaterial error.' Id. An error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt when the remaining evidence, standing alone, constitutes overwhelming proof of defendant's guilt. Id. See also State v. Tucker, 10th Dist. No. 00AP-670, 2002-Ohio-3274, ¶ 44; Morris at ¶ 32; Crim.R. 52(A). The evidence of the crimes for which the jury returned guilty verdicts was considerable. In addition to N.F.'s detailed description of each sexual act, L.A. testified to the sexual activity that occurred between herself, N.F., and appellant, and C.A.W. provided circumstantial evidence that sexual activity occurred between appellant, L.A., and N.F. Accordingly, as the record contains overwhelming evidence of appellant's guilt on the sex crimes, any error in the admission of physical abuse evidence was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n}\n```"}

See also Morris at ¶ 13. The rule provides that '[e]vidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith.

See also R.C. 2945.59. 'Another consideration permitting the admission of certain other-acts evidence is whether the other acts 'form part of the immediate background of the alleged act which forms the foundation of the crime charged in the indictment' and are 'inextricably related' to the crime.' Morris at ¶ 13, quoting State v. Curry, 43 Ohio St.2d 66, 73 (1975). Thus, '[e]vidence of other crimes may be presented when' those crimes tend 'logically to prove any element of the crime charged.' State v. Horsley, 10th Dist. No. 05AP-350, 2006-Ohio-1208, ¶ 24. To determine the admissibility of the other-acts evidence, a court must first 'consider whether the other acts evidence is relevant to making any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more or less probable than it would be without the evidence.' State v. Williams, 134 Ohio St.3d 521, 2012-Ohio-5695, ¶ 20, citing Evid.R. 401. Second, a court must 'consider whether evidence of the other crimes, wrongs, or acts is presented to prove the character of the accused in order to show activity in conformity therewith or whether the other acts evidence is presented for a legitimate purpose, such as those stated in Evid.R. 404(B).' Id. Finally, the court must 'consider whether the probative value of the other acts evidence is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.' *Id.*, citing Evid.R. 403. A number of the rape charges at issue charged appellant pursuant to R.C. 2907.02(A)(2), which provides that '[n]o person shall engage in sexual conduct with another when the offender purposely compels the other person to submit by force or threat of force.' 'Force' is defined as 'any violence, compulsion, or constraint physically exerted by any means upon or against a person or thing.' R.C. 2901.01(A)(1). To prove the force element of a sexual offense, the state must establish force beyond that force inherent in the crime itself. *State v. Griffith*, 10th Dist. No. 05AP-1042, 2006-Ohio-6983, ¶ 17, citing *State v. Dye*, 82 Ohio St.3d 323 (1998). However, the 'force and violence necessary to commit the crime of rape depends upon the age, size and strength of the parties and their relation to each other.' *State v. Eskridge*, 38 Ohio St.3d 56 (1988), paragraph one of the syllabus. In cases involving parents or stepparents sexually abusing their children, the force''need not be overt or physically brutal, but can be subtle and psychological. As long as it can be shown that the rape victim's will was overcome by fear or duress, the forcible element of rape can be established.''*Id.* at 58-59, quoting *State v. Fowler*, 27 Ohio App.3d 149, 154 (8th Dist.1985). *See also Griffith* at ¶ 17; *Dye* at 326. *Compare State v. Schaim*, 65 Ohio St.3d 51 (1992), paragraph one of the syllabus. Thus, evidence of a defendant's prior acts of violence may demonstrate why a victim's will was overcome by their fear of the defendant, and thereby establish the force element of a rape charge. *See State v. Williamson*, 8th Dist. No. 80982, 2002-Ohio-6503, ¶ 23 (noting the 'evidence of the physical violence that occurred in the household [was] relevant to and probative of the method of control used by defendant to rape and sexually abuse the victim'); *State v. Jordan*, 2d Dist. No. 26163, 2016-Ohio-603, ¶ 21 (holding that the 'other-acts evidence' of the defendant's violent acts was'relevant to the element of force'); *State v. Scott*, 5th Dist. No. 11CA80, 2012-Ohio-3482, ¶ 28-29 (noting the evidence indicating that the defendant killed the victim's baby sister 'was offered to show the victim's state of mind; * * * and why she was in fear of [defendant],' and thus was not 'improper propensity evidence, but instead tend[ed] to show an element of the crime [of rape], force'). N.F. explained he did not want to engage in the sexual acts with appellant, but stated he 'never questioned what' appellant told him to do, because if he questioned appellant that'results to physical violence or physical abuse.' (Tr. Vol. II 108.) Thus, the physical abuse evidence demonstrated N.F.'s will was overcome by his fear of appellant, and explained why N.F. did not resist appellant's demands for sexual activity. Additionally, during N.F.'s testimony, the court provided the jury with the following limiting instruction: Let me just advise you that I have permitted testimony on the direct examination of this witness dealing with alleged prior bad acts on behalf of the [appellant] in this case. I did not admit that evidence to show that [appellant], if he did commit a bad act before, he acted in conformance with that action with respect to [N.F.] and the matters that you are to decide, the sexual-related offenses. But I have permitted that to be introduced for the purpose of showing [N.F.'s] state of mind and whether he was fearful of [appellant]. So you can only consider it for that purpose and that purpose only. (Tr. Vol. II at 69-70.) We presume the jury followed the court's instruction. State v. Jones, 135 Ohio St.3d 10, 2012-Ohio-5677, ¶ 194. Appellant argues the trial court's failure to reiterate the limiting instruction when other witnesses testified to the physical abuse, or to reiterate the instruction in the final jury instructions, amounts to plain error. Although 'the failure to give any limiting instruction constitutes plain error,' here the trial court did provide the jury with a limiting instruction the first time the other-acts evidence was presented. State v. Shaw, 2d Dist. No. 21880, 2008-Ohio-1317, ¶ 13, quoting State v. Tisdale, 2d Dist.

Jordan*, 2d Dist. No. 26163, 2016-Ohio-603, ¶ 21 (holding that the 'other-acts evidence' of the defendant's violent acts was'relevant to the element of force'); *State v. Scott*, 5th Dist. No. 11CA80, 2012-Ohio-3482, ¶ 28-29 (noting the evidence indicating that the defendant killed the victim's baby sister 'was offered to show the victim's state of mind; * * * and why she was in fear of [defendant],' and thus was not 'improper propensity evidence, but instead tend[ed] to show an element of the crime [of rape], force'). N.F. explained he did not want to engage in the sexual acts with appellant, but stated he 'never questioned what' appellant told him to do, because if he questioned appellant that'results to physical violence or physical abuse.' (Tr. Vol. II 108.) Thus, the physical abuse evidence demonstrated N.F.'s will was overcome by his fear of appellant, and explained why N.F. did not resist appellant's demands for sexual activity. Additionally, during N.F.'s testimony, the court provided the jury with the following limiting instruction: Let me just advise you that I have permitted testimony on the direct examination of this witness dealing with alleged prior bad acts on behalf of the [appellant] in this case. I did not admit that evidence to show that [appellant], if he did commit a bad act before, he acted in conformance with that action with respect to [N.F.] and the matters that you are to decide, the sexual-related offenses. But I have permitted that to be introduced for the purpose of showing [N.F.'s] state of mind and whether he was fearful of [appellant]. So you can only consider it for that purpose and that purpose only. (Tr. Vol. II at 69-70.) We presume the jury followed the court's instruction. State v. Jones, 135 Ohio St.3d 10, 2012-Ohio-5677, ¶ 194. Appellant argues the trial court's failure to reiterate the limiting instruction when other witnesses testified to the physical abuse, or to reiterate the instruction in the final jury instructions, amounts to plain error. Although 'the failure to give any limiting instruction constitutes plain error,' here the trial court did provide the jury with a limiting instruction the first time the other-acts evidence was presented. State v. Shaw, 2d Dist. No. 21880, 2008-Ohio-1317, ¶ 13, quoting State v. Tisdale, 2d Dist. No. 19346, 2003-Ohio-4209, ¶ 47 (noting that''[t]he limiting instruction should be given at the time the \"other acts\" evidence is received' \"). Accordingly, we do not find plain error. The evidence of physical abuse was relevant to a fact of consequence, as it established the force element of the rape charges. Williams at ¶ 20. The evidence was not presented to prove appellant acted in conformity therewith, and the court instructed the jury the evidence was not to be used for that purpose. Id. The probative value of the evidence was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, and any danger of unfair prejudice was reduced by the court's limiting instruction. Id. at ¶ 24. Appellant further argues that, even if N.F.'s testimony of the physical abuse was admissible, the additional evidence from L.A., C.A.W., and children services caseworkers regarding the physical abuse deprived him of a fair trial. However, appellant testified N.F. had lied about all of the sexual abuse allegations. The testimony from the other witnesses corroborated N.F.'s testimony regarding the physical abuse and, thus, served to bolster N.F.'s credibility. Evidence which impeaches or bolsters witness credibility 'is of consequence to the action because it might determine whether the jury believes a particular witness.' State v. Moore, 40 Ohio St.3d 63, 65 (1988). Moreover, appellant admitted his methods of disciplining N.F. constituted physical abuse. In closing, defense counsel relied on the fact that appellant 'freely told' the jury that 'his methods of disciplining [N.F.] were not good,' to bolster appellant's credibility. (Tr. Vol. V at 94.) The defense also argued the years of physical abuse, coupled with appellant cutting N.F. off financially, provided N.F. with the motivation to fabricate the sexual abuse allegations against appellant. (See Tr. Vol. V at 94-95.) To the extent that some of the physical abuse evidence may have been unnecessarily cumulative, the admission of such evidence amounts to harmless error. A defendant is entitled to a fair trial, not a perfect one. State v. Williams, 38 Ohio St.3d 346, 349 (1988). 'The harmless-error doctrine recognizes the principle that the central purpose of a criminal trial is to decide the factual question of the defendant's guilt or innocence,' and thus focuses 'on the underlying fairness of the trial rather than on the virtually inevitable presence of immaterial error.' Id. An error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt when the remaining evidence, standing alone, constitutes overwhelming proof of defendant's guilt. Id. See also State v. Tucker, 10th Dist. No. 00AP-670, 2002-Ohio-3274, ¶ 44; Morris at ¶ 32; Crim.R. 52(A). The evidence of the crimes for which the jury returned guilty verdicts was considerable. In addition to N.F.'s detailed description of each sexual act, L.A. testified to the sexual activity that occurred between herself, N.F., and appellant, and C.A.W. provided circumstantial evidence that sexual activity occurred between appellant, L.A., and N.F. Accordingly, as the record contains overwhelming evidence of appellant's guilt on the sex crimes, any error in the admission of physical abuse evidence was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n}\n```"}

But this begs two questions—the materiality of the evidence and state action.\\n\\n‘Evidence is constitutionally material when it possesses ‘an exculpatory value that was apparent before the evidence was destroyed, and [is] of such a nature that the defendant would be unable to obtain comparable evidence by other reasonably available means.’ ’ State v.

If the evidence in question is only potentially useful, however, a defendant cannot show a due-process violation without first demonstrating bad faith on the state’s behalf. State v. Rice, 1st Dist. Hamilton Nos. C-160668, C-160669 and C-160670, 2017-Ohio-9114, ¶ 13. The defendant bears the burden to show the exculpatory nature of the evidence. *State v. Benson*, 152 Ohio App.3d 495, 2003-Ohio-1944, 788 N.E.2d 693, ¶11 (1st Dist.).\\n\\nWith this standard in mind, Mr. Fornshell cannot satisfy his burden of demonstrating that the full video footage from the Madeira Half Price Books was materially exculpatory. The parties do not dispute that the incident occurred in the self-help section of the store, and that no video camera captured that portion of the store. Several witnesses, however, vouched for the likelihood of children in the store at the time of the incident. One Half Price Books employee testified that children were in the store. The victim, Ms. Velez, echoed the point, confirming that there were ‘absolutely’ people under the age of 18 in the store at the time of the incident, and that she ‘probably’ encountered children between the incident and her walk to report it. The store manager testified that it is possible to see through the shelves in the self-help area from other sections of the store, including the children’s section, to which it is adjacent. She also testified that the incident occurred on one of their biggest sale days of the year, and that they sell ‘lots’ of toys (attracting children and their parents alike). The manager personally viewed all of the surveillance video between 7:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m. the evening of the incident and identified several distinct, potential minors in the store at or just before the time Mr. Fornshell entered the store.\\n\\nMr. Fornshell nevertheless posits that the full store footage could have isolated minors entering and exiting while he was in the store. But in view of the litany of evidence above (and in light of our statutory analysis below), we do not believe that this would exculpate Mr. Fornshell. The jury was shown footage of likely minors entering the Madeira store before Mr. Fornshell arrived—consistent with the store manager’s testimony. This evidence undercuts his contention that the full video footage would have been exculpatory. Admittedly, it can often be difficult to establish that evidence that no longer exists is exculpatory, but based on the other available evidence in the record here, we cannot conclude that Mr. Fornshell can make such a showing.\\n\\nWith the evidence only potentially useful, this obligates Mr. Fornshell to establish bad faith on the state’s part to succeed with a due-process claim. But this case involves a third-party (not acting on behalf of the state) disposing of evidence, rendering it more difficult for Mr. Fornshell to connect the destruction of evidence to bad faith on the part of the state.\\n\\nOhio law generally recognizes that the state need not gather evidence on the defendant’s behalf (but when it does, that is a different story):\\n\\nAlthough we agree that is not proper for a law enforcement agency to suppress evidence, we also conclude that it is not the agency’s obligation to engage in affirmation action in gathering evidence which an accused might feel necessary to his defense. The accused must protect his own interests. It is only when overzealous officials deny that opportunity can it be said that he is deprived of due process by state action.\\n\\nCity of Kettering v. Baker, 42 Ohio St.2d 351, 354-355, 328 N.E.2d 805 (1975).\\n\\n‘[I]t is not the responsibility of the state to obtain evidence that the defendant can obtain on his own.’ ’ State v. Dinardo, 11th Dist. Lake No. 2013-L-108, 2015-Ohio-1062, ¶ 11.\\n\\nMr. Fornshell made a demand upon the prosecuting attorney for videos at the scene and around the time of the arrest, but we cannot construe such a request to encompass evidence beyond the state’s control. Mr. Fornshell did not subpoena the Madeira Half Price Books, nor has he pointed to any authority for the proposition that the *Brady* doctrine would require the state to secure evidence not in its possession from third parties. Without state action, the panoply of constitutional protections generally does not apply. *Bouquett v. St. Elizabeth Corp.*, 43 Ohio St.3d 50, 53, 538 N.E.2d 113 (1989) (appellee required to show state action to ‘warrant the constitutional protection of due process’).\\n\\nWhile we can imagine finding bad faith in a scenario where the state prevented a defendant from securing evidence from a third-party, that is not the case here, and Mr. Fornshell has failed to offer proof otherwise of bad faith. Detective Vogel testified that he promptly asked Half Price books for all pertinent footage; that he requested ‘the entire video,’ but was told this was nearly impossible. Because the clips that he received substantiated the victim’s claims, he did not persist for the entire video footage. Mr. Fornshell argues that this nonchalance rises to the level of bad faith. But ‘[b]ad faith implies something more than bad judgment or negligence,’ and we do not see anything more serious on the record before us. *See State v. Acosta*, 1st Dist. Hamilton Nos.

Baker, 42 Ohio St.2d 351, 354-355, 328 N.E.2d 805 (1975).\\n\\n‘[I]t is not the responsibility of the state to obtain evidence that the defendant can obtain on his own.’ ’ State v. Dinardo, 11th Dist. Lake No. 2013-L-108, 2015-Ohio-1062, ¶ 11.\\n\\nMr. Fornshell made a demand upon the prosecuting attorney for videos at the scene and around the time of the arrest, but we cannot construe such a request to encompass evidence beyond the state’s control. Mr. Fornshell did not subpoena the Madeira Half Price Books, nor has he pointed to any authority for the proposition that the *Brady* doctrine would require the state to secure evidence not in its possession from third parties. Without state action, the panoply of constitutional protections generally does not apply. *Bouquett v. St. Elizabeth Corp.*, 43 Ohio St.3d 50, 53, 538 N.E.2d 113 (1989) (appellee required to show state action to ‘warrant the constitutional protection of due process’).\\n\\nWhile we can imagine finding bad faith in a scenario where the state prevented a defendant from securing evidence from a third-party, that is not the case here, and Mr. Fornshell has failed to offer proof otherwise of bad faith. Detective Vogel testified that he promptly asked Half Price books for all pertinent footage; that he requested ‘the entire video,’ but was told this was nearly impossible. Because the clips that he received substantiated the victim’s claims, he did not persist for the entire video footage. Mr. Fornshell argues that this nonchalance rises to the level of bad faith. But ‘[b]ad faith implies something more than bad judgment or negligence,’ and we do not see anything more serious on the record before us. *See State v. Acosta*, 1st Dist. Hamilton Nos. C-020767, C-020768, C-020769, C-020770 and C-020771, 2003-Ohio-6503, ¶9.\\n\\nWithout a showing that the evidence at issue was materially exculpatory or that the state acted in bad faith, (let alone a showing of state action), we overrule Mr. Fornshell’s first assignment of error.\"\n}\n```"}

Manifest Weight and Sufficiency of Evidence", "discussion": "```json\n{\n  \"discussion\": \"Miller argues in his first two assignments of error that his convictions were against the manifest weight of the evidence and were not supported by sufficient evidence. When reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence underlying a criminal conviction, an appellate court examines the evidence to determine whether such evidence, if believed, would support a conviction. The relevant inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt. A manifest weight of the evidence challenge examines the 'inclination of the greater amount of credible evidence, offered at a trial, to support one side of the issue rather than the other.' To determine whether a conviction is against the manifest weight of the evidence, the reviewing court must look at the entire record, weigh the evidence and all reasonable inferences, consider the credibility of the witnesses, and determine whether in resolving the conflicts in the evidence, the trier of fact clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered. Questions regarding witness credibility and weight of the evidence are primarily matters for the trier of fact to decide since the trier of fact is in the best position to judge the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be given the evidence. The question upon review is whether in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the jury clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed. Therefore, an appellate court will overturn a conviction due to the manifest weight of the evidence only in extraordinary circumstances when the evidence presented at trial weighs heavily in favor of acquittal. Miller was convicted of inducing panic in violation of R.C. 2917.31(A)(3)(c), which prohibits one from causing serious public inconvenience or alarm by committing an offense with reckless disregard of the likelihood that its commission will cause serious public inconvenience or alarm. If economic harm results from inducing panic and the amount is more than $7,500 but less than $150,000, the charge is a felony of the fourth degree. Miller was also convicted of endangering children in violation of R.C. 2919.22(A), which prohibits a parent of a child under the age of 21 from creating 'a substantial risk to the health or safety of the child, by violating a duty of care, protection, or support.' After reviewing the record, we find that Miller's convictions were supported by sufficient evidence and were not against the manifest weight of the evidence. At trial, the state presented testimony from law enforcement officers that the community suffered serious inconvenience and alarm. Law enforcement officers cordoned off a large area surrounding the house and instructed neighbors not to leave their houses for over eight hours. The road leading to the house was closed and vehicular traffic, including school busses, had to be rerouted to avoid the area. The firearm specification was also supported by evidence that Sara told the police dispatcher that Miller had the firearm 'on him' at the time of the offense. Miller further admitted to police that he had control of the firearm both before and after the standoff began, and the record is undisputed that officers located the loaded firearm after Miller finally left the house. The evidence also established that the rental house incurred damage due to the standoff and the use of tear gas to flush out Miller. This damage exceeded $11,000.1 Because of Miller’s actions that resulted in damage to the house, the landlord was unable to rent the house for several months, incurring thousands of dollars in lost compensation. The county was also forced to expend funds for law enforcement and emergency personnel who responded to the call. The total amount of damage exceeded the necessary $7,500 threshold. While Miller claims that this damage did not occur to the alleged victims, Sara or their daughter, the statute defining economic harm does not require such a limited application. According to R.C. 2917.39(E)(1), economic harm means any of the following, (a) All direct, incidental, and consequential pecuniary harm suffered by a victim as a result of criminal conduct. 'Economic harm' as described in this division includes, but is not limited to, all of the following: (i) All wages, salaries, or other compensation lost as a result of the criminal conduct; (ii) The cost of all wages, salaries, or other compensation paid to employees for time those employees are prevented from working as a result of the criminal conduct; (iii) The overhead costs incurred for the time that a business is shut down as a result of the criminal conduct; (iv) The loss of value to tangible or intangible property that was damaged as a result of the criminal conduct. (b) All costs incurred by the state or any political subdivision as a result of, or in making any response to, the criminal conduct that constituted the violation of this section or section 2917.32 of the Revised Code, including, but not limited to, all costs so incurred by any law enforcement officers, firefighters, rescue personnel, or emergency medical services personnel of the state or the political subdivision. Thus, the statute provides for economic harm to 'a victim' rather than any one specific victim of the underlying criminal act that results in damage to property. As a result of Miller's conduct, the rental house incurred damage, regardless of the fact that it was owned by someone other than Sara or her daughter. The record also demonstrates that Miller's conviction for child endangerment was supported by the manifest weight and sufficiency of evidence. Miller argues that his child was not harmed on the day of the incident and that she was never in substantial risk of harm. We disagree. The state presented evidence that at the time of the incident, the child was present in the house as events began and continued to unfold. These events included methamphetamine possession and use, as well as periods of intense arguing between Sara and Miller. The child was also present when Sara told the dispatcher that Miller had the firearm 'on him.' When Sara and the child ran from the house, the child was wearing her pajamas, but no coat, on a morning with temperatures in the 40-degree range. The record is undisputed that Sara held the child as she exited the house upon the police's arrival and the child was subjected to the dangerous circumstances as police began their standoff with an armed Miller. The jury was in the best position to weigh the evidence regarding what risk the circumstances posed the child's health and safety, and we do not find that the jury clearly lost its way or created a manifest miscarriage of justice in finding that Miller's conduct constituted child endangering.

Defense counsel asked the court to note a continuing objection to the evidence, and the court said it would. The decision was a preliminary ruling before the actual presentation of the evidence during the trial testimony where it could be adjudged in context upon proper objection. The preliminary issue presented in a motion in limine must be renewed at trial when the evidence is actually presented or the argument made therein is waived for purposes of appeal. State v. Hill, 75 Ohio St.3d 195, 202-203, 661 N.E.2d 1068 (1996). On appeal, Appellant claims the court improperly allowed the state to present other acts evidence to demonstrate his propensity for assaulting his wife and to show he acted in conformity with his character. He says the state used the evidence to paint a picture that it was only a matter of time before he killed his wife. He contests the following testimony on other acts. Appellant’s sister-in-law was asked about the relationship between Appellant and the victim. She said it was sometimes loving but they would argue and fight, answering in the affirmative when asked if the relationship ever got physical. There was no objection entered. If a timely objection was lacking, then the appellant must not only show an error occurred and the error was obvious, but he must also show it affected the outcome of the trial. State v. Graham, __ Ohio St.3d __, 2020-Ohio-6700 at ¶ 93 (finding error in admitting other acts evidence but refusing to find plain error as the error did not affect the outcome of trial), citing State v. Barnes, 94 Ohio St.3d 21, 27, 759 N.E.2d 1240 (2002). The general, non-specific testimony of Appellant’s sister-in-law would not have affected Appellant’s substantial rights under the circumstances of this case. The real focus is on the other acts testimony of the victim’s sister, the victim’s child, and on statements Appellant made to the detective. The victim’s sister testified she first realized Appellant was abusive when she looked out her door and saw the victim “fly across the street, like her body.” She did not see the actual physical motion by which Appellant caused this to occur, but she yelled at him not to put his hands on her sister and he apologized. Another time, she intervened when Appellant was “dragging [the victim] up and down the street.” In the past, she observed the victim with injuries such as a broken nose, teeth, and fingers. Over objection, the victim’s sister testified: the victim told her Appellant caused these injuries; the victim told the hospital staff she was injured in a fall; and the staff said the victim’s body could not take much more. The victim’s child testified: she asked Appellant if he would stop hitting her mother months before the victim’s death; he said he would; and the situation got worse. She stated she witnessed Appellant’s prior acts of punching, hitting, throwing, and kicking the victim; she associated the behavior as occurring after Appellant drank liquor. The child said he would threaten the victim by stating: “I’m gonna hurt you if you don’t stop talking.” The child mentioned calling her step-brother on the night at issue because “his mom went through it, so obviously I think he would know what to do” (not necessarily referring to Appellant). There were no objections during these portions of the child’s testimony. The detective testified he asked Appellant about past violence in the relationship. Over objection, the detective said Appellant “initially downplayed it, but ultimately admitted to having some physical altercations” with the victim in the past. Appellant said one such altercation resulted in “a cut over her eye” which occurred when he “grabbed her and she slipped and fell and hit her eye”; Appellant also acknowledged the victim “has lied for him in the past when they have gone to the hospital.” “Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.” Evid.R. 404(B). “Thus, while evidence showing the defendant’s character or propensity to commit crimes or acts is forbidden, evidence of other acts is admissible when the evidence is probative of a separate, nonpropensity-based issue. State v. Hartman, 161 Ohio St.3d 214, 2020-Ohio-4440, 161 N.E.3d 651, ¶ 22. In general, evidence is relevant if it tends “to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination * * * more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.” Evid.R. 401. *See also Hartman*, 161 Ohio St.3d 214 at ¶ 24; Evid.R. 402 (“Evidence which is not relevant is not admissible.”). The relevancy determination in this context asks “whether the evidence is relevant to the particular purpose for which it is offered” which must be one other than character or propensity. *Hartman*, 161 Ohio St.3d 214 at ¶ 26. Evid.R. 404(B) contains a “nonexhaustive list of the permissible nonpropensity purposes for which other-acts evidence may be introduced.” *Id.* at ¶ 26. “The nonpropensity purpose for which the evidence is offered must go to a'material' issue that is actually in dispute between the parties.” *Id.* at ¶ 27. Also, evidence of similar acts “is relevant only if the jury can reasonably conclude that the act occurred and that the defendant was the actor.” *Id.* at ¶ 28. If the evidence is not presented for character and has a permissible purpose under Evid.R. 404(B), then the trial court uses its discretion to determine whether the probative value “is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, of confusion of the issues, or of misleading the jury.” *Id.* at ¶ 29-30, citing Evid.R. 403(A). The probative value and the unfairness of any prejudice can depend on the degree to which the fact is truly in dispute and whether it can be shown with alternative evidence. *Id.* at ¶ 31-32. First, we address Appellant’s claim there was no “substantial proof” he committed the other acts. *Hartman*, 161 Ohio St.3d 214 at ¶ 28. He notes the testimony was not corroborated with a police report or hospital record. “It is not essential to the admissibility of evidence regarding prior incidents that such incidents were either reported to police officials by the victim or resulted in a conviction.” *State v. Jones*, 7th Dist. Mahoning No. 95 C.A. 98 (June 26, 1998) (admitting testimony on an incident where the defendant held his former wife hostage with a rifle ten years prior to the prosecution for the death of his current wife where the defendant claimed the shooting was accidental while they were fighting over a gun), citing *State v. Armstrong*, 74 Ohio App.3d 732, 600 N.E.2d 690 (2d Dist.1991). Here, the “jury can reasonably conclude that the act occurred and that the defendant was the actor.” *See Hartman*, 161 Ohio St.3d 214 at ¶ 28. The jury could evaluate the credibility of the victim’s sister and the victim’s child who claimed to have witnessed certain acts. Moreover, the detective testified as to Appellant’s own admissions about: prior physical arguments, the victim lying for him at the hospital in the past, and a specific incident where the victim ended up with a head wound and Appellant claimed she slipped and fell during a fight. Second, we address Appellant’s argument that other acts evidence cannot be admitted for a use permitted by Evid.R. 404(B) unless the defendant specifically introduced evidence at trial on a defense related to a permissible use of other acts evidence. Appellant points out the non-propensity purpose for admitting the other acts evidence must relate to a material issue “actually in dispute.” *See Hartman*, 161 Ohio St.3d 214 at ¶ 27. He complains the prosecution introduced the defendant’s statement (that the victim was injured due to an accidental fall) and used this to assert a permissible use under Evid.R. 404(B) without waiting to see if he would be opening the door to the issue. As the trial court ruled at the motion in limine hearing, the permissible uses of other acts evidence in Evid.R. 404(B) do not only apply when a defendant takes the stand or presents witnesses. See generally State v. Hunter, 131 Ohio St.3d 67, 2011-Ohio-6524, 960 N.E.2d 955, ¶ 20, 22, 30 (where the defendant told the police the child fell down the stairs and presented no guilt phase witnesses, the Court upheld the decision to admit evidence on prior incidents of injury to the child which the defendant had reported were a result of his falling while holding the child). We note a defendant often does not present witnesses because the state’s witnesses have the information relevant to defending the case, defendants rarely testify, and there is no formal notice a defendant must file disclosing every defense theory to the state. Also, the mere decision to forgo a lengthy opening statement does not bar the state from establishing there is an issue surrounding a permissible use of other acts evidence. The defendant’s own pretrial statements can be used by the state to show the lack of mistake or accident is a material issue in the case. See id. Here, Appellant repeatedly claimed the victim was injured at home as a result of an accident where she fell in a bedroom while running (from him after a night of physical violence as captured on video and subsequently witnessed by the victim’s twelve-year-old child). The state’s first two witnesses (Appellant’s brother and sister-in-law) testified to Appellant’s claim at the scene while the victim was lying on the floor dying. After summoning them and instead of calling 911, Appellant told them the victim was injured when she slipped and fell while running into a bedroom (to pack and leave the house). Appellant also told this story to the police when he was interviewed on the day the victim was hospitalized, and the detective testified to Appellant’s claim. Appellant also suggested to the detective he may have elbowed the victim in the face by mistake while putting her in “a bearhug.” And, Appellant told the victim’s sister he did not put his hands on the victim. Moreover, defense counsel asked the victim’s child whether her mother got aggressive when she drank alcohol, eliciting a statement that the victim would sometimes hit Appellant (but only if he hit her first). Defense counsel cross-examined the neurosurgeon on whether the brain trauma could have resulted from a fall, whether a seizure could cause damage to the brain, and whether the bouncing of a head on the floor during a seizure could cause problems. (Tr. 432). He also asked the forensic pathologist whether the trauma to the victim’s brain could have occurred from just one impact. (Tr. 472). In closing arguments, defense counsel mentioned the testimony stating the victim appeared to be having a seizure. He also said the testimony showed the victim’s injuries could have been sustained “by one fall” while noting she did not appear seriously injured after the punches that were witnessed. (Tr. 580-581). Counsel also urged there was no evidence showing Appellant had intent to purposely cause the death of his wife. (Tr. 581). Appellant next suggests the evidence was not material to the absence of mistake or accident exception. The state urges the absence of mistake or accident as to the cause of the victim’s death and his purpose (intent) were material issues actually in dispute. The state points out to negate a defendant's claim of mistake or accident, the prosecution can use similar incidents to show the act in dispute was not inadvertent, accidental, involuntary, or lacking in guilty knowledge. Hartman, 161 Ohio St.3d 214 at ¶ 52. It is argued the case at bar implicates both categories discussed by Hartman in explaining the two main ways a defendant raises a claim of accident: (1) a statement disputing whether a criminal act occurred at all or (2) a statement disputing the act was committed with criminal intent. Id. at ¶ 52-53. These examples do not require the past incidents to be close in time to the current incident. This court has applied Ohio Supreme Court precedent allowing evidence of prior acts of domestic violence to show motive, intent, and absence of mistake or accident when the defendant later kills the victim. State v. Ash, 2018-Ohio-1139, 108 N.E.3d 1115, ¶ 67 (7th Dist.) (even an incident temporally removed from the incident in question can be admitted under an exception to show the tumultuous and strained relationship), citing State v. Nields, 93 Ohio St.3d 6, 10, 22, 752 N.E.2d 859 (2001). See also Jones, 7th Dist. No. 95 C.A. 98 (admissible other acts testimony on an incident with former wife ten years before the defendant’s current wife was allegedly accidentally shot) In a death penalty case, the defendant said his child fell down the basement steps. The Supreme Court upheld the admission of testimony about two prior hospital visits where the defendant claimed the child was injured when the defendant fell while holding the child. State v. Hunter, 131 Ohio St.3d 67, 2011-Ohio-6524, 960 N.E.2d 955, ¶ 16-17, 109-111. “Such evidence was particularly relevant because it showed that [the defendant’s] claim that [the child] died during an accidental fall was probably untrue. Based on this evidence, the panel could reasonably infer that [the defendant] acted purposefully in killing [the child].” Id. at ¶ 114. Here, the similar incidents involved the same victim. Appellant claimed no criminal act caused the victim’s death as she died after slipping and falling. See Hartman, 161 Ohio St.3d 214 at ¶ 52. He also claimed some prior physical injuries that night were mistakenly or accidentally inflicted and certain blows to the victim’s head did not cause her death or were not struck with purpose to cause her death. See id. at ¶ 53. Furthermore, when apologizing to the victim’s child soon after the death, he generally claimed he “didn’t mean to do it.” Notably, Hunter involved the defendant’s claim the victim died after suffering an accident by falling; the defendant’s story as to how the child died did not involve a claim he accidentally injured the child. Similarly, the first qualifying example in Hartman involved a defendant’s claim that something caused the victim’s death naturally rather than a claim he accidentally caused it. This concept is on point as to Appellant’s story of the victim’s death (the victim fell when she was running away from him to pack clothes and leave him), and this story was similar to the story Appellant told the detective about the victim’s past head injury (she received a cut above her eye during their fight when he grabbed her and she fell). It also supports the testimony of the victim’s sister confirming Appellant’s statement to the detective that the victim previously lied to cover for him by saying she fell. The contested testimony was not presented as character or propensity evidence but was relevant to an exception to the other acts exclusion which was in material dispute. Next, Appellant contends “the probative value [of the other acts evidence] is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, of confusion of the issues, or of misleading the jury” and was required to be excluded under Evid.R. 403(A). There was no indication the evidence would cause confusion or mislead the jury. The state points out the evidence was highly probative to show the victim’s various injuries were not caused by a mistake or accident and the death was caused with specific intent. It was reasonable to find “under the circumstances, the detailed facts of the charged and uncharged offenses strongly suggest that an innocent explanation is implausible.” Hartman, 161 Ohio St.3d 214 at ¶ 58 (to determine whether other acts evidence is genuinely probative of the intent of the accused to commit the charged crime, rather than merely the accused’s propensity to commit similar crimes). This probative value must be outweighed by not just prejudice but by “unfair prejudice,” and this outweighing must be substantial. Evid.R. 403(A). “All state's evidence is meant to be prejudicial.” State v. Rupp, 7th Dist. Mahoning No. 05 MA 166, 2007-Ohio-1561, ¶ 67, citing State v. Crotts, 104 Ohio St.3d 432, 2004-Ohio-6550, 820 N.E.2d 302. Unfair prejudice is not evidenced by the harm caused to the defense by admissible evidence which had a high probative value but involves an invitation to rule based on invalid grounds. State v. Lang, 129 Ohio St.3d 512, 2011-Ohio-4215, 954 N.E.2d 596, ¶ 89. “Because fairness is subjective, the determination of whether evidence is unfairly prejudicial is left to the sound discretion of the trial court and will be overturned only if the discretion is abused.” State v. Crotts, 104 Ohio St.3d 432, 2004-Ohio-6550, 820 N.E.2d 302, ¶ 25. The decision was within the trial court’s discretion. State v. Graham, __ Ohio St. 3d __, 2020-Ohio-6700, __ N.E.3d __, ¶ 72. Notably, the jury heard strong evidence of Appellant’s violence toward the victim on the night her demise began: the video showed Appellant striking the victim’s head with his fist at least twice and causing her head to hit the truck, and later, the victim’s child heard the victim begging Appellant to stop while banging emanated from their location in the basement and then witnessed him punch the victim in the face. Furthermore, as the trial court concluded, prejudice was lessened by the jury instruction. Williams, 134 Ohio St.3d 521 at ¶ 24 (This evidence is not unduly prejudicial, because the trial court instructed the jury that this evidence could not be considered to show [the defendant] had acted in conformity with a character trait. This instruction lessened the prejudicial effect). At the end of trial, the court instructed the jury: “Evidence was received about the commission of other acts other than the offenses with which the defendant is charged in this trial. That evidence was received only for the limited purpose. It was not received and you may not consider it to prove the character of the defendant in order to show that he acted in accordance with that character. If you find that the evidence of other acts is true and that the defendant committed them, you may consider that evidence only for the purpose of deciding whether it proves the absence of mistake.” (Tr. 615-616). We presume the jury followed the limiting instruction stating the other acts evidence was not offered to prove the defendant’s character. Williams, 134 Ohio St.3d 521 at ¶ 23. Appellant argues this instruction should have been tailored to a particular count. He states if the other acts evidence was admissible, then the jury should have been instructed they could only use it for the murder count. He claims he never said the assault at the bar was a mistake or an accident. However, when discussing the blood in his truck, he indicated to the detective he may have accidentally hit the victim with an elbow. He also commented he had her in a “bearhug” outside of the bar merely to get her back in the truck, which impliedly suggested he may have accidentally hurt her in the process, such as when he caused her head to hit the truck’s door frame. Evidence that he bodily threw her in the past would be material to whether this incident was an accident. Furthermore, his repeated slip and fall claims could allow the prosecution to conclude he was suggesting the victim’s main injuries were caused by her alleged fall. In any event, at the motion in limine hearing, the court asked defense counsel to draft the limiting instruction. (Tr. 198). And, there was no objection to the limiting instruction when the court gave the final jury instructions. “On appeal, a party may not assign as error the giving or the failure to give any instructions unless the party objects before the jury retires to consider its verdict, stating specifically the matter objected to and the grounds of the objection.” Crim.R. 30(A). Finally, an “improper evidentiary admission under Evid.R. 404(B) may be deemed harmless error on review when, after the tainted evidence is removed, the remaining evidence is overwhelming.” State v. Tench, 156 Ohio St.3d 85, 2018-Ohio-5205, 123 N.E.3d 955 ¶ 177 (finding harmless error in capital case, where the state presented other acts evidence including evidence the defendant was a suspect in a prior robbery), quoting State v. Morris, 141 Ohio St.3d 399, 2014-Ohio-5052, 24 N.E.3d 1153, ¶ 32. Without any consideration of other acts evidence, the evidence of the offenses was overwhelming, including the independent incidents of felonious assault and the two types of murder. As to the element of purpose for the count one murder, the evidence is further discussed in the next assignment of error. In any event, the state properly introduced other acts against the same victim to show the death was caused with specific intent and not due to mistake or accident. This assignment of error is overruled.\"\n}\n```"}

Defense counsel asked the court to note a continuing objection to the evidence, and the court said it would. The decision was a preliminary ruling before the actual presentation of the evidence during the trial testimony where it could be adjudged in context upon proper objection. The preliminary issue presented in a motion in limine must be renewed at trial when the evidence is actually presented or the argument made therein is waived for purposes of appeal. State v. Hill, 75 Ohio St.3d 195, 202-203, 661 N.E.2d 1068 (1996). On appeal, Appellant claims the court improperly allowed the state to present other acts evidence to demonstrate his propensity for assaulting his wife and to show he acted in conformity with his character. He says the state used the evidence to paint a picture that it was only a matter of time before he killed his wife. He contests the following testimony on other acts. Appellant’s sister-in-law was asked about the relationship between Appellant and the victim. She said it was sometimes loving but they would argue and fight, answering in the affirmative when asked if the relationship ever got physical. There was no objection entered. If a timely objection was lacking, then the appellant must not only show an error occurred and the error was obvious, but he must also show it affected the outcome of the trial. State v. Graham, __ Ohio St.3d __, 2020-Ohio-6700 at ¶ 93 (finding error in admitting other acts evidence but refusing to find plain error as the error did not affect the outcome of trial), citing State v. Barnes, 94 Ohio St.3d 21, 27, 759 N.E.2d 1240 (2002). The general, non-specific testimony of Appellant’s sister-in-law would not have affected Appellant’s substantial rights under the circumstances of this case. The real focus is on the other acts testimony of the victim’s sister, the victim’s child, and on statements Appellant made to the detective. The victim’s sister testified she first realized Appellant was abusive when she looked out her door and saw the victim “fly across the street, like her body.” She did not see the actual physical motion by which Appellant caused this to occur, but she yelled at him not to put his hands on her sister and he apologized. Another time, she intervened when Appellant was “dragging [the victim] up and down the street.” In the past, she observed the victim with injuries such as a broken nose, teeth, and fingers. Over objection, the victim’s sister testified: the victim told her Appellant caused these injuries; the victim told the hospital staff she was injured in a fall; and the staff said the victim’s body could not take much more. The victim’s child testified: she asked Appellant if he would stop hitting her mother months before the victim’s death; he said he would; and the situation got worse. She stated she witnessed Appellant’s prior acts of punching, hitting, throwing, and kicking the victim; she associated the behavior as occurring after Appellant drank liquor. The child said he would threaten the victim by stating: “I’m gonna hurt you if you don’t stop talking.” The child mentioned calling her step-brother on the night at issue because “his mom went through it, so obviously I think he would know what to do” (not necessarily referring to Appellant). There were no objections during these portions of the child’s testimony. The detective testified he asked Appellant about past violence in the relationship. Over objection, the detective said Appellant “initially downplayed it, but ultimately admitted to having some physical altercations” with the victim in the past. Appellant said one such altercation resulted in “a cut over her eye” which occurred when he “grabbed her and she slipped and fell and hit her eye”; Appellant also acknowledged the victim “has lied for him in the past when they have gone to the hospital.” “Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.” Evid.R. 404(B). “Thus, while evidence showing the defendant’s character or propensity to commit crimes or acts is forbidden, evidence of other acts is admissible when the evidence is probative of a separate, nonpropensity-based issue. State v. Hartman, 161 Ohio St.3d 214, 2020-Ohio-4440, 161 N.E.3d 651, ¶ 22. In general, evidence is relevant if it tends “to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination * * * more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.” Evid.R. 401. *See also Hartman*, 161 Ohio St.3d 214 at ¶ 24; Evid.R. 402 (“Evidence which is not relevant is not admissible.”). The relevancy determination in this context asks “whether the evidence is relevant to the particular purpose for which it is offered” which must be one other than character or propensity. *Hartman*, 161 Ohio St.3d 214 at ¶ 26. Evid.R. 404(B) contains a “nonexhaustive list of the permissible nonpropensity purposes for which other-acts evidence may be introduced.” *Id.* at ¶ 26. “The nonpropensity purpose for which the evidence is offered must go to a'material' issue that is actually in dispute between the parties.” *Id.* at ¶ 27. Also, evidence of similar acts “is relevant only if the jury can reasonably conclude that the act occurred and that the defendant was the actor.” *Id.* at ¶ 28. If the evidence is not presented for character and has a permissible purpose under Evid.R. 404(B), then the trial court uses its discretion to determine whether the probative value “is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, of confusion of the issues, or of misleading the jury.” *Id.* at ¶ 29-30, citing Evid.R. 403(A). The probative value and the unfairness of any prejudice can depend on the degree to which the fact is truly in dispute and whether it can be shown with alternative evidence. *Id.* at ¶ 31-32. First, we address Appellant’s claim there was no “substantial proof” he committed the other acts. *Hartman*, 161 Ohio St.3d 214 at ¶ 28. He notes the testimony was not corroborated with a police report or hospital record. “It is not essential to the admissibility of evidence regarding prior incidents that such incidents were either reported to police officials by the victim or resulted in a conviction.” *State v. Jones*, 7th Dist. Mahoning No. 95 C.A. 98 (June 26, 1998) (admitting testimony on an incident where the defendant held his former wife hostage with a rifle ten years prior to the prosecution for the death of his current wife where the defendant claimed the shooting was accidental while they were fighting over a gun), citing *State v. Armstrong*, 74 Ohio App.3d 732, 600 N.E.2d 690 (2d Dist.1991). Here, the “jury can reasonably conclude that the act occurred and that the defendant was the actor.” *See Hartman*, 161 Ohio St.3d 214 at ¶ 28. The jury could evaluate the credibility of the victim’s sister and the victim’s child who claimed to have witnessed certain acts. Moreover, the detective testified as to Appellant’s own admissions about: prior physical arguments, the victim lying for him at the hospital in the past, and a specific incident where the victim ended up with a head wound and Appellant claimed she slipped and fell during a fight. Second, we address Appellant’s argument that other acts evidence cannot be admitted for a use permitted by Evid.R. 404(B) unless the defendant specifically introduced evidence at trial on a defense related to a permissible use of other acts evidence. Appellant points out the non-propensity purpose for admitting the other acts evidence must relate to a material issue “actually in dispute.” *See Hartman*, 161 Ohio St.3d 214 at ¶ 27. He complains the prosecution introduced the defendant’s statement (that the victim was injured due to an accidental fall) and used this to assert a permissible use under Evid.R. 404(B) without waiting to see if he would be opening the door to the issue. As the trial court ruled at the motion in limine hearing, the permissible uses of other acts evidence in Evid.R. 404(B) do not only apply when a defendant takes the stand or presents witnesses. See generally State v. Hunter, 131 Ohio St.3d 67, 2011-Ohio-6524, 960 N.E.2d 955, ¶ 20, 22, 30 (where the defendant told the police the child fell down the stairs and presented no guilt phase witnesses, the Court upheld the decision to admit evidence on prior incidents of injury to the child which the defendant had reported were a result of his falling while holding the child). We note a defendant often does not present witnesses because the state’s witnesses have the information relevant to defending the case, defendants rarely testify, and there is no formal notice a defendant must file disclosing every defense theory to the state. Also, the mere decision to forgo a lengthy opening statement does not bar the state from establishing there is an issue surrounding a permissible use of other acts evidence. The defendant’s own pretrial statements can be used by the state to show the lack of mistake or accident is a material issue in the case. See id. Here, Appellant repeatedly claimed the victim was injured at home as a result of an accident where she fell in a bedroom while running (from him after a night of physical violence as captured on video and subsequently witnessed by the victim’s twelve-year-old child). The state’s first two witnesses (Appellant’s brother and sister-in-law) testified to Appellant’s claim at the scene while the victim was lying on the floor dying. After summoning them and instead of calling 911, Appellant told them the victim was injured when she slipped and fell while running into a bedroom (to pack and leave the house). Appellant also told this story to the police when he was interviewed on the day the victim was hospitalized, and the detective testified to Appellant’s claim. Appellant also suggested to the detective he may have elbowed the victim in the face by mistake while putting her in “a bearhug.” And, Appellant told the victim’s sister he did not put his hands on the victim. Moreover, defense counsel asked the victim’s child whether her mother got aggressive when she drank alcohol, eliciting a statement that the victim would sometimes hit Appellant (but only if he hit her first). Defense counsel cross-examined the neurosurgeon on whether the brain trauma could have resulted from a fall, whether a seizure could cause damage to the brain, and whether the bouncing of a head on the floor during a seizure could cause problems. (Tr. 432). He also asked the forensic pathologist whether the trauma to the victim’s brain could have occurred from just one impact. (Tr. 472). In closing arguments, defense counsel mentioned the testimony stating the victim appeared to be having a seizure. He also said the testimony showed the victim’s injuries could have been sustained “by one fall” while noting she did not appear seriously injured after the punches that were witnessed. (Tr. 580-581). Counsel also urged there was no evidence showing Appellant had intent to purposely cause the death of his wife. (Tr. 581). Appellant next suggests the evidence was not material to the absence of mistake or accident exception. The state urges the absence of mistake or accident as to the cause of the victim’s death and his purpose (intent) were material issues actually in dispute. The state points out to negate a defendant's claim of mistake or accident, the prosecution can use similar incidents to show the act in dispute was not inadvertent, accidental, involuntary, or lacking in guilty knowledge. Hartman, 161 Ohio St.3d 214 at ¶ 52. It is argued the case at bar implicates both categories discussed by Hartman in explaining the two main ways a defendant raises a claim of accident: (1) a statement disputing whether a criminal act occurred at all or (2) a statement disputing the act was committed with criminal intent. Id. at ¶ 52-53. These examples do not require the past incidents to be close in time to the current incident. This court has applied Ohio Supreme Court precedent allowing evidence of prior acts of domestic violence to show motive, intent, and absence of mistake or accident when the defendant later kills the victim.

No. 95 C.A. 98 (admissible other acts testimony on an incident with former wife ten years before the defendant’s current wife was allegedly accidentally shot) In a death penalty case, the defendant said his child fell down the basement steps. The Supreme Court upheld the admission of testimony about two prior hospital visits where the defendant claimed the child was injured when the defendant fell while holding the child. State v. Hunter, 131 Ohio St.3d 67, 2011-Ohio-6524, 960 N.E.2d 955, ¶ 16-17, 109-111. “Such evidence was particularly relevant because it showed that [the defendant’s] claim that [the child] died during an accidental fall was probably untrue. Based on this evidence, the panel could reasonably infer that [the defendant] acted purposefully in killing [the child].” Id. at ¶ 114. Here, the similar incidents involved the same victim. Appellant claimed no criminal act caused the victim’s death as she died after slipping and falling. See Hartman, 161 Ohio St.3d 214 at ¶ 52.

On appeal, Appellant claims the court improperly allowed the state to present other acts evidence to demonstrate his propensity for assaulting his wife and to show he acted in conformity with his character. He says the state used the evidence to paint a picture that it was only a matter of time before he killed his wife. He contests the following testimony on other acts. Appellant’s sister-in-law was asked about the relationship between Appellant and the victim. She said it was sometimes loving but they would argue and fight, answering in the affirmative when asked if the relationship ever got physical. There was no objection entered. If a timely objection was lacking, then the appellant must not only show an error occurred and the error was obvious, but he must also show it affected the outcome of the trial. State v. Graham, __ Ohio St.3d __, 2020-Ohio-6700 at ¶ 93 (finding error in admitting other acts evidence but refusing to find plain error as the error did not affect the outcome of trial), citing State v. Barnes, 94 Ohio St.3d 21, 27, 759 N.E.2d 1240 (2002). The general, non-specific testimony of Appellant’s sister-in-law would not have affected Appellant’s substantial rights under the circumstances of this case. The real focus is on the other acts testimony of the victim’s sister, the victim’s child, and on statements Appellant made to the detective. The victim’s sister testified she first realized Appellant was abusive when she looked out her door and saw the victim “fly across the street, like her body.” She did not see the actual physical motion by which Appellant caused this to occur, but she yelled at him not to put his hands on her sister and he apologized. Another time, she intervened when Appellant was “dragging [the victim] up and down the street.” In the past, she observed the victim with injuries such as a broken nose, teeth, and fingers. Over objection, the victim’s sister testified: the victim told her Appellant caused these injuries; the victim told the hospital staff she was injured in a fall; and the staff said the victim’s body could not take much more. The victim’s child testified: she asked Appellant if he would stop hitting her mother months before the victim’s death; he said he would; and the situation got worse. She stated she witnessed Appellant’s prior acts of punching, hitting, throwing, and kicking the victim; she associated the behavior as occurring after Appellant drank liquor. The child said he would threaten the victim by stating: “I’m gonna hurt you if you don’t stop talking.” The child mentioned calling her step-brother on the night at issue because “his mom went through it, so obviously I think he would know what to do” (not necessarily referring to Appellant). There were no objections during these portions of the child’s testimony. The detective testified he asked Appellant about past violence in the relationship. Over objection, the detective said Appellant “initially downplayed it, but ultimately admitted to having some physical altercations” with the victim in the past. Appellant said one such altercation resulted in “a cut over her eye” which occurred when he “grabbed her and she slipped and fell and hit her eye”; Appellant also acknowledged the victim “has lied for him in the past when they have gone to the hospital.” “Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.” Evid.R. 404(B). “Thus, while evidence showing the defendant’s character or propensity to commit crimes or acts is forbidden, evidence of other acts is admissible when the evidence is probative of a separate, nonpropensity-based issue. State v. Hartman, 161 Ohio St.3d 214, 2020-Ohio-4440, 161 N.E.3d 651, ¶ 22. In general, evidence is relevant if it tends “to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination * * * more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.” Evid.R. 401. *See also Hartman*, 161 Ohio St.3d 214 at ¶ 24; Evid.R. 402 (“Evidence which is not relevant is not admissible.”). The relevancy determination in this context asks “whether the evidence is relevant to the particular purpose for which it is offered” which must be one other than character or propensity. *Hartman*, 161 Ohio St.3d 214 at ¶ 26. Evid.R. 404(B) contains a “nonexhaustive list of the permissible nonpropensity purposes for which other-acts evidence may be introduced.” *Id.* at ¶ 26. “The nonpropensity purpose for which the evidence is offered must go to a'material' issue that is actually in dispute between the parties.” *Id.* at ¶ 27. Also, evidence of similar acts “is relevant only if the jury can reasonably conclude that the act occurred and that the defendant was the actor.” *Id.* at ¶ 28. If the evidence is not presented for character and has a permissible purpose under Evid.R. 404(B), then the trial court uses its discretion to determine whether the probative value “is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, of confusion of the issues, or of misleading the jury.” *Id.* at ¶ 29-30, citing Evid.R. 403(A). The probative value and the unfairness of any prejudice can depend on the degree to which the fact is truly in dispute and whether it can be shown with alternative evidence. *Id.* at ¶ 31-32. First, we address Appellant’s claim there was no “substantial proof” he committed the other acts. *Hartman*, 161 Ohio St.3d 214 at ¶ 28. He notes the testimony was not corroborated with a police report or hospital record. “It is not essential to the admissibility of evidence regarding prior incidents that such incidents were either reported to police officials by the victim or resulted in a conviction.” *State v. Jones*, 7th Dist. Mahoning No. 95 C.A. 98 (June 26, 1998) (admitting testimony on an incident where the defendant held his former wife hostage with a rifle ten years prior to the prosecution for the death of his current wife where the defendant claimed the shooting was accidental while they were fighting over a gun), citing *State v. Armstrong*, 74 Ohio App.3d 732, 600 N.E.2d 690 (2d Dist.1991). Here, the “jury can reasonably conclude that the act occurred and that the defendant was the actor.” *See Hartman*, 161 Ohio St.3d 214 at ¶ 28. The jury could evaluate the credibility of the victim’s sister and the victim’s child who claimed to have witnessed certain acts. Moreover, the detective testified as to Appellant’s own admissions about: prior physical arguments, the victim lying for him at the hospital in the past, and a specific incident where the victim ended up with a head wound and Appellant claimed she slipped and fell during a fight. Second, we address Appellant’s argument that other acts evidence cannot be admitted for a use permitted by Evid.R. 404(B) unless the defendant specifically introduced evidence at trial on a defense related to a permissible use of other acts evidence. Appellant points out the non-propensity purpose for admitting the other acts evidence must relate to a material issue “actually in dispute.” *See Hartman*, 161 Ohio St.3d 214 at ¶ 27. He complains the prosecution introduced the defendant’s statement (that the victim was injured due to an accidental fall) and used this to assert a permissible use under Evid.R. 404(B) without waiting to see if he would be opening the door to the issue. As the trial court ruled at the motion in limine hearing, the permissible uses of other acts evidence in Evid.R. 404(B) do not only apply when a defendant takes the stand or presents witnesses. See generally State v. Hunter, 131 Ohio St.3d 67, 2011-Ohio-6524, 960 N.E.2d 955, ¶ 20, 22, 30 (where the defendant told the police the child fell down the stairs and presented no guilt phase witnesses, the Court upheld the decision to admit evidence on prior incidents of injury to the child which the defendant had reported were a result of his falling while holding the child). We note a defendant often does not present witnesses because the state’s witnesses have the information relevant to defending the case, defendants rarely testify, and there is no formal notice a defendant must file disclosing every defense theory to the state. Also, the mere decision to forgo a lengthy opening statement does not bar the state from establishing there is an issue surrounding a permissible use of other acts evidence. The defendant’s own pretrial statements can be used by the state to show the lack of mistake or accident is a material issue in the case. See id. Here, Appellant repeatedly claimed the victim was injured at home as a result of an accident where she fell in a bedroom while running (from him after a night of physical violence as captured on video and subsequently witnessed by the victim’s twelve-year-old child). The state’s first two witnesses (Appellant’s brother and sister-in-law) testified to Appellant’s claim at the scene while the victim was lying on the floor dying. After summoning them and instead of calling 911, Appellant told them the victim was injured when she slipped and fell while running into a bedroom (to pack and leave the house). Appellant also told this story to the police when he was interviewed on the day the victim was hospitalized, and the detective testified to Appellant’s claim. Appellant also suggested to the detective he may have elbowed the victim in the face by mistake while putting her in “a bearhug.” And, Appellant told the victim’s sister he did not put his hands on the victim. Moreover, defense counsel asked the victim’s child whether her mother got aggressive when she drank alcohol, eliciting a statement that the victim would sometimes hit Appellant (but only if he hit her first). Defense counsel cross-examined the neurosurgeon on whether the brain trauma could have resulted from a fall, whether a seizure could cause damage to the brain, and whether the bouncing of a head on the floor during a seizure could cause problems. (Tr. 432). He also asked the forensic pathologist whether the trauma to the victim’s brain could have occurred from just one impact. (Tr. 472). In closing arguments, defense counsel mentioned the testimony stating the victim appeared to be having a seizure. He also said the testimony showed the victim’s injuries could have been sustained “by one fall” while noting she did not appear seriously injured after the punches that were witnessed. (Tr. 580-581). Counsel also urged there was no evidence showing Appellant had intent to purposely cause the death of his wife. (Tr. 581). Appellant next suggests the evidence was not material to the absence of mistake or accident exception. The state urges the absence of mistake or accident as to the cause of the victim’s death and his purpose (intent) were material issues actually in dispute. The state points out to negate a defendant's claim of mistake or accident, the prosecution can use similar incidents to show the act in dispute was not inadvertent, accidental, involuntary, or lacking in guilty knowledge. Hartman, 161 Ohio St.3d 214 at ¶ 52. It is argued the case at bar implicates both categories discussed by Hartman in explaining the two main ways a defendant raises a claim of accident: (1) a statement disputing whether a criminal act occurred at all or (2) a statement disputing the act was committed with criminal intent. Id. at ¶ 52-53. These examples do not require the past incidents to be close in time to the current incident. This court has applied Ohio Supreme Court precedent allowing evidence of prior acts of domestic violence to show motive, intent, and absence of mistake or accident when the defendant later kills the victim. State v. Ash, 2018-Ohio-1139, 108 N.E.3d 1115, ¶ 67 (7th Dist.) (even an incident temporally removed from the incident in question can be admitted under an exception to show the tumultuous and strained relationship), citing State v. Nields, 93 Ohio St.3d 6, 10, 22, 752 N.E.2d 859 (2001). See also Jones, 7th Dist. No. 95 C.A. 98 (admissible other acts testimony on an incident with former wife ten years before the defendant’s current wife was allegedly accidentally shot) In a death penalty case, the defendant said his child fell down the basement steps. The Supreme Court upheld the admission of testimony about two prior hospital visits where the defendant claimed the child was injured when the defendant fell while holding the child. State v. Hunter, 131 Ohio St.3d 67, 2011-Ohio-6524, 960 N.E.2d 955, ¶ 16-17, 109-111. “Such evidence was particularly relevant because it showed that [the defendant’s] claim that [the child] died during an accidental fall was probably untrue. Based on this evidence, the panel could reasonably infer that [the defendant] acted purposefully in killing [the child].” Id. at ¶ 114. Here, the similar incidents involved the same victim. Appellant claimed no criminal act caused the victim’s death as she died after slipping and falling. See Hartman, 161 Ohio St.3d 214 at ¶ 52. He also claimed some prior physical injuries that night were mistakenly or accidentally inflicted and certain blows to the victim’s head did not cause her death or were not struck with purpose to cause her death. See id. at ¶ 53. Furthermore, when apologizing to the victim’s child soon after the death, he generally claimed he “didn’t mean to do it.” Notably, Hunter involved the defendant’s claim the victim died after suffering an accident by falling; the defendant’s story as to how the child died did not involve a claim he accidentally injured the child. Similarly, the first qualifying example in Hartman involved a defendant’s claim that something caused the victim’s death naturally rather than a claim he accidentally caused it. This concept is on point as to Appellant’s story of the victim’s death (the victim fell when she was running away from him to pack clothes and leave him), and this story was similar to the story Appellant told the detective about the victim’s past head injury (she received a cut above her eye during their fight when he grabbed her and she fell). It also supports the testimony of the victim’s sister confirming Appellant’s statement to the detective that the victim previously lied to cover for him by saying she fell. The contested testimony was not presented as character or propensity evidence but was relevant to an exception to the other acts exclusion which was in material dispute. Next, Appellant contends “the probative value [of the other acts evidence] is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, of confusion of the issues, or of misleading the jury” and was required to be excluded under Evid.R. 403(A). There was no indication the evidence would cause confusion or mislead the jury. The state points out the evidence was highly probative to show the victim’s various injuries were not caused by a mistake or accident and the death was caused with specific intent. It was reasonable to find “under the circumstances, the detailed facts of the charged and uncharged offenses strongly suggest that an innocent explanation is implausible.” Hartman, 161 Ohio St.3d 214 at ¶ 58 (to determine whether other acts evidence is genuinely probative of the intent of the accused to commit the charged crime, rather than merely the accused’s propensity to commit similar crimes). This probative value must be outweighed by not just prejudice but by “unfair prejudice,” and this outweighing must be substantial. Evid.R. 403(A). “All state's evidence is meant to be prejudicial.” State v. Rupp, 7th Dist. Mahoning No. 05 MA 166, 2007-Ohio-1561, ¶ 67, citing State v. Crotts, 104 Ohio St.3d 432, 2004-Ohio-6550, 820 N.E.2d 302. Unfair prejudice is not evidenced by the harm caused to the defense by admissible evidence which had a high probative value but involves an invitation to rule based on invalid grounds. State v. Lang, 129 Ohio St.3d 512, 2011-Ohio-4215, 954 N.E.2d 596, ¶ 89. “Because fairness is subjective, the determination of whether evidence is unfairly prejudicial is left to the sound discretion of the trial court and will be overturned only if the discretion is abused.” State v. Crotts, 104 Ohio St.3d 432, 2004-Ohio-6550, 820 N.E.2d 302, ¶ 25. The decision was within the trial court’s discretion. State v. Graham, __ Ohio St. 3d __, 2020-Ohio-6700, __ N.E.3d __, ¶ 72. Notably, the jury heard strong evidence of Appellant’s violence toward the victim on the night her demise began: the video showed Appellant striking the victim’s head with his fist at least twice and causing her head to hit the truck, and later, the victim’s child heard the victim begging Appellant to stop while banging emanated from their location in the basement and then witnessed him punch the victim in the face. Furthermore, as the trial court concluded, prejudice was lessened by the jury instruction. Williams, 134 Ohio St.3d 521 at ¶ 24 (This evidence is not unduly prejudicial, because the trial court instructed the jury that this evidence could not be considered to show [the defendant] had acted in conformity with a character trait. This instruction lessened the prejudicial effect). At the end of trial, the court instructed the jury: “Evidence was received about the commission of other acts other than the offenses with which the defendant is charged in this trial. That evidence was received only for the limited purpose. It was not received and you may not consider it to prove the character of the defendant in order to show that he acted in accordance with that character. If you find that the evidence of other acts is true and that the defendant committed them, you may consider that evidence only for the purpose of deciding whether it proves the absence of mistake.” (Tr. 615-616). We presume the jury followed the limiting instruction stating the other acts evidence was not offered to prove the defendant’s character. Williams, 134 Ohio St.3d 521 at ¶ 23. Appellant argues this instruction should have been tailored to a particular count. He states if the other acts evidence was admissible, then the jury should have been instructed they could only use it for the murder count. He claims he never said the assault at the bar was a mistake or an accident. However, when discussing the blood in his truck, he indicated to the detective he may have accidentally hit the victim with an elbow. He also commented he had her in a “bearhug” outside of the bar merely to get her back in the truck, which impliedly suggested he may have accidentally hurt her in the process, such as when he caused her head to hit the truck’s door frame. Evidence that he bodily threw her in the past would be material to whether this incident was an accident. Furthermore, his repeated slip and fall claims could allow the prosecution to conclude he was suggesting the victim’s main injuries were caused by her alleged fall. In any event, at the motion in limine hearing, the court asked defense counsel to draft the limiting instruction. (Tr. 198). And, there was no objection to the limiting instruction when the court gave the final jury instructions. “On appeal, a party may not assign as error the giving or the failure to give any instructions unless the party objects before the jury retires to consider its verdict, stating specifically the matter objected to and the grounds of the objection.” Crim.R. 30(A). Finally, an “improper evidentiary admission under Evid.R. 404(B) may be deemed harmless error on review when, after the tainted evidence is removed, the remaining evidence is overwhelming.” State v. Tench, 156 Ohio St.3d 85, 2018-Ohio-5205, 123 N.E.3d 955 ¶ 177 (finding harmless error in capital case, where the state presented other acts evidence including evidence the defendant was a suspect in a prior robbery), quoting State v. Morris, 141 Ohio St.3d 399, 2014-Ohio-5052, 24 N.E.3d 1153, ¶ 32. Without any consideration of other acts evidence, the evidence of the offenses was overwhelming, including the independent incidents of felonious assault and the two types of murder. As to the element of purpose for the count one murder, the evidence is further discussed in the next assignment of error. In any event, the state properly introduced other acts against the same victim to show the death was caused with specific intent and not due to mistake or accident. This assignment of error is overruled.\"\n}\n```"}

The decision was a preliminary ruling before the actual presentation of the evidence during the trial testimony where it could be adjudged in context upon proper objection. The preliminary issue presented in a motion in limine must be renewed at trial when the evidence is actually presented or the argument made therein is waived for purposes of appeal. State v. Hill, 75 Ohio St.3d 195, 202-203, 661 N.E.2d 1068 (1996).

The child said he would threaten the victim by stating: “I’m gonna hurt you if you don’t stop talking.” The child mentioned calling her step-brother on the night at issue because “his mom went through it, so obviously I think he would know what to do” (not necessarily referring to Appellant). There were no objections during these portions of the child’s testimony. The detective testified he asked Appellant about past violence in the relationship.

He notes the testimony was not corroborated with a police report or hospital record. “It is not essential to the admissibility of evidence regarding prior incidents that such incidents were either reported to police officials by the victim or resulted in a conviction.” *State v.

Moreover, the detective testified as to Appellant’s own admissions about: prior physical arguments, the victim lying for him at the hospital in the past, and a specific incident where the victim ended up with a head wound and Appellant claimed she slipped and fell during a fight. Second, we address Appellant’s argument that other acts evidence cannot be admitted for a use permitted by Evid.R. 404(B) unless the defendant specifically introduced evidence at trial on a defense related to a permissible use of other acts evidence. Appellant points out the non-propensity purpose for admitting the other acts evidence must relate to a material issue “actually in dispute.” *See Hartman*, 161 Ohio St.3d 214 at ¶ 27.

As the trial court ruled at the motion in limine hearing, the permissible uses of other acts evidence in Evid.R. 404(B) do not only apply when a defendant takes the stand or presents witnesses. See generally State v. Hunter, 131 Ohio St.3d 67, 2011-Ohio-6524, 960 N.E.2d 955, ¶ 20, 22, 30 (where the defendant told the police the child fell down the stairs and presented no guilt phase witnesses, the Court upheld the decision to admit evidence on prior incidents of injury to the child which the defendant had reported were a result of his falling while holding the child). We note a defendant often does not present witnesses because the state’s witnesses have the information relevant to defending the case, defendants rarely testify, and there is no formal notice a defendant must file disclosing every defense theory to the state. Also, the mere decision to forgo a lengthy opening statement does not bar the state from establishing there is an issue surrounding a permissible use of other acts evidence. The defendant’s own pretrial statements can be used by the state to show the lack of mistake or accident is a material issue in the case. See id.

He also said the testimony showed the victim’s injuries could have been sustained “by one fall” while noting she did not appear seriously injured after the punches that were witnessed. (Tr. 580-581). Counsel also urged there was no evidence showing Appellant had intent to purposely cause the death of his wife. (Tr. 581). Appellant next suggests the evidence was not material to the absence of mistake or accident exception. The state urges the absence of mistake or accident as to the cause of the victim’s death and his purpose (intent) were material issues actually in dispute. The state points out to negate a defendant's claim of mistake or accident, the prosecution can use similar incidents to show the act in dispute was not inadvertent, accidental, involuntary, or lacking in guilty knowledge. Hartman, 161 Ohio St.3d 214 at ¶ 52. It is argued the case at bar implicates both categories discussed by Hartman in explaining the two main ways a defendant raises a claim of accident: (1) a statement disputing whether a criminal act occurred at all or (2) a statement disputing the act was committed with criminal intent. Id. at ¶ 52-53. These examples do not require the past incidents to be close in time to the current incident. This court has applied Ohio Supreme Court precedent allowing evidence of prior acts of domestic violence to show motive, intent, and absence of mistake or accident when the defendant later kills the victim. State v. Ash, 2018-Ohio-1139, 108 N.E.3d 1115, ¶ 67 (7th Dist.) (even an incident temporally removed from the incident in question can be admitted under an exception to show the tumultuous and strained relationship), citing State v. Nields, 93 Ohio St.3d 6, 10, 22, 752 N.E.2d 859 (2001). See also Jones, 7th Dist. No. 95 C.A. 98 (admissible other acts testimony on an incident with former wife ten years before the defendant’s current wife was allegedly accidentally shot) In a death penalty case, the defendant said his child fell down the basement steps. The Supreme Court upheld the admission of testimony about two prior hospital visits where the defendant claimed the child was injured when the defendant fell while holding the child. State v. Hunter, 131 Ohio St.3d 67, 2011-Ohio-6524, 960 N.E.2d 955, ¶ 16-17, 109-111. “Such evidence was particularly relevant because it showed that [the defendant’s] claim that [the child] died during an accidental fall was probably untrue. Based on this evidence, the panel could reasonably infer that [the defendant] acted purposefully in killing [the child].” Id. at ¶ 114. Here, the similar incidents involved the same victim. Appellant claimed no criminal act caused the victim’s death as she died after slipping and falling. See Hartman, 161 Ohio St.3d 214 at ¶ 52. He also claimed some prior physical injuries that night were mistakenly or accidentally inflicted and certain blows to the victim’s head did not cause her death or were not struck with purpose to cause her death. See id. at ¶ 53. Furthermore, when apologizing to the victim’s child soon after the death, he generally claimed he “didn’t mean to do it.” Notably, Hunter involved the defendant’s claim the victim died after suffering an accident by falling; the defendant’s story as to how the child died did not involve a claim he accidentally injured the child. Similarly, the first qualifying example in Hartman involved a defendant’s claim that something caused the victim’s death naturally rather than a claim he accidentally caused it. This concept is on point as to Appellant’s story of the victim’s death (the victim fell when she was running away from him to pack clothes and leave him), and this story was similar to the story Appellant told the detective about the victim’s past head injury (she received a cut above her eye during their fight when he grabbed her and she fell). It also supports the testimony of the victim’s sister confirming Appellant’s statement to the detective that the victim previously lied to cover for him by saying she fell. The contested testimony was not presented as character or propensity evidence but was relevant to an exception to the other acts exclusion which was in material dispute. Next, Appellant contends “the probative value [of the other acts evidence] is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, of confusion of the issues, or of misleading the jury” and was required to be excluded under Evid.R. 403(A). There was no indication the evidence would cause confusion or mislead the jury. The state points out the evidence was highly probative to show the victim’s various injuries were not caused by a mistake or accident and the death was caused with specific intent. It was reasonable to find “under the circumstances, the detailed facts of the charged and uncharged offenses strongly suggest that an innocent explanation is implausible.” Hartman, 161 Ohio St.3d 214 at ¶ 58 (to determine whether other acts evidence is genuinely probative of the intent of the accused to commit the charged crime, rather than merely the accused’s propensity to commit similar crimes). This probative value must be outweighed by not just prejudice but by “unfair prejudice,” and this outweighing must be substantial. Evid.R. 403(A). “All state's evidence is meant to be prejudicial.” State v. Rupp, 7th Dist. Mahoning No. 05 MA 166, 2007-Ohio-1561, ¶ 67, citing State v. Crotts, 104 Ohio St.3d 432, 2004-Ohio-6550, 820 N.E.2d 302. Unfair prejudice is not evidenced by the harm caused to the defense by admissible evidence which had a high probative value but involves an invitation to rule based on invalid grounds. State v. Lang, 129 Ohio St.3d 512, 2011-Ohio-4215, 954 N.E.2d 596, ¶ 89. “Because fairness is subjective, the determination of whether evidence is unfairly prejudicial is left to the sound discretion of the trial court and will be overturned only if the discretion is abused.” State v. Crotts, 104 Ohio St.3d 432, 2004-Ohio-6550, 820 N.E.2d 302, ¶ 25. The decision was within the trial court’s discretion. State v. Graham, __ Ohio St. 3d __, 2020-Ohio-6700, __ N.E.3d __, ¶ 72. Notably, the jury heard strong evidence of Appellant’s violence toward the victim on the night her demise began: the video showed Appellant striking the victim’s head with his fist at least twice and causing her head to hit the truck, and later, the victim’s child heard the victim begging Appellant to stop while banging emanated from their location in the basement and then witnessed him punch the victim in the face. Furthermore, as the trial court concluded, prejudice was lessened by the jury instruction. Williams, 134 Ohio St.3d 521 at ¶ 24 (This evidence is not unduly prejudicial, because the trial court instructed the jury that this evidence could not be considered to show [the defendant] had acted in conformity with a character trait. This instruction lessened the prejudicial effect). At the end of trial, the court instructed the jury: “Evidence was received about the commission of other acts other than the offenses with which the defendant is charged in this trial. That evidence was received only for the limited purpose. It was not received and you may not consider it to prove the character of the defendant in order to show that he acted in accordance with that character. If you find that the evidence of other acts is true and that the defendant committed them, you may consider that evidence only for the purpose of deciding whether it proves the absence of mistake.” (Tr. 615-616). We presume the jury followed the limiting instruction stating the other acts evidence was not offered to prove the defendant’s character. Williams, 134 Ohio St.3d 521 at ¶ 23. Appellant argues this instruction should have been tailored to a particular count. He states if the other acts evidence was admissible, then the jury should have been instructed they could only use it for the murder count. He claims he never said the assault at the bar was a mistake or an accident. However, when discussing the blood in his truck, he indicated to the detective he may have accidentally hit the victim with an elbow. He also commented he had her in a “bearhug” outside of the bar merely to get her back in the truck, which impliedly suggested he may have accidentally hurt her in the process, such as when he caused her head to hit the truck’s door frame. Evidence that he bodily threw her in the past would be material to whether this incident was an accident. Furthermore, his repeated slip and fall claims could allow the prosecution to conclude he was suggesting the victim’s main injuries were caused by her alleged fall. In any event, at the motion in limine hearing, the court asked defense counsel to draft the limiting instruction. (Tr. 198). And, there was no objection to the limiting instruction when the court gave the final jury instructions. “On appeal, a party may not assign as error the giving or the failure to give any instructions unless the party objects before the jury retires to consider its verdict, stating specifically the matter objected to and the grounds of the objection.” Crim.R. 30(A). Finally, an “improper evidentiary admission under Evid.R. 404(B) may be deemed harmless error on review when, after the tainted evidence is removed, the remaining evidence is overwhelming.” State v. Tench, 156 Ohio St.3d 85, 2018-Ohio-5205, 123 N.E.3d 955 ¶ 177 (finding harmless error in capital case, where the state presented other acts evidence including evidence the defendant was a suspect in a prior robbery), quoting State v. Morris, 141 Ohio St.3d 399, 2014-Ohio-5052, 24 N.E.3d 1153, ¶ 32. Without any consideration of other acts evidence, the evidence of the offenses was overwhelming, including the independent incidents of felonious assault and the two types of murder. As to the element of purpose for the count one murder, the evidence is further discussed in the next assignment of error. In any event, the state properly introduced other acts against the same victim to show the death was caused with specific intent and not due to mistake or accident. This assignment of error is overruled.\"\n}\n```"}

Defense counsel asked the court to note a continuing objection to the evidence, and the court said it would. The decision was a preliminary ruling before the actual presentation of the evidence during the trial testimony where it could be adjudged in context upon proper objection. The preliminary issue presented in a motion in limine must be renewed at trial when the evidence is actually presented or the argument made therein is waived for purposes of appeal. State v. Hill, 75 Ohio St.3d 195, 202-203, 661 N.E.2d 1068 (1996). On appeal, Appellant claims the court improperly allowed the state to present other acts evidence to demonstrate his propensity for assaulting his wife and to show he acted in conformity with his character. He says the state used the evidence to paint a picture that it was only a matter of time before he killed his wife. He contests the following testimony on other acts. Appellant’s sister-in-law was asked about the relationship between Appellant and the victim. She said it was sometimes loving but they would argue and fight, answering in the affirmative when asked if the relationship ever got physical. There was no objection entered. If a timely objection was lacking, then the appellant must not only show an error occurred and the error was obvious, but he must also show it affected the outcome of the trial. State v. Graham, __ Ohio St.3d __, 2020-Ohio-6700 at ¶ 93 (finding error in admitting other acts evidence but refusing to find plain error as the error did not affect the outcome of trial), citing State v. Barnes, 94 Ohio St.3d 21, 27, 759 N.E.2d 1240 (2002). The general, non-specific testimony of Appellant’s sister-in-law would not have affected Appellant’s substantial rights under the circumstances of this case. The real focus is on the other acts testimony of the victim’s sister, the victim’s child, and on statements Appellant made to the detective. The victim’s sister testified she first realized Appellant was abusive when she looked out her door and saw the victim “fly across the street, like her body.” She did not see the actual physical motion by which Appellant caused this to occur, but she yelled at him not to put his hands on her sister and he apologized. Another time, she intervened when Appellant was “dragging [the victim] up and down the street.” In the past, she observed the victim with injuries such as a broken nose, teeth, and fingers. Over objection, the victim’s sister testified: the victim told her Appellant caused these injuries; the victim told the hospital staff she was injured in a fall; and the staff said the victim’s body could not take much more. The victim’s child testified: she asked Appellant if he would stop hitting her mother months before the victim’s death; he said he would; and the situation got worse. She stated she witnessed Appellant’s prior acts of punching, hitting, throwing, and kicking the victim; she associated the behavior as occurring after Appellant drank liquor. The child said he would threaten the victim by stating: “I’m gonna hurt you if you don’t stop talking.” The child mentioned calling her step-brother on the night at issue because “his mom went through it, so obviously I think he would know what to do” (not necessarily referring to Appellant). There were no objections during these portions of the child’s testimony. The detective testified he asked Appellant about past violence in the relationship. Over objection, the detective said Appellant “initially downplayed it, but ultimately admitted to having some physical altercations” with the victim in the past. Appellant said one such altercation resulted in “a cut over her eye” which occurred when he “grabbed her and she slipped and fell and hit her eye”; Appellant also acknowledged the victim “has lied for him in the past when they have gone to the hospital.” “Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.” Evid.R. 404(B). “Thus, while evidence showing the defendant’s character or propensity to commit crimes or acts is forbidden, evidence of other acts is admissible when the evidence is probative of a separate, nonpropensity-based issue. State v. Hartman, 161 Ohio St.3d 214, 2020-Ohio-4440, 161 N.E.3d 651, ¶ 22. In general, evidence is relevant if it tends “to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination * * * more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.” Evid.R. 401. *See also Hartman*, 161 Ohio St.3d 214 at ¶ 24; Evid.R. 402 (“Evidence which is not relevant is not admissible.”). The relevancy determination in this context asks “whether the evidence is relevant to the particular purpose for which it is offered” which must be one other than character or propensity. *Hartman*, 161 Ohio St.3d 214 at ¶ 26. Evid.R. 404(B) contains a “nonexhaustive list of the permissible nonpropensity purposes for which other-acts evidence may be introduced.” *Id.* at ¶ 26. “The nonpropensity purpose for which the evidence is offered must go to a'material' issue that is actually in dispute between the parties.” *Id.* at ¶ 27. Also, evidence of similar acts “is relevant only if the jury can reasonably conclude that the act occurred and that the defendant was the actor.” *Id.* at ¶ 28. If the evidence is not presented for character and has a permissible purpose under Evid.R. 404(B), then the trial court uses its discretion to determine whether the probative value “is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, of confusion of the issues, or of misleading the jury.” *Id.* at ¶ 29-30, citing Evid.R. 403(A). The probative value and the unfairness of any prejudice can depend on the degree to which the fact is truly in dispute and whether it can be shown with alternative evidence. *Id.* at ¶ 31-32. First, we address Appellant’s claim there was no “substantial proof” he committed the other acts. *Hartman*, 161 Ohio St.3d 214 at ¶ 28. He notes the testimony was not corroborated with a police report or hospital record. “It is not essential to the admissibility of evidence regarding prior incidents that such incidents were either reported to police officials by the victim or resulted in a conviction.” *State v. Jones*, 7th Dist. Mahoning No. 95 C.A. 98 (June 26, 1998) (admitting testimony on an incident where the defendant held his former wife hostage with a rifle ten years prior to the prosecution for the death of his current wife where the defendant claimed the shooting was accidental while they were fighting over a gun), citing *State v. Armstrong*, 74 Ohio App.3d 732, 600 N.E.2d 690 (2d Dist.1991). Here, the “jury can reasonably conclude that the act occurred and that the defendant was the actor.” *See Hartman*, 161 Ohio St.3d 214 at ¶ 28. The jury could evaluate the credibility of the victim’s sister and the victim’s child who claimed to have witnessed certain acts. Moreover, the detective testified as to Appellant’s own admissions about: prior physical arguments, the victim lying for him at the hospital in the past, and a specific incident where the victim ended up with a head wound and Appellant claimed she slipped and fell during a fight. Second, we address Appellant’s argument that other acts evidence cannot be admitted for a use permitted by Evid.R. 404(B) unless the defendant specifically introduced evidence at trial on a defense related to a permissible use of other acts evidence. Appellant points out the non-propensity purpose for admitting the other acts evidence must relate to a material issue “actually in dispute.” *See Hartman*, 161 Ohio St.3d 214 at ¶ 27. He complains the prosecution introduced the defendant’s statement (that the victim was injured due to an accidental fall) and used this to assert a permissible use under Evid.R. 404(B) without waiting to see if he would be opening the door to the issue. As the trial court ruled at the motion in limine hearing, the permissible uses of other acts evidence in Evid.R. 404(B) do not only apply when a defendant takes the stand or presents witnesses. See generally State v. Hunter, 131 Ohio St.3d 67, 2011-Ohio-6524, 960 N.E.2d 955, ¶ 20, 22, 30 (where the defendant told the police the child fell down the stairs and presented no guilt phase witnesses, the Court upheld the decision to admit evidence on prior incidents of injury to the child which the defendant had reported were a result of his falling while holding the child). We note a defendant often does not present witnesses because the state’s witnesses have the information relevant to defending the case, defendants rarely testify, and there is no formal notice a defendant must file disclosing every defense theory to the state. Also, the mere decision to forgo a lengthy opening statement does not bar the state from establishing there is an issue surrounding a permissible use of other acts evidence. The defendant’s own pretrial statements can be used by the state to show the lack of mistake or accident is a material issue in the case. See id. Here, Appellant repeatedly claimed the victim was injured at home as a result of an accident where she fell in a bedroom while running (from him after a night of physical violence as captured on video and subsequently witnessed by the victim’s twelve-year-old child). The state’s first two witnesses (Appellant’s brother and sister-in-law) testified to Appellant’s claim at the scene while the victim was lying on the floor dying. After summoning them and instead of calling 911, Appellant told them the victim was injured when she slipped and fell while running into a bedroom (to pack and leave the house). Appellant also told this story to the police when he was interviewed on the day the victim was hospitalized, and the detective testified to Appellant’s claim. Appellant also suggested to the detective he may have elbowed the victim in the face by mistake while putting her in “a bearhug.” And, Appellant told the victim’s sister he did not put his hands on the victim. Moreover, defense counsel asked the victim’s child whether her mother got aggressive when she drank alcohol, eliciting a statement that the victim would sometimes hit Appellant (but only if he hit her first). Defense counsel cross-examined the neurosurgeon on whether the brain trauma could have resulted from a fall, whether a seizure could cause damage to the brain, and whether the bouncing of a head on the floor during a seizure could cause problems. (Tr. 432). He also asked the forensic pathologist whether the trauma to the victim’s brain could have occurred from just one impact. (Tr. 472). In closing arguments, defense counsel mentioned the testimony stating the victim appeared to be having a seizure. He also said the testimony showed the victim’s injuries could have been sustained “by one fall” while noting she did not appear seriously injured after the punches that were witnessed. (Tr. 580-581). Counsel also urged there was no evidence showing Appellant had intent to purposely cause the death of his wife. (Tr. 581). Appellant next suggests the evidence was not material to the absence of mistake or accident exception. The state urges the absence of mistake or accident as to the cause of the victim’s death and his purpose (intent) were material issues actually in dispute. The state points out to negate a defendant's claim of mistake or accident, the prosecution can use similar incidents to show the act in dispute was not inadvertent, accidental, involuntary, or lacking in guilty knowledge. Hartman, 161 Ohio St.3d 214 at ¶ 52. It is argued the case at bar implicates both categories discussed by Hartman in explaining the two main ways a defendant raises a claim of accident: (1) a statement disputing whether a criminal act occurred at all or (2) a statement disputing the act was committed with criminal intent. Id. at ¶ 52-53. These examples do not require the past incidents to be close in time to the current incident. This court has applied Ohio Supreme Court precedent allowing evidence of prior acts of domestic violence to show motive, intent, and absence of mistake or accident when the defendant later kills the victim.

No. 95 C.A. 98 (admissible other acts testimony on an incident with former wife ten years before the defendant’s current wife was allegedly accidentally shot) In a death penalty case, the defendant said his child fell down the basement steps. The Supreme Court upheld the admission of testimony about two prior hospital visits where the defendant claimed the child was injured when the defendant fell while holding the child. State v. Hunter, 131 Ohio St.3d 67, 2011-Ohio-6524, 960 N.E.2d 955, ¶ 16-17, 109-111. “Such evidence was particularly relevant because it showed that [the defendant’s] claim that [the child] died during an accidental fall was probably untrue.

{"Index": "378-Patton", "allegation_num": "allegation_1", "allegation": "Insufficient evidence to support the convictions and the convictions were against the manifest weight of the evidence.", "discussion": "```json\n{\n  \"discussion\": \"In his first and second assignments of error, which he argues together, Patton contends that his convictions were not supported by sufficient evidence and were against the manifest weight of the evidence. 'In a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, the question is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the state, any rational trier of fact could have found all the essential elements of the crime proved beyond a reasonable doubt.' State v. Ham, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-170043, 2017-Ohio-9189, ¶ 19, citing State v. Jenks, 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 273, 574 N.E.2d 492 (1991), paragraph two of the syllabus. Patton was convicted of two counts of murder in violation of R.C. 2903.02(A), which prohibits 'purposely caus[ing] the death of another * * *.' At trial, the state argued that Patton was guilty of purposeful murder under the theory of complicity. R.C. 2923.03(A)(2) defines the offense of complicity, in relevant part, as follows: No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the commission of an offense, shall do any of the following: (2) Aid or abet another in committing the offense. 'To support a conviction for complicity by aiding and abetting, pursuant to R.C. 2923.03(A)(2), the evidence must show that the defendant supported, assisted, encouraged, cooperated with, advised, or incited the principal in the commission of the crime, and that the defendant shared the criminal intent of the principal.' State v. Johnson, 93 Ohio St.3d 240, 754 N.E.2d 796 (2001), syllabus. 'The mere presence of an accused at the scene of a crime is not sufficient to prove, in and of itself, that the accused was an aider and abettor.' Id. at 243, quoting State v. Widner, 69 Ohio St.2d 267, 269, 431 N.E. 1025 (1982). R.C. 2923.03(A) specifies that a person is only guilty of complicity when he acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of an offense. The aider and abettor must share the criminal intent of the principal. Id. at syllabus. Thus, Patton is guilty of complicity to commit murder only if he purposefully aided or abetted in the murders of Anderson and Davis. 'A defendant’s participation in criminal intent may be inferred from the circumstances surrounding the crime.' In re J.C., 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-180493, 2019-Ohio-4027, ¶ 15, appeal not allowed, 157 Ohio St.3d 1565, 2020-Ohio-313, 138 N.E.3d 1167, ¶ 15. Aiding and abetting may be shown by both direct and circumstantial evidence, and participation may be inferred from presence, companionship, and conduct before and after the offense is committed. Johnson at 245. In this case, it is undisputed that Searcy murdered Anderson and Davis. Patton contends that the state presented no evidence that Patton had the same purposeful intent to shoot and kill the victims as Searcy. The state argues that the evidence that Patton started the fight, Wells’s testimony that Patton threatened to shoot while continuously touching his side, and Hicks’s testimony that Patton gave his gun to Searcy immediately before starting the altercation is sufficient evidence to infer his intent from the surrounding circumstances. When this evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to the state, it is clear that any rational juror could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Patton’s conduct of threatening the group while grabbing his side, giving Searcy his gun, then immediately running and punching Anderson could lead a reasonable jury to conclude that Patton acted purposely to aid and abet Searcy in the murders of Anderson and Davis. 'Even though supported by sufficient evidence, a conviction may still be reversed as being against the manifest weight of the evidence.' State v. McCombs, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 15AP-245, 2015-Ohio-3848, ¶ 3, citing State v. Thompkins, 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 387, 678 N.E.2d 541 (1997). 'While sufficiency of the evidence is a test of adequacy regarding whether the evidence is legally sufficient to support the verdict as a matter of law, the criminal manifest-weight-of-the-evidence standard addresses the evidence’s effect of inducing belief.' State v. Cassell, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 08AP-1093, 2010-Ohio-1881, ¶ 38. When considering a challenge to the weight of the evidence, an appellate court must review the entire record, weigh the evidence and all reasonable inferences, consider the credibility of the witnesses, and determine whether, in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the trier of fact clearly lost its way and created a manifest miscarriage of justice. Thompkins at 387. 'When reversing a conviction on the basis that it was against the manifest weight of the evidence, an appellate court sits as a ‘thirteenth juror,’ and disagrees with the factfinder’s resolution of the conflicting testimony.' State v. Tucker, 9th Dist. Medina No. 06CA0035-M, 2006-Ohio-6914, ¶ 5. Reversing a conviction as being against the manifest weight of the evidence should be reserved for only the most '‘exceptional case in which the evidence weighs heavily against the conviction.’' State v. Martin, 20 Ohio App.3d 172, 485 N.E.2d 717 (1st Dist.1983), paragraph three of the syllabus. Patton argues that the testimony of both Wells and Hicks was inconsistent with the statements given to the police on the night of the incident. At trial, both witnesses testified to a more detailed account of the events than they initially gave the police. Patton further argues that no physical evidence connected him to the crimes. Both Wells and Hicks were extensively cross-examined about the additional details. Wells explained that when she spoke with the police, she was in tears and under immense stress. She remembered more details after she spoke with the police. Hicks initially told the police that he saw an exchange between Patton and Searcy that he believed was a gun. At trial, Hicks testified he saw the gun being exchanged, although he could not identify the gun. With respect to the lack of physical evidence, the gun was never recovered and no fingerprints could be obtained from the shell casings. However, the state is not required to present physical evidence or recover a weapon to satisfy its burden. See State v. English, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-180697, 2020-Ohio-4682, ¶ 29. Next, Patton basically contends that the jurors should not have believed the testimony of Wells and Hicks. Generally, issues of witness credibility are for the trier of fact to resolve. See State v. Issa, 93 Ohio St.3d 49, 67, 752 N.E.2d 904 (2001). The trier of fact sees and hears the witnesses and is particularly competent to determine 'whether, and to what extent, to credit the testimony of particular witnesses.' State v. Glover, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C- 180572, 2019-Ohio-5211, ¶ 30. We cannot conclude that the factfinder lost its way and created a manifest miscarriage of justice.\"\n}\n```"}

Patton was convicted of two counts of murder in violation of R.C. 2903.02(A), which prohibits 'purposely caus[ing] the death of another * * *.' At trial, the state argued that Patton was guilty of purposeful murder under the theory of complicity. R.C. 2923.03(A)(2) defines the offense of complicity, in relevant part, as follows: No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the commission of an offense, shall do any of the following: (2) Aid or abet another in committing the offense. 'To support a conviction for complicity by aiding and abetting, pursuant to R.C. 2923.03(A)(2), the evidence must show that the defendant supported, assisted, encouraged, cooperated with, advised, or incited the principal in the commission of the crime, and that the defendant shared the criminal intent of the principal.' State v. Johnson, 93 Ohio St.3d 240, 754 N.E.2d 796 (2001), syllabus. 'The mere presence of an accused at the scene of a crime is not sufficient to prove, in and of itself, that the accused was an aider and abettor.' Id. at 243, quoting State v. Widner, 69 Ohio St.2d 267, 269, 431 N.E. 1025 (1982). R.C. 2923.03(A) specifies that a person is only guilty of complicity when he acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of an offense. The aider and abettor must share the criminal intent of the principal. Id. at syllabus. Thus, Patton is guilty of complicity to commit murder only if he purposefully aided or abetted in the murders of Anderson and Davis. 'A defendant’s participation in criminal intent may be inferred from the circumstances surrounding the crime.' In re J.C., 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-180493, 2019-Ohio-4027, ¶ 15, appeal not allowed, 157 Ohio St.3d 1565, 2020-Ohio-313, 138 N.E.3d 1167, ¶ 15. Aiding and abetting may be shown by both direct and circumstantial evidence, and participation may be inferred from presence, companionship, and conduct before and after the offense is committed. Johnson at 245. In this case, it is undisputed that Searcy murdered Anderson and Davis. Patton contends that the state presented no evidence that Patton had the same purposeful intent to shoot and kill the victims as Searcy. The state argues that the evidence that Patton started the fight, Wells’s testimony that Patton threatened to shoot while continuously touching his side, and Hicks’s testimony that Patton gave his gun to Searcy immediately before starting the altercation is sufficient evidence to infer his intent from the surrounding circumstances. When this evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to the state, it is clear that any rational juror could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Patton’s conduct of threatening the group while grabbing his side, giving Searcy his gun, then immediately running and punching Anderson could lead a reasonable jury to conclude that Patton acted purposely to aid and abet Searcy in the murders of Anderson and Davis. 'Even though supported by sufficient evidence, a conviction may still be reversed as being against the manifest weight of the evidence.' State v. McCombs, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 15AP-245, 2015-Ohio-3848, ¶ 3, citing State v. Thompkins, 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 387, 678 N.E.2d 541 (1997). 'While sufficiency of the evidence is a test of adequacy regarding whether the evidence is legally sufficient to support the verdict as a matter of law, the criminal manifest-weight-of-the-evidence standard addresses the evidence’s effect of inducing belief.' State v. Cassell, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 08AP-1093, 2010-Ohio-1881, ¶ 38. When considering a challenge to the weight of the evidence, an appellate court must review the entire record, weigh the evidence and all reasonable inferences, consider the credibility of the witnesses, and determine whether, in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the trier of fact clearly lost its way and created a manifest miscarriage of justice. Thompkins at 387. 'When reversing a conviction on the basis that it was against the manifest weight of the evidence, an appellate court sits as a ‘thirteenth juror,’ and disagrees with the factfinder’s resolution of the conflicting testimony.' State v. Tucker, 9th Dist. Medina No. 06CA0035-M, 2006-Ohio-6914, ¶ 5. Reversing a conviction as being against the manifest weight of the evidence should be reserved for only the most '‘exceptional case in which the evidence weighs heavily against the conviction.’' State v. Martin, 20 Ohio App.3d 172, 485 N.E.2d 717 (1st Dist.1983), paragraph three of the syllabus. Patton argues that the testimony of both Wells and Hicks was inconsistent with the statements given to the police on the night of the incident. At trial, both witnesses testified to a more detailed account of the events than they initially gave the police. Patton further argues that no physical evidence connected him to the crimes. Both Wells and Hicks were extensively cross-examined about the additional details. Wells explained that when she spoke with the police, she was in tears and under immense stress. She remembered more details after she spoke with the police. Hicks initially told the police that he saw an exchange between Patton and Searcy that he believed was a gun. At trial, Hicks testified he saw the gun being exchanged, although he could not identify the gun. With respect to the lack of physical evidence, the gun was never recovered and no fingerprints could be obtained from the shell casings. However, the state is not required to present physical evidence or recover a weapon to satisfy its burden. See State v. English, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-180697, 2020-Ohio-4682, ¶ 29. Next, Patton basically contends that the jurors should not have believed the testimony of Wells and Hicks. Generally, issues of witness credibility are for the trier of fact to resolve. See State v. Issa, 93 Ohio St.3d 49, 67, 752 N.E.2d 904 (2001). The trier of fact sees and hears the witnesses and is particularly competent to determine 'whether, and to what extent, to credit the testimony of particular witnesses.' State v. Glover, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C- 180572, 2019-Ohio-5211, ¶ 30. We cannot conclude that the factfinder lost its way and created a manifest miscarriage of justice.\"\n}\n```"}

Lawson, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 16288, 1997 WL 476684, *4 (Aug. 22, 1997). This court will not substitute its judgment for that of the trier of fact on the issue of witness credibility unless it is patently apparent that the trier of fact lost its way in arriving at its verdict. State v. Bradley, 2d Dist. Champaign No. 97-CA-03, 1997 WL 691510, *4 (Oct. 24, 1997). R.C. 2925.03(A)(2), the drug trafficking statute, provides, in relevant part: (A) No person shall knowingly do any of the following: * * * (2) Prepare for shipment, ship, transport, deliver, prepare for distribution, or distribute a controlled substance or a controlled substance analog, when the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the controlled substance or a controlled substance analog is intended for sale or resale by the offender or another person. The drug possession statute that Phifer was found guilty of violating provides that ‘[n]o person shall knowingly obtain, possess, or use a controlled substance or a controlled substance analog.’ R.C. 2925.11(A). Methamphetamine is a controlled substance. See R.C. 2925.11(II). For purposes of drug offenses, ‘‘possess’ or ‘possession’ means having control over a thing or substance, but may not be inferred solely from mere access to the thing or substance through ownership or occupation of the premises upon which the thing or substance is found.’ R.C. 2925.01(K). ‘A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is aware that the person's conduct will probably cause a certain result or will probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.’ R.C. 2901.22(B). Here, Phifer argues that the evidence was insufficient to establish that he knowingly sold or offered to sell methamphetamine or that he knowingly possessed methamphetamine. However, Detective Nawman testified that while he and Detective Snyder were conducting surveillance of Phifer’s residence, he observed two individuals arrive in a blue vehicle, whereupon Phifer exited the residence, walked to the vehicle, and spoke to the individuals. Phifer then walked around to the passenger side of the vehicle and placed his hands inside the passenger side window. Detective Nawman testified that he did not see drugs being exchanged, but he did observe one of the individuals give money to Phifer. Based upon his experience as a narcotics detective and law enforcement officer for many years, Detective Nawman believed that he had just witnessed the sale of illegal drugs. Detective Nawman testified that, a short time later, he observed another individual exit a nearby residence, walk over to Phifer’s residence, enter Phifer’s residence, and then exit approximately one or two minutes later. Detective Nawman testified that the incidents he observed while surveilling Phifer’s residence were consistent with the illegal sale of narcotics. APA Starkey and the other APA officers then arrived at Phifer’s residence and went inside without the detectives; Starkey testified that she encountered several individuals, including Phifer and a young child, inside the residence. Starkey testified that she and the other APA officers observed an open black duffel bag on a recliner in the front room that contained a baggie containing a white substance; the substance was later identified as crack cocaine. Starkey also testified that she and the APA officers discovered another baggie containing a white substance and pills underneath a black sofa in the front room; this substance was later identified as over 15 grams of methamphetamine, over five times the bulk limit. Starkey testified that she and the other APA officers also found a ‘burner’ cellphone under the cushions of the sofa, a baggie containing marijuana, and various other drug paraphernalia during their search of the house. After placing all of the contraband and paraphernalia in a pile in the front room of Phifer’s residence, the APA officers contacted the detectives and asked for their assistance. They told the detectives where they had found the various items. As previously stated, the detectives then obtained a search warrant for the burner cellphone and the rest of the residence. Upon searching the contents of the cellphone, the detectives found evidence that indicated drug trafficking in the following text messages/conversations: 1) Incoming Text: ‘Can you bring me a 10 at all?’ 2) Incoming Text: ‘This Vinz?’ Reply: ‘Yea.’ 3) Incoming Text: ‘You got a gram?’ Reply: ‘Yea.’ 4) Incoming Text: Will you bring it down?’ Reply: ‘Got u [sic].’ One reply sent from the cellphone, ostensibly from Phifer, also mentioned payment for drugs using cellphone cash applications such as Venmo and Paypal. As previously stated, Detectives Snyder and Nawman testified that they believed ‘Vinz’ was a nickname for Phifer, whose first name is ‘Venzer,’ which supported an inference that the cellphone belonged to Phifer, who used it for drug transactions. Both detectives also testified that they were unaware of any other individuals in the illegal drug trade in Springfield, Ohio, with the nickname ‘Vinz.’ Hagans, Phifer’s girlfriend, testified on his behalf at trial. While Hagans testified that the burner cellphone belonged to Browning, she also testified that Phifer slept and kept his belongings on the sofa under which the cellphone and baggie of methamphetamine were found. Hagans also testified and that it was Browning, not Phifer, that the detectives observed conducting a drug transaction with the individuals in the blue vehicle in front of the residence. Phifer argues that the evidence adduced by the State was insufficient to convict him because it was entirely circumstantial. We have held, however, that a defendant may be convicted based on direct evidence, circumstantial evidence, or both. State v. Donley, 2017-Ohio-562, 85 N.E.3d 324, ¶ 178 (2d Dist.). Circumstantial evidence has the same probative value as direct evidence. State v. Jenks, 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 272, 574 N.E.2d 492 (1991), citing State v. Nicely, 39 Ohio St.3d 147, 529 N.E.2d 1236 (1988); State v. Bennett, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 24576, 2012-Ohio-194, ¶ 11. In fact, in some cases, ‘circumstantial evidence may be more certain, satisfying, and persuasive than direct evidence.’ State v. Jackson, 57 Ohio St.3d 29, 38, 565 N.E.2d 549 (1991). ‘‘A conviction based on purely circumstantial evidence is no less sound than a conviction based on direct evidence.’’ State v. Pounds, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 22469, 2008-Ohio-5384, ¶ 38, quoting State v. Howland, 12th Dist. Fayette No. 2006-08-035, 2008-Ohio-521, ¶ 32. ‘As long as the evidence would convince the average mind of the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, circumstantial evidence is sufficient to sustain a conviction.’ State v. Whitehead, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 28334, 2019-Ohio-5141, ¶ 31, citing McKnight, 107 Ohio St.3d 101, 2005-Ohio-6046, 837 N.E.2d 315, ¶ 75. In this case, the evidence, viewed in a light most favorable to the State, established that Phifer knowingly possessed and trafficked in bulk amounts of methamphetamine. Accordingly, we find that the jury’s findings of guilty on the charged offenses were supported by sufficient evidence. Furthermore, having reviewed the record, we find no merit in Phifer’s manifest-weight challenge. It is well-settled that evaluating witness credibility is primarily for the trier of fact. State v. Benton, 2d Dist. Miami No. 2010-CA-27, 2012-Ohio-4080, ¶ 7. Here, the jury reasonably credited the testimony provided by the State’s witnesses, applied that evidence and all reasonable inferences to the elements of the offense, and found Phifer guilty. Additionally, the jury was free to discredit Hagans’s testimony that the burner cellphone belonged to Browning, not Phifer, and that it was Browning, not Phifer, that the detectives observed conducting a drug transaction with the individuals in the blue vehicle in front of the residence. Having reviewed the entire record, we cannot find that the evidence weighed heavily against conviction or that a manifest miscarriage of justice occurred.\"\n}\n```"}

As previously stated, Detectives Snyder and Nawman testified that they believed ‘Vinz’ was a nickname for Phifer, whose first name is ‘Venzer,’ which supported an inference that the cellphone belonged to Phifer, who used it for drug transactions. Both detectives also testified that they were unaware of any other individuals in the illegal drug trade in Springfield, Ohio, with the nickname ‘Vinz.’ Hagans, Phifer’s girlfriend, testified on his behalf at trial. While Hagans testified that the burner cellphone belonged to Browning, she also testified that Phifer slept and kept his belongings on the sofa under which the cellphone and baggie of methamphetamine were found. Hagans also testified and that it was Browning, not Phifer, that the detectives observed conducting a drug transaction with the individuals in the blue vehicle in front of the residence. Phifer argues that the evidence adduced by the State was insufficient to convict him because it was entirely circumstantial. We have held, however, that a defendant may be convicted based on direct evidence, circumstantial evidence, or both. State v. Donley, 2017-Ohio-562, 85 N.E.3d 324, ¶ 178 (2d Dist.). Circumstantial evidence has the same probative value as direct evidence. State v. Jenks, 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 272, 574 N.E.2d 492 (1991), citing State v. Nicely, 39 Ohio St.3d 147, 529 N.E.2d 1236 (1988); State v. Bennett, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 24576, 2012-Ohio-194, ¶ 11. In fact, in some cases, ‘circumstantial evidence may be more certain, satisfying, and persuasive than direct evidence.’ State v. Jackson, 57 Ohio St.3d 29, 38, 565 N.E.2d 549 (1991). ‘‘A conviction based on purely circumstantial evidence is no less sound than a conviction based on direct evidence.’’ State v. Pounds, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 22469, 2008-Ohio-5384, ¶ 38, quoting State v. Howland, 12th Dist. Fayette No. 2006-08-035, 2008-Ohio-521, ¶ 32. ‘As long as the evidence would convince the average mind of the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, circumstantial evidence is sufficient to sustain a conviction.’ State v. Whitehead, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 28334, 2019-Ohio-5141, ¶ 31, citing McKnight, 107 Ohio St.3d 101, 2005-Ohio-6046, 837 N.E.2d 315, ¶ 75. In this case, the evidence, viewed in a light most favorable to the State, established that Phifer knowingly possessed and trafficked in bulk amounts of methamphetamine. Accordingly, we find that the jury’s findings of guilty on the charged offenses were supported by sufficient evidence. Furthermore, having reviewed the record, we find no merit in Phifer’s manifest-weight challenge. It is well-settled that evaluating witness credibility is primarily for the trier of fact. State v. Benton, 2d Dist. Miami No. 2010-CA-27, 2012-Ohio-4080, ¶ 7. Here, the jury reasonably credited the testimony provided by the State’s witnesses, applied that evidence and all reasonable inferences to the elements of the offense, and found Phifer guilty. Additionally, the jury was free to discredit Hagans’s testimony that the burner cellphone belonged to Browning, not Phifer, and that it was Browning, not Phifer, that the detectives observed conducting a drug transaction with the individuals in the blue vehicle in front of the residence. Having reviewed the entire record, we cannot find that the evidence weighed heavily against conviction or that a manifest miscarriage of justice occurred.\"\n}\n```"}

Thomas maintains that the testimony regarding prior conduct lacked corroboration, and was factually and temporally unrelated to the conduct on trial. Evidence of other acts or crimes is not admissible to prove “a defendant’s character as to criminal propensity.” State v. Clinton, 153 Ohio St.3d 422, 2017-Ohio-9423, 108 N.E.3d 1, ¶ 96, citing Evid.R. 404(B). Such evidence, however, is “admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.” Evid.R. 404(B); see also R.C. 2945.59 (permitting other acts evidence to demonstrate motive or intent, mistake or accident, or a scheme, plan, or system in committing the offense at issue). “The language of Evid.R. 404(B) indicates that the list of purposes for which evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts may be admitted is not an exhaustive listing.” State v. Morris, 132 Ohio St.3d 337, 2012-Ohio-2407, 972 N.E.2d 528, ¶ 18. In considering the admissibility of 404(B) evidence, a court must consider whether the evidence is relevant, whether it is offered for a legitimate purpose, and whether the probative value substantially outweighs the danger of unfair prejudice. State v. Williams, 134 Ohio St.3d 521, 2012-Ohio-5695, 983 N.E.2d 1278, ¶ 20. We review a decision to permit 404(B) evidence under an abuse of discretion standard. Morris at ¶ 19. To find an abuse of discretion, we must find more than an error of law or judgment, and that the admission of other-acts evidence was “unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable.” Blakemore v. Blakemore, 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 450 N.E.2d 1140 (1983). At trial, the court precluded some of the intended other-acts testimony as unrelated to the crimes charged, but permitted testimony regarding Thomas’s prior acts of domestic violence against R.I. At trial, R.I. and others testified regarding past incidents of physical abuse and injury, including a burn to R.I.’s hand with a hot knife, a head injury resulting from a strike with a pistol butt, and a black eye. R.I. also testified that Thomas choked her on numerous occasions, sometimes until she lost consciousness, with her attempts to resist only prolonging the abuse. On the date at issue, R.I. testified that she did not want to have sex with Thomas, but knew that he would stay and persist until she gave in, and she wanted the abuse to end and for Thomas to leave. This testimony was relevant, because it provided context for the rape and tended to explain R.I.’s lack of resistance by demonstrating Thomas’s use of physical abuse, past and present, to force her compliance. “It is a well-known rule that, while consent negatives rape, where a woman is affected by terror or is in fear of great bodily injury and harm, brought into being by an accused, who has placed his victim within his power and control, intercourse under such circumstances without consent is rape, even though the victim might have used greater physical resistance or cried out, when it is shown that her will was overcome by the fear or duress.” State v. Rupp, 7th Dist. Mahoning No. 05MA166, 2007-Ohio-1561, ¶ 26, quoting State v. Martin, 77 Ohio App.553, 554, 68 N.E.2d 807 (9th Dist.1946). Based on this relevance, the trial court correctly permitted this evidence for a legitimate purpose, and not merely to impugn Thomas’s character. The other-acts evidence admitted by the trial court, furthermore, did not pertain to incidents so remote in time and circumstance to render that testimony irrelevant to the intended purpose. “While other acts evidence may be admissible, its probative value becomes attenuated as the distance in time and the nature of the act become more remote.” State v. Moran, 6th Dist. Wood No. WD-11-042, 2013-Ohio-724, ¶ 18. In this case, the evidence pertained to similar conduct toward R.I. during the course of their relationship, and therefore was neither remote nor attenuated. Finally, the other-acts evidence was not unduly prejudicial. All evidence that tended to prove the state’s case was prejudicial to Thomas, but exclusion was only required for evidence that was unfairly prejudicial. State v. Crotts, 104 Ohio St.3d 432, 2004-Ohio-6550, 820 N.E.2d 302, ¶ 23. “Unfair prejudice is that quality of evidence which might result in an improper basis for a jury decision.” Crotts at ¶ 24. Therefore, if the danger of unfair prejudice outweighed the probative value of other-acts evidence, the trial court should have ruled that evidence inadmissible. Williams, 2012-Ohio-5695, ¶ 24. Here, Thomas argues that evidence of prior conduct was unduly prejudicial, without addressing either the relevance of this evidence or the purpose for which the state proffered the evidence. The trial court gave limiting instructions to the jury following testimony, and again at the close of the state’s case in chief as follows: Now that [other-acts] evidence was received for a very limited purpose, it was not received and you may not consider it to prove the character of the [Thomas] in order to show that he acted in conformity with that character. If you find that the evidence of other wrongs is true and that [Thomas] committed them, you may consider that evidence only for the purpose of deciding whether it proves that [R.I.’s] will was overcome by fear and may explain her lack of resistance to the sexual assault. Therefore, evidence that may or may not be relevant regarding the element of force, that’s an essential element of the charge of Rape that you will have further instructions on when we get to that point in the trial. So that evidence can not be considered by you for any other purpose. Thomas dismisses the trial court’s limiting instruction as ineffective, with no argument or authority offered in support of this conclusion. Contrary to Thomas’s position, the trial court properly gave a limiting instruction, and “[i]t is presumed that the jury followed the instructions of the court.” State v. Williams, 73 Ohio St.3d 153, 159, 652 N.E.2d 821 (1995), citing State v. Murphy, 65 Ohio St.3d 554, 584, 605 N.E.2d 884 (1992). Considering the record, the trial court properly considered the relevance of proffered evidence, as well as the purpose for which the state sought to introduce that evidence, and weighed the probative value against the danger of unfair prejudice. In admitting some of that evidence, the trial court also cautioned the jury regarding the limited purpose for which they might consider that evidence. Therefore, we do not find that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting the evidence of prior acts, pursuant to Evid.R. 404(B), and Thomas’s first assignment of error is not well-taken.\"\n}\n```"}

All evidence that tended to prove the state’s case was prejudicial to Thomas, but exclusion was only required for evidence that was unfairly prejudicial. State v. Crotts, 104 Ohio St.3d 432, 2004-Ohio-6550, 820 N.E.2d 302, ¶ 23. “Unfair prejudice is that quality of evidence which might result in an improper basis for a jury decision.” Crotts at ¶ 24. Therefore, if the danger of unfair prejudice outweighed the probative value of other-acts evidence, the trial court should have ruled that evidence inadmissible. Williams, 2012-Ohio-5695, ¶ 24. Here, Thomas argues that evidence of prior conduct was unduly prejudicial, without addressing either the relevance of this evidence or the purpose for which the state proffered the evidence. The trial court gave limiting instructions to the jury following testimony, and again at the close of the state’s case in chief as follows: Now that [other-acts] evidence was received for a very limited purpose, it was not received and you may not consider it to prove the character of the [Thomas] in order to show that he acted in conformity with that character. If you find that the evidence of other wrongs is true and that [Thomas] committed them, you may consider that evidence only for the purpose of deciding whether it proves that [R.I.’s] will was overcome by fear and may explain her lack of resistance to the sexual assault. Therefore, evidence that may or may not be relevant regarding the element of force, that’s an essential element of the charge of Rape that you will have further instructions on when we get to that point in the trial. So that evidence can not be considered by you for any other purpose. Thomas dismisses the trial court’s limiting instruction as ineffective, with no argument or authority offered in support of this conclusion. Contrary to Thomas’s position, the trial court properly gave a limiting instruction, and “[i]t is presumed that the jury followed the instructions of the court.” State v. Williams, 73 Ohio St.3d 153, 159, 652 N.E.2d 821 (1995), citing State v. Murphy, 65 Ohio St.3d 554, 584, 605 N.E.2d 884 (1992). Considering the record, the trial court properly considered the relevance of proffered evidence, as well as the purpose for which the state sought to introduce that evidence, and weighed the probative value against the danger of unfair prejudice. In admitting some of that evidence, the trial court also cautioned the jury regarding the limited purpose for which they might consider that evidence. Therefore, we do not find that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting the evidence of prior acts, pursuant to Evid.R. 404(B), and Thomas’s first assignment of error is not well-taken.\"\n}\n```"}

Pursuant to Crim.R. 44(A) and (C), a defendant, 'after being fully advised of his right to assigned counsel, [may] knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waive * * * his right to counsel. * * * Waiver of counsel shall be in open court and the advice and waiver shall be recorded as provided in Rule 22. In addition, in serious offense cases the waiver shall be in writing.' However, 'courts are to indulge in every reasonable presumption against the waiver of * * * the right to be represented by counsel.' State v. Dyer, 117 Ohio App.3d 92, 95, 689 N.E.2d 1034 (2d Dist.1996). For a waiver of counsel to be knowing, intelligent, and voluntary, it'must be made with an apprehension of the nature of the charges, the statutory offenses included within them, the range of allowable punishments thereunder, possible defenses to the charges and circumstances in mitigation thereof, and all other facts essential to a broad understanding of the whole matter.' Von Moltke v. Gillies, 332 U.S. 708, 724, 68 S.Ct. 316, 92 L.Ed. 309 (1948). In the case at hand, Suells made it clear to the court throughout these proceedings that, although he knew he was not a lawyer, he wanted to represent himself and he wanted a trial. The court — in painstaking detail at times — made it clear to Suells that, although defending himself was his right, 'I can only give you my most strongest [sic] opinion on how foolish that would be.' At his court proceeding on June 21, 2018, Suells reiterated that he wanted to represent himself. At that time, he was being represented by his second court-appointed attorney, and the court asked him, 'Are you still on board with Mr. Schlachet representing you?' Suells replied, 'No, I want to be my own lawyer.' The court reviewed the written waiver of counsel with Suells at this proceeding. The court and defense counsel also discussed the sexually violent predator specifications that Suells was charged with and how convictions of these specifications result in life imprisonment. Suells’s attorney at the time gave him a copy of the Ohio Revised Code, the Ohio Jury instruction, and case annotations on sexually violent predator specifications. The court also reviewed the alternative of a plea bargain with Suells, although Suells told the court that a 'plea bargain is out of the question * * *.' The court nonetheless informed Suells of this option, stating that he was facing 'a very lengthy prison sentence,' and a plea bargain would likely result in 'lesser prison time.' The court held another hearing on the record on July 26, 2018, at which Suells was represented by his third attorney. Suells continued to maintain that he wanted to represent himself, although he had not yet sign the written waiver of counsel. Another hearing was held on August 2, 2018, to 'formalize for the record' Suells’s intent to waive his right to counsel and proceed pro se. The court reviewed the written waiver with Suells again. The court asked Suells if he had any questions about what constitutional rights he was giving up. Suells replied, 'No, I do not.' The court reviewed Suells’s indictment, including each charge, the degree of each felony, and each specification. The court particularly focused on the sexually violent predator specifications, each of which included a 'life tail' of imprisonment with the court making 'a determination as to the eligibility of parole. It could be ten, 20, 30, 40 years to life at this point in time.' The court, the prosecutor, and the defense attorney explained to Suells that the sexually violent predator specifications would have to run consecutively, but the prison sentences for convictions of other offenses could be run consecutively or concurrently, at the court’s discretion. The court explained that some of the counts, particularly kidnapping, could merge for sentencing, but that other counts, particularly having a weapon while under disability, would not merge for sentencing. The court also talked about the three-year sentence for the firearm specifications running consecutive and prior to the underlying sentences, using the following example: 'Let’s just assume for the sake of argument that he’s found guilty on Count 1 alone as it was indicted. So am I to understand that it would be a — the sentence would be 13 to life?' The state and defense attorney agreed that this was correct. The court explained the sexual motivation specification and how, if Suells was found guilty of this, it would require sexual offender'reporting' upon his potential release from prison. The court continued to explain the charges and sentencing to Suells: 'Counts 1, 3, and 6 are all counts of rape and they are all punishable by a potential term of incarceration of ten to life, but with the three-year firearm specification, you have to serve three years prior to and consecutive to the imposition of that ten to life sentence which would effectively be 13 to life.' The court then explained the details about the kidnapping charges in Counts 2, 4, and 7; the weapons charges in Counts 5 and 10; and the aggravated burglary charges in Counts 8 and 9. The court concluded that Suells was facing a maximum stated sentence of life in prison with parole eligibility after 92 years. The court explained that, if Suells represented himself at trial, he was entitled to have'standby' or advisory counsel, but that Ohio law prohibited hybrid representation. The court inquired into whether Suells was aware of the 'facts and evidence that the State intends to introduce at trial' and made sure that Suells had received the state’s discovery materials. The court also reviewed with Suells the 'beyond a reasonable doubt' burden of proof under which the state must present its case against him. The court next reviewed with Suells the 'potential legal defenses' that he may raise on his behalf, and the court instructed Suells that it was his burden to raise these defenses should they apply. The court detailed the following: failure to produce evidence; impeachment testimony; motions to suppress (both evidence and statements); state and federal constitutional violations; motions in limine; affirmative defenses, including self-defense, alibi, and speedy trial; motions to dismiss; and suppression of evidence. The court also reviewed with Suells that he would be responsible, just as an attorney would be, for complying with the rules of evidence and criminal procedure. The court accepted the written waiver of counsel that Suells signed and reminded him that his trial was set for August 13, 2018. At Suells’s request, the court authorized funds for a defense investigator and, to the extent of its authority, made 'the appropriate advisement' that Suells could use the jail’s law library to prepare for his case. In reviewing waivers of counsel at the trial-court level, this court has held the following: 'Although there is no prescribed colloquy in which the trial court and a pro se defendant must engage before a defendant may waive his right to counsel, the court must ensure that the defendant is voluntarily electing to proceed pro se and that the defendant is knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waiving the right to counsel. Given the presumption against waiving a constitutional right, the trial court must ensure the defendant is aware of 'the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation' and that he is making the decision with his 'eyes open.' (Citation omitted.) State v. Buchanon, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 80098, 2003-Ohio-6851, ¶ 16. See also State v. Gibson, 45 Ohio St.2d 366, 378, 345 N.E.2d 399 (1976) (holding the following regarding waiver of counsel: 'And while, in retrospection we may question the wisdom of such a decision, as indeed the defendant has, we are satisfied that it was validly made. The trial court conducted a complete inquiry which did comport with the accepted standards of laying a foundation to accept a waiver of counsel and the defendant knowingly and intelligently exercised his rights'). In the instant case, the court held multiple hearings regarding Suells’s request to represent himself at trial. The court appointed a series of three defense attorneys and urged Suells, repeatedly, to allow one of these attorneys to represent him, cautioning Suells of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation. For example, the court stated the following to Suells: 'I know I shared this with you last time, you wouldn’t be your own dentist, pull your own tooth. You wouldn’t be your own surgeon to take care of a health issue. You go to the expert to do that for you. So while you may think that you and only you would be in the best position to represent yourself, again, all I can do — and I think I have the obligation to suggest to you in the strongest way possible that that’s a terrible idea; but if that’s what you choose to do, I can’t stop you from doing it.' Upon review, we find that Suells unambiguously asserted his right to self-representation. The record shows that Suells was literate, competent, and acting under his own free will. The court complied with its duty to inform Suells about, and inquire into Suells’s understanding of, the nature of the charges, the statutory offenses, the potential penalties, and the possible defenses. Suells has failed to show that his waiver of counsel was not knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently made. Accordingly, the court did not err in granting Suells’s request to represent himself at trial, and his first assigned error is overruled.\"\n}\n```"}

At that time, he was being represented by his second court-appointed attorney, and the court asked him, 'Are you still on board with Mr. Schlachet representing you?' Suells replied, 'No, I want to be my own lawyer.' The court reviewed the written waiver of counsel with Suells at this proceeding. The court and defense counsel also discussed the sexually violent predator specifications that Suells was charged with and how convictions of these specifications result in life imprisonment. Suells’s attorney at the time gave him a copy of the Ohio Revised Code, the Ohio Jury instruction, and case annotations on sexually violent predator specifications. The court also reviewed the alternative of a plea bargain with Suells, although Suells told the court that a 'plea bargain is out of the question * * *.' The court nonetheless informed Suells of this option, stating that he was facing 'a very lengthy prison sentence,' and a plea bargain would likely result in 'lesser prison time.' The court held another hearing on the record on July 26, 2018, at which Suells was represented by his third attorney. Suells continued to maintain that he wanted to represent himself, although he had not yet sign the written waiver of counsel. Another hearing was held on August 2, 2018, to 'formalize for the record' Suells’s intent to waive his right to counsel and proceed pro se. The court reviewed the written waiver with Suells again. The court asked Suells if he had any questions about what constitutional rights he was giving up. Suells replied, 'No, I do not.' The court reviewed Suells’s indictment, including each charge, the degree of each felony, and each specification. The court particularly focused on the sexually violent predator specifications, each of which included a 'life tail' of imprisonment with the court making 'a determination as to the eligibility of parole. It could be ten, 20, 30, 40 years to life at this point in time.' The court, the prosecutor, and the defense attorney explained to Suells that the sexually violent predator specifications would have to run consecutively, but the prison sentences for convictions of other offenses could be run consecutively or concurrently, at the court’s discretion. The court explained that some of the counts, particularly kidnapping, could merge for sentencing, but that other counts, particularly having a weapon while under disability, would not merge for sentencing. The court also talked about the three-year sentence for the firearm specifications running consecutive and prior to the underlying sentences, using the following example: 'Let’s just assume for the sake of argument that he’s found guilty on Count 1 alone as it was indicted. So am I to understand that it would be a — the sentence would be 13 to life?' The state and defense attorney agreed that this was correct. The court explained the sexual motivation specification and how, if Suells was found guilty of this, it would require sexual offender'reporting' upon his potential release from prison. The court continued to explain the charges and sentencing to Suells: 'Counts 1, 3, and 6 are all counts of rape and they are all punishable by a potential term of incarceration of ten to life, but with the three-year firearm specification, you have to serve three years prior to and consecutive to the imposition of that ten to life sentence which would effectively be 13 to life.' The court then explained the details about the kidnapping charges in Counts 2, 4, and 7; the weapons charges in Counts 5 and 10; and the aggravated burglary charges in Counts 8 and 9. The court concluded that Suells was facing a maximum stated sentence of life in prison with parole eligibility after 92 years. The court explained that, if Suells represented himself at trial, he was entitled to have'standby' or advisory counsel, but that Ohio law prohibited hybrid representation. The court inquired into whether Suells was aware of the 'facts and evidence that the State intends to introduce at trial' and made sure that Suells had received the state’s discovery materials. The court also reviewed with Suells the 'beyond a reasonable doubt' burden of proof under which the state must present its case against him. The court next reviewed with Suells the 'potential legal defenses' that he may raise on his behalf, and the court instructed Suells that it was his burden to raise these defenses should they apply. The court detailed the following: failure to produce evidence; impeachment testimony; motions to suppress (both evidence and statements); state and federal constitutional violations; motions in limine; affirmative defenses, including self-defense, alibi, and speedy trial; motions to dismiss; and suppression of evidence. The court also reviewed with Suells that he would be responsible, just as an attorney would be, for complying with the rules of evidence and criminal procedure. The court accepted the written waiver of counsel that Suells signed and reminded him that his trial was set for August 13, 2018. At Suells’s request, the court authorized funds for a defense investigator and, to the extent of its authority, made 'the appropriate advisement' that Suells could use the jail’s law library to prepare for his case. In reviewing waivers of counsel at the trial-court level, this court has held the following: 'Although there is no prescribed colloquy in which the trial court and a pro se defendant must engage before a defendant may waive his right to counsel, the court must ensure that the defendant is voluntarily electing to proceed pro se and that the defendant is knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waiving the right to counsel. Given the presumption against waiving a constitutional right, the trial court must ensure the defendant is aware of 'the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation' and that he is making the decision with his 'eyes open.' (Citation omitted.) State v. Buchanon, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 80098, 2003-Ohio-6851, ¶ 16. See also State v. Gibson, 45 Ohio St.2d 366, 378, 345 N.E.2d 399 (1976) (holding the following regarding waiver of counsel: 'And while, in retrospection we may question the wisdom of such a decision, as indeed the defendant has, we are satisfied that it was validly made. The trial court conducted a complete inquiry which did comport with the accepted standards of laying a foundation to accept a waiver of counsel and the defendant knowingly and intelligently exercised his rights'). In the instant case, the court held multiple hearings regarding Suells’s request to represent himself at trial. The court appointed a series of three defense attorneys and urged Suells, repeatedly, to allow one of these attorneys to represent him, cautioning Suells of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation. For example, the court stated the following to Suells: 'I know I shared this with you last time, you wouldn’t be your own dentist, pull your own tooth. You wouldn’t be your own surgeon to take care of a health issue. You go to the expert to do that for you. So while you may think that you and only you would be in the best position to represent yourself, again, all I can do — and I think I have the obligation to suggest to you in the strongest way possible that that’s a terrible idea; but if that’s what you choose to do, I can’t stop you from doing it.' Upon review, we find that Suells unambiguously asserted his right to self-representation. The record shows that Suells was literate, competent, and acting under his own free will. The court complied with its duty to inform Suells about, and inquire into Suells’s understanding of, the nature of the charges, the statutory offenses, the potential penalties, and the possible defenses. Suells has failed to show that his waiver of counsel was not knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently made. Accordingly, the court did not err in granting Suells’s request to represent himself at trial, and his first assigned error is overruled.\"\n}\n```"}

In reviewing waivers of counsel at the trial-court level, this court has held the following: 'Although there is no prescribed colloquy in which the trial court and a pro se defendant must engage before a defendant may waive his right to counsel, the court must ensure that the defendant is voluntarily electing to proceed pro se and that the defendant is knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waiving the right to counsel. Given the presumption against waiving a constitutional right, the trial court must ensure the defendant is aware of 'the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation' and that he is making the decision with his 'eyes open.' (Citation omitted.) State v. Buchanon, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 80098, 2003-Ohio-6851, ¶ 16. See also State v. Gibson, 45 Ohio St.2d 366, 378, 345 N.E.2d 399 (1976) (holding the following regarding waiver of counsel: 'And while, in retrospection we may question the wisdom of such a decision, as indeed the defendant has, we are satisfied that it was validly made. The trial court conducted a complete inquiry which did comport with the accepted standards of laying a foundation to accept a waiver of counsel and the defendant knowingly and intelligently exercised his rights'). In the instant case, the court held multiple hearings regarding Suells’s request to represent himself at trial. The court appointed a series of three defense attorneys and urged Suells, repeatedly, to allow one of these attorneys to represent him, cautioning Suells of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation. For example, the court stated the following to Suells: 'I know I shared this with you last time, you wouldn’t be your own dentist, pull your own tooth. You wouldn’t be your own surgeon to take care of a health issue. You go to the expert to do that for you. So while you may think that you and only you would be in the best position to represent yourself, again, all I can do — and I think I have the obligation to suggest to you in the strongest way possible that that’s a terrible idea; but if that’s what you choose to do, I can’t stop you from doing it.' Upon review, we find that Suells unambiguously asserted his right to self-representation. The record shows that Suells was literate, competent, and acting under his own free will. The court complied with its duty to inform Suells about, and inquire into Suells’s understanding of, the nature of the charges, the statutory offenses, the potential penalties, and the possible defenses. Suells has failed to show that his waiver of counsel was not knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently made. Accordingly, the court did not err in granting Suells’s request to represent himself at trial, and his first assigned error is overruled.\"\n}\n```"}

Pursuant to Crim.R. 44(A) and (C), a defendant, 'after being fully advised of his right to assigned counsel, [may] knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waive * * * his right to counsel. * * * Waiver of counsel shall be in open court and the advice and waiver shall be recorded as provided in Rule 22. In addition, in serious offense cases the waiver shall be in writing.' However, 'courts are to indulge in every reasonable presumption against the waiver of * * * the right to be represented by counsel.' State v. Dyer, 117 Ohio App.3d 92, 95, 689 N.E.2d 1034 (2d Dist.1996). For a waiver of counsel to be knowing, intelligent, and voluntary, it'must be made with an apprehension of the nature of the charges, the statutory offenses included within them, the range of allowable punishments thereunder, possible defenses to the charges and circumstances in mitigation thereof, and all other facts essential to a broad understanding of the whole matter.' Von Moltke v. Gillies, 332 U.S. 708, 724, 68 S.Ct. 316, 92 L.Ed. 309 (1948). In the case at hand, Suells made it clear to the court throughout these proceedings that, although he knew he was not a lawyer, he wanted to represent himself and he wanted a trial. The court — in painstaking detail at times — made it clear to Suells that, although defending himself was his right, 'I can only give you my most strongest [sic] opinion on how foolish that would be.' At his court proceeding on June 21, 2018, Suells reiterated that he wanted to represent himself. At that time, he was being represented by his second court-appointed attorney, and the court asked him, 'Are you still on board with Mr. Schlachet representing you?' Suells replied, 'No, I want to be my own lawyer.' The court reviewed the written waiver of counsel with Suells at this proceeding. The court and defense counsel also discussed the sexually violent predator specifications that Suells was charged with and how convictions of these specifications result in life imprisonment. Suells’s attorney at the time gave him a copy of the Ohio Revised Code, the Ohio Jury instruction, and case annotations on sexually violent predator specifications. The court also reviewed the alternative of a plea bargain with Suells, although Suells told the court that a 'plea bargain is out of the question * * *.' The court nonetheless informed Suells of this option, stating that he was facing 'a very lengthy prison sentence,' and a plea bargain would likely result in 'lesser prison time.' The court held another hearing on the record on July 26, 2018, at which Suells was represented by his third attorney. Suells continued to maintain that he wanted to represent himself, although he had not yet sign the written waiver of counsel. Another hearing was held on August 2, 2018, to 'formalize for the record' Suells’s intent to waive his right to counsel and proceed pro se. The court reviewed the written waiver with Suells again. The court asked Suells if he had any questions about what constitutional rights he was giving up. Suells replied, 'No, I do not.' The court reviewed Suells’s indictment, including each charge, the degree of each felony, and each specification. The court particularly focused on the sexually violent predator specifications, each of which included a 'life tail' of imprisonment with the court making 'a determination as to the eligibility of parole. It could be ten, 20, 30, 40 years to life at this point in time.' The court, the prosecutor, and the defense attorney explained to Suells that the sexually violent predator specifications would have to run consecutively, but the prison sentences for convictions of other offenses could be run consecutively or concurrently, at the court’s discretion. The court explained that some of the counts, particularly kidnapping, could merge for sentencing, but that other counts, particularly having a weapon while under disability, would not merge for sentencing. The court also talked about the three-year sentence for the firearm specifications running consecutive and prior to the underlying sentences, using the following example: 'Let’s just assume for the sake of argument that he’s found guilty on Count 1 alone as it was indicted. So am I to understand that it would be a — the sentence would be 13 to life?' The state and defense attorney agreed that this was correct. The court explained the sexual motivation specification and how, if Suells was found guilty of this, it would require sexual offender'reporting' upon his potential release from prison. The court continued to explain the charges and sentencing to Suells: 'Counts 1, 3, and 6 are all counts of rape and they are all punishable by a potential term of incarceration of ten to life, but with the three-year firearm specification, you have to serve three years prior to and consecutive to the imposition of that ten to life sentence which would effectively be 13 to life.' The court then explained the details about the kidnapping charges in Counts 2, 4, and 7; the weapons charges in Counts 5 and 10; and the aggravated burglary charges in Counts 8 and 9. The court concluded that Suells was facing a maximum stated sentence of life in prison with parole eligibility after 92 years. The court explained that, if Suells represented himself at trial, he was entitled to have'standby' or advisory counsel, but that Ohio law prohibited hybrid representation. The court inquired into whether Suells was aware of the 'facts and evidence that the State intends to introduce at trial' and made sure that Suells had received the state’s discovery materials. The court also reviewed with Suells the 'beyond a reasonable doubt' burden of proof under which the state must present its case against him. The court next reviewed with Suells the 'potential legal defenses' that he may raise on his behalf, and the court instructed Suells that it was his burden to raise these defenses should they apply. The court detailed the following: failure to produce evidence; impeachment testimony; motions to suppress (both evidence and statements); state and federal constitutional violations; motions in limine; affirmative defenses, including self-defense, alibi, and speedy trial; motions to dismiss; and suppression of evidence. The court also reviewed with Suells that he would be responsible, just as an attorney would be, for complying with the rules of evidence and criminal procedure. The court accepted the written waiver of counsel that Suells signed and reminded him that his trial was set for August 13, 2018. At Suells’s request, the court authorized funds for a defense investigator and, to the extent of its authority, made 'the appropriate advisement' that Suells could use the jail’s law library to prepare for his case.

The same tripartite test applies for determining whether a trial court has abused its discretion in admitting other evidence that was not properly disclosed under Crim.R. 16. *State v. Scudder*, 71 Ohio St.3d 263, 269, 21994-Ohio-298, 643 N.E.2d 524(1994).\\n\\nAn abuse of discretion can be found where the reasons given by the court for its action are clearly untenable, legally incorrect, or amount to a denial of justice, or where the judgment reaches an end or purpose not justified by reason and the evidence. *Tennant v. Gallick*, 9th Dist. Summit No. 26827, 2014-Ohio-477, ¶35; *In re Guardianship of S.H.*, 9th Dist. Medina No. 13CA0066–M, 2013–Ohio–4380, ¶ 9; *State v. Firouzmandi*, 5th Dist. Licking No.2006–CA–41, 2006–Ohio–5823, ¶54.\\n\\n**ISSUE FOR APPEAL**\\n\\n*Whether the trial court abused its discretion by overruling Shanklin’s motion to dismiss.*\\n\\nAs the state correctly notes, the trial court never ruled on Shanklin’s motion. When a trial court fails to rule upon a motion, it is presumed the trial court overruled such motion. *State ex rel. The V Companies v. Marshall*, 81 Ohio St.3d 467, 469, 692 N.E.2d 198(1998); *Newman v. Al Castrucci Ford Sales, Inc.*, 54 Ohio App.3d 166, 561 N.E.2d 1001(1988), par. 4 of the syllabus; *State v. Pincheck*, 5th Dist. Tuscarawas No. 97AP090058, 1999 WL 174925 (Mar. 18, 1999). In light of this presumption, we find Shanklin’s motion was overruled by the trial court.\\n\\nIn his Motion to Dismiss filed in the trial court on March 30, 2018, Shanklin alleged that trial was scheduled to begin on April 4, 2018. He further noted that the state had provided additional discovery on: March 19, 2018 of the 9-1-1 recordings made on June 22, 2017; on March 20, 2018 two CD’s of video evidence collected in June 2017; on March 27, 2018 a CD of coroner photos and a CD of the video interviews of Tullis White, Ronald Shanklin, Norman Randolph, Eric Thomsen, Courtney Burns and Anthony Brewton [See, Docket No. 64]; on March 28, 2018 the BCI lab reports concerning the Sig Sauer [See, Docket Number 65]; and on March 30, 2018 jail call records. [See, Docket No. 66]. See, Motion to Dismiss, filed March 30, 2018 [Docket Number 68].\\n\\n{¶46} The state provides no explanation for the delay in providing this evidence to the defense, in some cases less than one week before trial, when at least some of the evidence had been collected at or near the time of the crime in June 2017.\\n\\n{¶47} Nothing in the record affirmatively shows that the discovery violations here were willful, as opposed to unintentional. It does not appear from the record before us, and Shanklin does not elucidate how foreknowledge of any of the evidence would have benefited his defense. It does not appear, and Shanklin does not specifically argue any prejudice ensuing from the late disclosure. In State v. Darmond, the Ohio Supreme Court noted,\\n\\nAlthough we are not mandating a specific procedural course of conduct in this case, we note that rather than dismissing the case with prejudice, the trial court could have continued the case to allow further inquiry into the details regarding the other packages. See Lakewood, 32 Ohio St.3d at 5, 511 N.E.2d 1138 (a continuance should be ordered if it is feasible and would allow for an opportunity to minimize any surprise or prejudice caused by the discovery violation). This was a bench trial, and the defendants were out on bond. Clearly, a continuance to clear up the facts of the discovery violation would have been a feasible alternative.\\n\\n135 Ohio St.3d 343, 2013-Ohio-966, 986 N.E.2d 971, ¶40.\\n\\n{¶48} Although this was a jury trial and Shanklin was incarcerated at the time, a short continuance to allow the defense time to review the discovery would not have been unreasonable; however, Shanklin never requested a continuance. ‘Instead he asked for the most stringent option—total exclusion of the testimony. In the absence of a motion for a continuance, * * * the trial court properly concluded that defense counsel was prepared to go forward at that time. * * *’ Edwards, supra, 49 Ohio St.3d at 43, 3 O.O.3d at 24–25, 358 N.E.2d at 1060.” State v. Finnerty, 45 Ohio St.3d 104, 108, 543 N.E.2d 1233(1989).\\n\\n{¶49} Contrary to Shanklin’s contentions, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in overruling his motion to dismiss.\\n\\n{¶50} Accordingly, Shanklin’s First Assignment of Error is overruled.\"\n}\n```"}

Appellant argues that Ex. B, Sheriff Pickenpaugh’s recorded conversation with Officer Stoney, was impermissible hearsay which should have been excluded. The admission of evidence is within the discretion of the trial court and the court’s decision will only be reversed upon a showing of abuse of discretion. But when no objection to evidence is raised at trial, all but plain error is waived. An alleged error is plain error only if the error is ‘obvious’ and ‘but for the error, the outcome of the trial would have been otherwise.’ Hearsay is a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Ex. B was played in its entirety at trial. In this recording, Officer Stoney informed Sheriff Pickenpaugh of all of the details of his two previous conversations with appellant. The conversations were about events between A.B. and appellant and appellant’s interview with the Noble County Sheriff’s Office. In the recording, Officer Stoney recalled from his conversations with appellant that A.B. invited appellant to her home. A.B. informed appellant that ‘nothing is going to happen, we are here to talk.’ According to Officer Stoney, appellant told him that A.B. fell asleep, appellant pulled A.B.’s pants down, and began having sex with her. A.B. told appellant to stop. Officer Stoney remembered appellant telling him that he told deputies the truth but that appellant said ‘I’m not going to tell [the Noble County Sheriff’s Office] that she told me no.’ Appellant also asked Officer Stoney how to beat a polygraph test. When Officer Stoney told appellant that the only way was to tell the truth, appellant responded that he could not do that. (Ex. B). Ex. B contained out of court statements by Officer Stoney. These statements were offered into evidence to prove the truth of the matters asserted. Namely, that A.B. told appellant they were not going to have sex and appellant began having sex with A.B. when she was asleep and after A.B. told appellant no. But the state argues that Ex. B is not hearsay under Evid.R. 801(D)(1)(b). A statement is not hearsay if ‘[t]he declarant testifies at trial or hearing and is subject to cross-examination concerning the statement, and the statement is * * * consistent with declarant’s testimony and is offered to rebut an express or implied charge against declarant of recent fabrication or improper influence or motive.’ Evid.R. 801(D)(1)(b). The state argues that appellant made a charge of recent fabrication against Officer Stoney during opening statements. During opening statements, appellant’s counsel told the jury: ‘[C]losely listen to the testimony of Mr. Stoney, and you will find out about his inner relationship not only with Mr. Hayes, but with the sheriff’s department, and what the inconsistencies are in his statement. What he told the sheriff’s department was never recorded. The evidence that he will testify to is that Mr. Hayes admitted committing the crime. However, when Mr. Hayes is clandestinely recorded, he doesn’t know they are wired up so to speak, they are having a phone call, and he doesn’t say any of the things that he told the sheriff’s department * * *.’ (Tr. 11). The comments during appellant’s opening statement are an implied charge of recent fabrication against Officer Stoney. In support of this argument, the state cites this court’s decision in State v. Johnson, 7th Dist. Mahoning No. 15 MA 0197, 2017-Ohio-7702. In Johnson, this court held that ‘attacking a victim’s credibility during opening statements is grounds for permitting a prior consistent statement into evidence pursuant to Evid.R. 801(D)(1)(b).’ Id. at ¶ 21-22 citing State v. Hunt, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 12AP-103, 2013-Ohio-5326; State v. Crawford, 5th Dist. Richland No. 07 CA 116, 2008-Ohio-6260; State v. Abdussatar, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 86406, 2006-Ohio-803. This rule also applies to witnesses who are not victims. See Hunt. Appellant’s opening statement implied to the jury that Officer Stoney told Sheriff Pickenpaugh things that appellant never said about what happened between appellant and A.B. The implication appellant’s opening statement made is that Officer Stoney recently fabricated facts. Officer Stoney testified at trial about the conversations he had with appellant concerning A.B. According to Officer Stoney, when appellant arrived at A.B.’s home, A.B. told appellant ‘nothing’s happening.’ (Tr. 105). He testified that appellant told him ‘[t]hey were in bed, and he said that she falls asleep.

FIFTH AND FOURTEENTH AMENDMENTS, UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION, ARTICLE I, SECTIONS 10 AND 16, OHIO CONSTITUTION.", "discussion": "```json\n{\n  \"discussion\": \"Appellant argues that, during closing arguments, the prosecutor improperly vouched for the victim’s credibility and accused him of lying during his testimony. Appellant concedes that he is limited to a plain error analysis as his trial counsel failed to object to the comments. Appellant believes that the jury did not find the victim credible as evidenced by their questions regarding some of the evidence. In response, the state argues that it is permitted to give an opinion during closing arguments so long as it is supported by evidence, does not imply knowledge of evidence outside of the record, and does not place the prosecutor’s credibility at issue. The state contends that Appellant admittedly lied to investigators, and the evidence at trial demonstrated that he continued to lie during his testimony. As to the comment regarding the victim, the state highlights the fact that her statements to investigators remained consistent from the time of her initial statement and throughout her trial testimony. Even if the comments were improper, the state argues that Appellant suffered no prejudice, as the nurse’s testimony demonstrated that force was used during the sexual encounter. The state refutes Appellant’s claim that the jury questioned the victim’s credibility. The comments at issue were made during the state’s closing argument. A prosecutor is afforded wide latitude during closing argument and it is within the trial court’s sound discretion to determine whether a comment is improper. When reviewing a comment made by the state, we must first determine whether the remark was proper. If the remark appears to be improper, we must then determine whether it prejudicially affected the defendant’s substantial rights. During closing arguments, the prosecutor stated: 'You have a Defendant who, when originally asked about this, says, “I didn’t sleep with that woman, no way, no how.” Lies. Lies are what come from the Defendant. He does not tell the truth. He didn’t tell the truth then. He didn’t tell the truth today. [The victim] told the truth. She has always told the truth. What does she have to gain from this, ladies and gentlemen? Nothing. But to be victimized again. To have to come here and go through this. Ladies and gentlemen, she was honest. She has been honest from day one. Her story has been consistent. Every time she was asked what happened, she told exactly what happened and she was truthful and honest. You saw the pain in her testimony, how much she has suffered from this rape. You heard from the officers about what happened that day. About their investigation, how they followed up with footage, and you saw a little bit of footage, confirmed everything that was being told to them. That they had not known each other that long. That was consistent. That they had on that day -- that she had been picked up from the library.' (Tr., pp. 432-433.) An attorney may not express a personal belief or opinion as to the credibility of a witness. However, the prosecutor may draw reasonable inferences from the evidence presented at trial, and may comment on those inferences during closing argument. When reviewing a prosecutor’s comments, a court must view the state’s closing argument in its entirety. Although a prosecutor should avoid voicing a personal opinion as to a defendant’s guilt, a comment on guilt is not per se improper. The instant comment is comparable to the one made in Peterson. Importantly, Appellant admittedly lied to police during the investigation, which was revealed during his testimony. He originally told investigators that he did not engage in intercourse with the victim. He did not admit to any sexual contact with the victim until investigators informed him that his DNA sample matched the sample obtained from the rape kit. His sole explanation for his lying was his alleged fear of police due to a claimed incident of police brutality suffered in his youth. He did not elaborate on the alleged incident. Regardless, the evidence presented at trial directly contradicted Appellant’s version of the facts. The victim’s statements during the investigation and her trial testimony was largely corroborated by the nurse examiner’s testimony that the injuries suffered by the victim were consistent with force and inconsistent with consensual intercourse. Thus, while a prosecutor should avoid such comments whenever possible, the comment regarding Appellant’s truthfulness was not improper. The state’s second comment addressed the victim’s credibility. It is improper for a prosecutor to vouch for the credibility of a witness at trial. Vouching occurs when the prosecutor implies knowledge of facts outside the record or places his or her personal credibility in issue. Again, the state relied on evidence already in the record when making a comment as to the victim. The victim’s statements to investigators remained consistent throughout the investigation. Law enforcement was able to corroborate her statements through surveillance videos, the nurse’s examination, and the rape kit evidence. There is no indication that the state’s comment was based on evidence outside the record and the state did not imply such outside knowledge. Further, there is nothing within the record to suggest that the prosecutor placed her own credibility at issue. As such, the prosecutor did not improperly vouch for the victim’s credibility. Even assuming, arguendo, that the state’s comments were improper, such comments do not affect a substantial right of the accused if it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury would have found the defendant guilty even without the improper comments. This case represents the unusual case where the defendant testified at trial and the jury was able to determine his credibility on their own. While Appellant argues that the length of the jury deliberations and the questions the jury asked about the evidence somehow indicates that the jury questioned the victim’s credibility, such claim is speculative at best. Both Appellant and the victim testified, as did others who corroborated the victim’s version of events. This was a matter of credibility and the jury clearly determined that they believed the victim.\"\n}\n```"}

In response, the state argues that it is permitted to give an opinion during closing arguments so long as it is supported by evidence, does not imply knowledge of evidence outside of the record, and does not place the prosecutor’s credibility at issue. The state contends that Appellant admittedly lied to investigators, and the evidence at trial demonstrated that he continued to lie during his testimony. As to the comment regarding the victim, the state highlights the fact that her statements to investigators remained consistent from the time of her initial statement and throughout her trial testimony. Even if the comments were improper, the state argues that Appellant suffered no prejudice, as the nurse’s testimony demonstrated that force was used during the sexual encounter.

Appellant argues that the fact he armed himself with a gun for his own protection because he anticipated a possibility of violence does not equate to 'a scheme designed to implement a calculated decision to kill[,] and that the State failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt this element of aggravated murder. The State contends the jury verdict, including the finding of prior calculation and design, was supported by the testimony introduced at trial. A claim of insufficient evidence invokes a due process concern and raises the question whether the evidence is legally sufficient to support the verdict as a matter of law. *State v. Thompkins*, 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 386, 678 N.E.2d 541 (1997). When reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, an appellate court's inquiry focuses primarily upon the adequacy of the evidence; that is, whether the evidence, if believed, reasonably could support a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. *Thompkins*, syllabus. The standard of review is whether, after viewing the probative evidence and inferences reasonably drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found all the essential elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. *E.g.*, *Jackson v. Virginia*, 443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781 (1979); *State v. Jenks*, 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 273, 574 N.E.2d 492 (1991). Furthermore, a reviewing court is not to assess 'whether the state's evidence is to be believed, but whether, if believed, the evidence against a defendant would support a conviction.' *Thompkins* at 390. Thus, when reviewing a sufficiency of the evidence claim, an appellate court must construe the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution. *E.g.*, *State v. Hill*, 75 Ohio St.3d 195, 205, 661 N.E.2d 1068 (1996); *State v. Grant*, 67 Ohio St.3d 465, 477, 620 N.E.2d 50 (1993). A reviewing court will not overturn a conviction on a sufficiency of the evidence claim unless reasonable minds could not reach the conclusion that the trier of fact did. *State v. Tibbetts*, 92 Ohio St.3d 146, 162, 749 N.E.2d 226 (2001); *State v. Treesh*, 90 Ohio St.3d 460, 484, 739 N.E.2d 749 (2001). Here, after our review of the record, we believe the State presented sufficient evidence to support the finding of prior calculation and design. The jury convicted Appellant of aggravated murder in violation of R.C. 2923.01(A), which provides that 'no person shall purposely, and with prior calculation and design, cause the death of another * * *.' Appellant does not contest, under this assignment of error, that the State established that he purposely caused the death of the victim, Sammy Nicholson. Instead, he limits his argument to a claim that the State did not introduce sufficient evidence that he acted with prior calculation and design. 'The phrase 'prior calculation and design' by its own terms suggests advance reasoning to formulate the purpose to kill. Evidence of an act committed on the spur of the moment or after momentary consideration is not evidence of a premeditated decision or a studied consideration of the method and the means to cause a death.' *State v. Walker*, 150 Ohio St.3d 409, 2016-Ohio-8295, 82 N.E.2d 1124, ¶18; see also *State v. Wilks*, 154 Ohio St.3d 359, 2018-Ohio-1562, 114 N.E.3d 1092, ¶151. As this Court recently observed in State v. Phillips, 4th Dist. Scioto No. 18CA3832, 2018-Ohio-5432, at ¶28, 'there are three factors courts generally consider to determine whether a defendant acted with prior calculation and design: (1) Did the accused and victim know each other, and if so, was that relationship strained? (2) Did the accused give thought or preparation to choosing the murder weapon or murder site? and (3) Was the act drawn out or an almost instantaneous eruption of events?' Walker at ¶20. Although these factors provide guidelines, there is no bright-line test for prior calculation and design, and each case instead turns upon the particular evidence introduced at trial. Walker at ¶19; State v. McWay, 3d Dist. Allen No. 1-17-42, 2018-Ohio-3618, ¶16. Here, regarding the first factor, the State presented evidence that established Appellant and the victim knew one another and had a 'business relationship' to the extent they cooperated with one another in the illegal sale of drugs. Further, the State introduced evidence indicating their relationship had recently become strained because Appellant owed the victim $700.00 for drugs that were 'fronted' to him to sell. Regarding the second factor, the State introduced evidence in the form of a text message that included a photo of Appellant's gun (the gun used in the murder), along with a comment stating Appellant needed to go 'take care of some b.s.' The evidence introduced at trial indicated Appellant sent this message from his phone to more than one individual the evening prior to the murder. The record further reveals that Appellant borrowed a vehicle to drive to the victim's residence at 5:00 in the morning, allegedly to pay him the money that was owed. However, instead of leaving the money in a grill outside the victim's apartment, as had been customary in the past, Appellant went into the victim's apartment with a loaded gun on his person. Additional evidence indicated an unspent bullet, of the same type used in the murder, was found in the vehicle Appellant drove, which supports an inference that he loaded the gun just prior to either driving to, or entering, the victim's residence. Finally, with respect to the final factor which considers the duration of the events at issue, the State argued Appellant went to the victim's residence with a mission and that he walked in and shot the victim without a struggle. As such, the State argued the incident was an 'instantaneous eruption of events' which, in the State's view, mitigated in favor of a finding of prior calculation and design. Appellant argued that there was a struggle and that he shot the victim in self-defense after the victim shoved him to the ground. Appellant further argues that the State's theory that the murder occurred as part of an 'instantaneous eruption of events' mitigates against, rather than in favor of, a finding of prior calculation and design. In truth, it cannot be discerned from the record whether this incident was a drawn-out struggle, or whether it was an instantaneous eruption of events. The crime scene certainly indicated a struggle had taken place, but that could have been a result of the struggle between Appellant and Darrell Arnett (the victim's roommate) after the victim was murdered. In any event the first two factors indicate Appellant planned to murder the victim, rather than simply go to his apartment in the middle of the night to pay him the money that was owed. As set forth above, the factors are only guidelines and there is no bright-line test. Based upon the evidence before it, we believe the jury could justifiably conclude that Appellant was determined to complete a specific course of action. Thus, the jury's aggravated murder conviction, including their finding of prior calculation and design, was supported by sufficient evidence. Accordingly, Appellant’s first assignment of error is overruled.\"\n}\n```"}

When reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, an appellate court's inquiry focuses primarily upon the adequacy of the evidence; that is, whether the evidence, if believed, reasonably could support a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. *Thompkins*, syllabus. The standard of review is whether, after viewing the probative evidence and inferences reasonably drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found all the essential elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. *E.g.*, *Jackson v. Virginia*, 443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781 (1979); *State v. Jenks*, 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 273, 574 N.E.2d 492 (1991). Furthermore, a reviewing court is not to assess 'whether the state's evidence is to be believed, but whether, if believed, the evidence against a defendant would support a conviction.' *Thompkins* at 390. Thus, when reviewing a sufficiency of the evidence claim, an appellate court must construe the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution. *E.g.*, *State v. Hill*, 75 Ohio St.3d 195, 205, 661 N.E.2d 1068 (1996); *State v. Grant*, 67 Ohio St.3d 465, 477, 620 N.E.2d 50 (1993). A reviewing court will not overturn a conviction on a sufficiency of the evidence claim unless reasonable minds could not reach the conclusion that the trier of fact did. *State v. Tibbetts*, 92 Ohio St.3d 146, 162, 749 N.E.2d 226 (2001); *State v. Treesh*, 90 Ohio St.3d 460, 484, 739 N.E.2d 749 (2001). Here, after our review of the record, we believe the State presented sufficient evidence to support the finding of prior calculation and design. The jury convicted Appellant of aggravated murder in violation of R.C. 2923.01(A), which provides that 'no person shall purposely, and with prior calculation and design, cause the death of another * * *.' Appellant does not contest, under this assignment of error, that the State established that he purposely caused the death of the victim, Sammy Nicholson. Instead, he limits his argument to a claim that the State did not introduce sufficient evidence that he acted with prior calculation and design. 'The phrase 'prior calculation and design' by its own terms suggests advance reasoning to formulate the purpose to kill. Evidence of an act committed on the spur of the moment or after momentary consideration is not evidence of a premeditated decision or a studied consideration of the method and the means to cause a death.' *State v. Walker*, 150 Ohio St.3d 409, 2016-Ohio-8295, 82 N.E.2d 1124, ¶18; see also *State v. Wilks*, 154 Ohio St.3d 359, 2018-Ohio-1562, 114 N.E.3d 1092, ¶151. As this Court recently observed in State v. Phillips, 4th Dist. Scioto No. 18CA3832, 2018-Ohio-5432, at ¶28, 'there are three factors courts generally consider to determine whether a defendant acted with prior calculation and design: (1) Did the accused and victim know each other, and if so, was that relationship strained? (2) Did the accused give thought or preparation to choosing the murder weapon or murder site? and (3) Was the act drawn out or an almost instantaneous eruption of events?' Walker at ¶20. Although these factors provide guidelines, there is no bright-line test for prior calculation and design, and each case instead turns upon the particular evidence introduced at trial. Walker at ¶19; State v. McWay, 3d Dist. Allen No. 1-17-42, 2018-Ohio-3618, ¶16. Here, regarding the first factor, the State presented evidence that established Appellant and the victim knew one another and had a 'business relationship' to the extent they cooperated with one another in the illegal sale of drugs. Further, the State introduced evidence indicating their relationship had recently become strained because Appellant owed the victim $700.00 for drugs that were 'fronted' to him to sell. Regarding the second factor, the State introduced evidence in the form of a text message that included a photo of Appellant's gun (the gun used in the murder), along with a comment stating Appellant needed to go 'take care of some b.s.' The evidence introduced at trial indicated Appellant sent this message from his phone to more than one individual the evening prior to the murder. The record further reveals that Appellant borrowed a vehicle to drive to the victim's residence at 5:00 in the morning, allegedly to pay him the money that was owed. However, instead of leaving the money in a grill outside the victim's apartment, as had been customary in the past, Appellant went into the victim's apartment with a loaded gun on his person. Additional evidence indicated an unspent bullet, of the same type used in the murder, was found in the vehicle Appellant drove, which supports an inference that he loaded the gun just prior to either driving to, or entering, the victim's residence. Finally, with respect to the final factor which considers the duration of the events at issue, the State argued Appellant went to the victim's residence with a mission and that he walked in and shot the victim without a struggle. As such, the State argued the incident was an 'instantaneous eruption of events' which, in the State's view, mitigated in favor of a finding of prior calculation and design. Appellant argued that there was a struggle and that he shot the victim in self-defense after the victim shoved him to the ground. Appellant further argues that the State's theory that the murder occurred as part of an 'instantaneous eruption of events' mitigates against, rather than in favor of, a finding of prior calculation and design. In truth, it cannot be discerned from the record whether this incident was a drawn-out struggle, or whether it was an instantaneous eruption of events. The crime scene certainly indicated a struggle had taken place, but that could have been a result of the struggle between Appellant and Darrell Arnett (the victim's roommate) after the victim was murdered. In any event the first two factors indicate Appellant planned to murder the victim, rather than simply go to his apartment in the middle of the night to pay him the money that was owed. As set forth above, the factors are only guidelines and there is no bright-line test. Based upon the evidence before it, we believe the jury could justifiably conclude that Appellant was determined to complete a specific course of action. Thus, the jury's aggravated murder conviction, including their finding of prior calculation and design, was supported by sufficient evidence. Accordingly, Appellant’s first assignment of error is overruled.\"\n}\n```"}

The standard of review is whether, after viewing the probative evidence and inferences reasonably drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found all the essential elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. *E.g.*, *Jackson v. Virginia*, 443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781 (1979); *State v. Jenks*, 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 273, 574 N.E.2d 492 (1991). Furthermore, a reviewing court is not to assess 'whether the state's evidence is to be believed, but whether, if believed, the evidence against a defendant would support a conviction.' *Thompkins* at 390. Thus, when reviewing a sufficiency of the evidence claim, an appellate court must construe the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution. *E.g.*, *State v. Hill*, 75 Ohio St.3d 195, 205, 661 N.E.2d 1068 (1996); *State v. Grant*, 67 Ohio St.3d 465, 477, 620 N.E.2d 50 (1993). A reviewing court will not overturn a conviction on a sufficiency of the evidence claim unless reasonable minds could not reach the conclusion that the trier of fact did. *State v. Tibbetts*, 92 Ohio St.3d 146, 162, 749 N.E.2d 226 (2001); *State v. Treesh*, 90 Ohio St.3d 460, 484, 739 N.E.2d 749 (2001). Here, after our review of the record, we believe the State presented sufficient evidence to support the finding of prior calculation and design. The jury convicted Appellant of aggravated murder in violation of R.C. 2923.01(A), which provides that 'no person shall purposely, and with prior calculation and design, cause the death of another * * *.' Appellant does not contest, under this assignment of error, that the State established that he purposely caused the death of the victim, Sammy Nicholson. Instead, he limits his argument to a claim that the State did not introduce sufficient evidence that he acted with prior calculation and design. 'The phrase 'prior calculation and design' by its own terms suggests advance reasoning to formulate the purpose to kill. Evidence of an act committed on the spur of the moment or after momentary consideration is not evidence of a premeditated decision or a studied consideration of the method and the means to cause a death.' *State v. Walker*, 150 Ohio St.3d 409, 2016-Ohio-8295, 82 N.E.2d 1124, ¶18; see also *State v. Wilks*, 154 Ohio St.3d 359, 2018-Ohio-1562, 114 N.E.3d 1092, ¶151. As this Court recently observed in State v. Phillips, 4th Dist. Scioto No. 18CA3832, 2018-Ohio-5432, at ¶28, 'there are three factors courts generally consider to determine whether a defendant acted with prior calculation and design: (1) Did the accused and victim know each other, and if so, was that relationship strained? (2) Did the accused give thought or preparation to choosing the murder weapon or murder site? and (3) Was the act drawn out or an almost instantaneous eruption of events?' Walker at ¶20. Although these factors provide guidelines, there is no bright-line test for prior calculation and design, and each case instead turns upon the particular evidence introduced at trial. Walker at ¶19; State v. McWay, 3d Dist. Allen No. 1-17-42, 2018-Ohio-3618, ¶16. Here, regarding the first factor, the State presented evidence that established Appellant and the victim knew one another and had a 'business relationship' to the extent they cooperated with one another in the illegal sale of drugs. Further, the State introduced evidence indicating their relationship had recently become strained because Appellant owed the victim $700.00 for drugs that were 'fronted' to him to sell. Regarding the second factor, the State introduced evidence in the form of a text message that included a photo of Appellant's gun (the gun used in the murder), along with a comment stating Appellant needed to go 'take care of some b.s.' The evidence introduced at trial indicated Appellant sent this message from his phone to more than one individual the evening prior to the murder. The record further reveals that Appellant borrowed a vehicle to drive to the victim's residence at 5:00 in the morning, allegedly to pay him the money that was owed. However, instead of leaving the money in a grill outside the victim's apartment, as had been customary in the past, Appellant went into the victim's apartment with a loaded gun on his person. Additional evidence indicated an unspent bullet, of the same type used in the murder, was found in the vehicle Appellant drove, which supports an inference that he loaded the gun just prior to either driving to, or entering, the victim's residence. Finally, with respect to the final factor which considers the duration of the events at issue, the State argued Appellant went to the victim's residence with a mission and that he walked in and shot the victim without a struggle. As such, the State argued the incident was an 'instantaneous eruption of events' which, in the State's view, mitigated in favor of a finding of prior calculation and design. Appellant argued that there was a struggle and that he shot the victim in self-defense after the victim shoved him to the ground. Appellant further argues that the State's theory that the murder occurred as part of an 'instantaneous eruption of events' mitigates against, rather than in favor of, a finding of prior calculation and design. In truth, it cannot be discerned from the record whether this incident was a drawn-out struggle, or whether it was an instantaneous eruption of events. The crime scene certainly indicated a struggle had taken place, but that could have been a result of the struggle between Appellant and Darrell Arnett (the victim's roommate) after the victim was murdered. In any event the first two factors indicate Appellant planned to murder the victim, rather than simply go to his apartment in the middle of the night to pay him the money that was owed. As set forth above, the factors are only guidelines and there is no bright-line test. Based upon the evidence before it, we believe the jury could justifiably conclude that Appellant was determined to complete a specific course of action. Thus, the jury's aggravated murder conviction, including their finding of prior calculation and design, was supported by sufficient evidence. Accordingly, Appellant’s first assignment of error is overruled.\"\n}\n```"}

Section 2923.11(A) of the Revised Code defines a ‘Deadly Weapon’ as ‘any instrument, device, or thing capable of inflicting death, and designed or specially adapted for use as a weapon, or possessed, carried, or used as a weapon.’ ‘An instrument, no matter how innocuous when not in use, is a deadly weapon if it is of sufficient size and weight to inflict death upon a person, when the instrument is wielded against the body of the victim or threatened to be so wielded.’ State v.

Even if the BB’s are not powerful enough to cause death, a BB gun can be a deadly weapon if used as a bludgeon. State v. Bitting, 9th Dist. Summit No. 2017-Ohio-2955, ¶ 13. See State v. Smith, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 94167, 2011-Ohio-306, ¶ 25 (finding that whether a ‘real’ looking toy gun or a real gun was used to commit aggravated robbery was not dispositive because the evidence established that the fear of the victims was of such a nature that they were induced to part with their property against their will). If no evidence is presented to show that a BB gun can be lethal in its use, it cannot be presumed to be capable of inflicting death. Johnson, supra, 2015-Ohio-3113, ¶ 50 citing State v. Brown, 101 Ohio App.3d 784 (1st Dist.1995). Here, the State presented testimony from Officer Kunkleman, the Lima law enforcement officer who found the black BB gun in the SUV where Junod had been hiding. Officer Kunkleman stated that first he thought the gun was the same type of weapon he carries on duty, a Sig Sauer P226 9 millimeter. It was not until he picked up the gun, did he then realize that it was in fact a BB gun because it had a CO2 cartridge instead of a magazine. He further explained that the BB gun was not as heavy as his pistol, but it also was not light. Officer Kunkleman testified that based on his experience and training ‘[a] BB gun can inflict physical serious [sic] harm at close range by shooting an eye out, puncture your skin, it can cause physical harm to you.’ (Trial Tr. at 280). He further stated that a BB gun could indeed cause death. Officer Kunkleman testified that a BB gun could be used in a manner other than shooting, ‘you could use it to hit somebody, just like you would a bat or anything else like that.’ (Trial Tr. at 280-81). In addition, Officer Waltmire testified that the specific BB gun found in the SUV was ‘a Powerline pellet gun.177 range.’ (Id. at 408). He further stated that he was familiar with cases in which a similar gun has caused death. He explained that the BB gun can be ‘used to fire, using air cartridge to fire pellets that would cause serious injury or death, could be used as a blunt force object, it could be used for many different ways.’ (Id.). There was also a considerable amount of evidence presented establishing that Ms. Jones believed the gun Junod used during the robbery was a ‘real’ firearm. Aside from Ms. Jones’ testimony stating that she was terrified and felt like her life was being threatened, the 9-1-1 call Ms. Jones made after the robbery was also admitted as an exhibit. On this recording, her voice is shaky and she is clearly overwhelmed by fear. Testimony from the law enforcement officers who encountered Ms. Jones at the scene described her as ‘very shaken,’ ‘quivering,’ ‘very traumatized,’ ‘nervous,’ and ‘it took a while for her to get to the point of calming down.’ (Trial Tr. at 331, 379-80). Based on the foregoing discussion, we find that the testimony along with the exhibits presented at trial constitute ample evidence to support the jury’s finding that the BB gun used by Junod during the commission of the Aggravated Robbery is a deadly weapon as defined by R.C. 2923.11(A). Accordingly, we conclude that Junod’s conviction for Aggravated Robbery is not against the manifest weight and the fourth assignment of error is overruled.\"\n}\n```"}

Cuyahoga No. 94167, 2011-Ohio-306, ¶ 25 (finding that whether a ‘real’ looking toy gun or a real gun was used to commit aggravated robbery was not dispositive because the evidence established that the fear of the victims was of such a nature that they were induced to part with their property against their will). If no evidence is presented to show that a BB gun can be lethal in its use, it cannot be presumed to be capable of inflicting death. Johnson, supra, 2015-Ohio-3113, ¶ 50 citing State v. Brown, 101 Ohio App.3d 784 (1st Dist.1995). Here, the State presented testimony from Officer Kunkleman, the Lima law enforcement officer who found the black BB gun in the SUV where Junod had been hiding. Officer Kunkleman stated that first he thought the gun was the same type of weapon he carries on duty, a Sig Sauer P226 9 millimeter. It was not until he picked up the gun, did he then realize that it was in fact a BB gun because it had a CO2 cartridge instead of a magazine. He further explained that the BB gun was not as heavy as his pistol, but it also was not light. Officer Kunkleman testified that based on his experience and training ‘[a] BB gun can inflict physical serious [sic] harm at close range by shooting an eye out, puncture your skin, it can cause physical harm to you.’ (Trial Tr. at 280). He further stated that a BB gun could indeed cause death. Officer Kunkleman testified that a BB gun could be used in a manner other than shooting, ‘you could use it to hit somebody, just like you would a bat or anything else like that.’ (Trial Tr. at 280-81). In addition, Officer Waltmire testified that the specific BB gun found in the SUV was ‘a Powerline pellet gun.177 range.’ (Id. at 408). He further stated that he was familiar with cases in which a similar gun has caused death. He explained that the BB gun can be ‘used to fire, using air cartridge to fire pellets that would cause serious injury or death, could be used as a blunt force object, it could be used for many different ways.’ (Id.). There was also a considerable amount of evidence presented establishing that Ms. Jones believed the gun Junod used during the robbery was a ‘real’ firearm. Aside from Ms. Jones’ testimony stating that she was terrified and felt like her life was being threatened, the 9-1-1 call Ms. Jones made after the robbery was also admitted as an exhibit. On this recording, her voice is shaky and she is clearly overwhelmed by fear. Testimony from the law enforcement officers who encountered Ms. Jones at the scene described her as ‘very shaken,’ ‘quivering,’ ‘very traumatized,’ ‘nervous,’ and ‘it took a while for her to get to the point of calming down.’ (Trial Tr. at 331, 379-80). Based on the foregoing discussion, we find that the testimony along with the exhibits presented at trial constitute ample evidence to support the jury’s finding that the BB gun used by Junod during the commission of the Aggravated Robbery is a deadly weapon as defined by R.C. 2923.11(A). Accordingly, we conclude that Junod’s conviction for Aggravated Robbery is not against the manifest weight and the fourth assignment of error is overruled.\"\n}\n```"}

The court finds sufficient evidence that St. John inflicted the injuries to Brayden that led to his death. The State presented evidence that Brayden was behaving normally on Sunday, February 12, 2017, and upon awaking on the morning of Monday, February 13, 2017. Kelsie testified that Brayden told her that he needed to use the bathroom, and that she and Brayden then used the bathroom. Kelsie placed Brayden in her bed; he whined that he did not want Kelsie to leave. There is no indication that Brayden was injured prior to Kelsie’s leaving for the courthouse. St. John’s statements to Detective Bruss also indicated that Brayden was fine when Kelsie left. The State’s evidence established that St. John was alone with Brayden and his infant son until Kelsie returned at approximately 10:30 a.m. Based on the CT scan and his observations of fresh blood during surgery, Dr. Kamian concluded that Brayden’s injuries would have been inflicted approximately three to six hours before the surgery, which began at approximately 2:10 p.m. Dr. Shott testified that the injury to Brayden’s abdomen likely would have caused Brayden to have abdominal pain and to vomit; St. John texted Kelsie at shortly after 9:00 a.m. that Brayden had spit or thrown up. Dr. Vavul-Roediger testified that Brayden would have become ‘immediately symptomatic’ from the head injury. She indicated that Brayden would not have been behaving normally, interactive, talkative, and walking. The State’s evidence indicated that Brayden could have been lucid for a period of time after the brain injury, but both Dr. Vavul-Roediger and Dr. Shott stated Brayden would have become unconscious from the brain swelling. St. John’s statements to Detective Bruss indicated that Brayden expressed that he was sleepy and that he remained in bed. Kelsie testified that when she returned at approximately 10:15 a.m., she observed that Brayden appeared to be asleep, and he remained in the same position until she found him, unresponsive, shortly before 1:00 p.m. In short, although there was no direct evidence that St. John inflicted the injuries to Brayden, there was substantial circumstantial evidence that he committed the offenses. The State’s evidence regarding Brayden’s behavior on February 12-13, 2017, the nature of his injuries, the expected symptoms of the injuries, and the timing of the injuries established that Brayden’s injuries occurred during the period of time when Kelsie was addressing her traffic court issues and when St. John was the only adult in the apartment with Brayden. St. John’s actions in leaving the apartment as the police arrived and in avoiding contact with the police for the rest of that day could have indicated a consciousness of guilt on St. John’s part. In addition, Middleton testified that St. John later confessed to slamming Brayden’s head against the wall and throwing Brayden to the ground after Kelsie left for traffic court; Middleton provided specific details of what allegedly had occurred in the apartment, details that were not released to the public by the police and were consistent with other evidence at trial. St. John acknowledged in a subsequent phone call to family members that he had spoken with Middleton. The State’s evidence was sufficient to support the jury’s guilty verdicts on two counts of felony murder, involuntary manslaughter, felonious assault, and endangering children (serious physical harm).\"\n}\n```"}

Kelsie testified that Brayden told her that he needed to use the bathroom, and that she and Brayden then used the bathroom.

St. John’s statements to Detective Bruss also indicated that Brayden was fine when Kelsie left. The State’s evidence established that St. John was alone with Brayden and his infant son until Kelsie returned at approximately 10:30 a.m. Based on the CT scan and his observations of fresh blood during surgery, Dr. Kamian concluded that Brayden’s injuries would have been inflicted approximately three to six hours before the surgery, which began at approximately 2:10 p.m. Dr. Shott testified that the injury to Brayden’s abdomen likely would have caused Brayden to have abdominal pain and to vomit; St. John texted Kelsie at shortly after 9:00 a.m. that Brayden had spit or thrown up. Dr. Vavul-Roediger testified that Brayden would have become ‘immediately symptomatic’ from the head injury. She indicated that Brayden would not have been behaving normally, interactive, talkative, and walking. The State’s evidence indicated that Brayden could have been lucid for a period of time after the brain injury, but both Dr. Vavul-Roediger and Dr. Shott stated Brayden would have become unconscious from the brain swelling. St. John’s statements to Detective Bruss indicated that Brayden expressed that he was sleepy and that he remained in bed. Kelsie testified that when she returned at approximately 10:15 a.m., she observed that Brayden appeared to be asleep, and he remained in the same position until she found him, unresponsive, shortly before 1:00 p.m. In short, although there was no direct evidence that St. John inflicted the injuries to Brayden, there was substantial circumstantial evidence that he committed the offenses. The State’s evidence regarding Brayden’s behavior on February 12-13, 2017, the nature of his injuries, the expected symptoms of the injuries, and the timing of the injuries established that Brayden’s injuries occurred during the period of time when Kelsie was addressing her traffic court issues and when St. John was the only adult in the apartment with Brayden. St. John’s actions in leaving the apartment as the police arrived and in avoiding contact with the police for the rest of that day could have indicated a consciousness of guilt on St. John’s part. In addition, Middleton testified that St. John later confessed to slamming Brayden’s head against the wall and throwing Brayden to the ground after Kelsie left for traffic court; Middleton provided specific details of what allegedly had occurred in the apartment, details that were not released to the public by the police and were consistent with other evidence at trial. St. John acknowledged in a subsequent phone call to family members that he had spoken with Middleton.

Plain error exists where there is an obvious deviation from a legal rule that affected the defendant's substantial rights by influencing the outcome of the proceedings. State v. Barnes, 94 Ohio St.3d 21, 27 (2002). 'Plain error does not exist unless it can be said that but for the error, the outcome of the trial would clearly have been otherwise.' State v. Biros, 78 Ohio St.3d 426, 436 (1997). This court should notice plain error with the utmost caution, under exceptional circumstances and only to prevent a miscarriage of justice. State v. Widmer, 12th Dist. Warren No. CA2011-03-027, 2012-Ohio-4342, ¶ 84. Joinder of defendants and the avoidance of multiple trials is favored in the law. State v. Thomas, 61 Ohio St.2d 223, 225 (1980). Joinder conserves judicial and prosecutorial time, lessens the considerable expense of multiple trials, diminishes inconvenience to witnesses, and minimizes the possibility of incongruous results in successive trials before different juries. Id. '[J]oinder of defendants is proper so long as all defendants participated in the same series of transactions leading to the charges even though not all defendants participated in every act. *** Not all defendants need be charged in each count *** nor would differing levels of culpability among defendants necessarily justify severance.' State v. Schiebel, 55 Ohio St.3d 71, 88-89 (1990). Crim.R. 14 permits a trial court to grant separate trials if joinder has a prejudicial effect on the accused. However, the accused bears the burden of proving that prejudice. State v. Coley, 93 Ohio St.3d 253, 259 (2001). 'The test is 'whether a joint trial is so manifestly prejudicial that the trial judge is required to exercise his or her discretion in only one way – by severing the trial. * * * A defendant must show clear, manifest and undue prejudice and violation of a substantive right resulting from failure to sever.'\" Schiebel at 89, quoting United States v. Castro, 887 F.2d 988, 996 (9th Cir.1989). Lester argues that his joint trial deprived him of a fair trial because jurors could have been confused or misled by prejudicial evidence that was only relevant to William's convictions. Lester also argues that his defense was prejudiced because William was permitted to 'leap frog' Lester's defense case with one of William's witnesses. Finally, Lester argues that jurors may have found him guilty merely by his familial association with William. This case involved a conspiracy to commit arson that resulted in a homicide. The state necessarily had to submit evidence of Lester's and William's individual actions in furtherance of the conspiracy to establish its case. Accordingly, much of the evidence that would have been relevant and admissible in a stand-alone trial against William would also have been relevant and admissible in a stand-alone trial against Lester. To the extent there was some evidence solely related to William's charges, there is no evidence in the record to support Lester's argument that the jurors were unable to differentiate that evidence from evidence solely attributable to Lester. In this regard, the court specifically instructed the jury on the concept of separate evidence and that it should only consider evidence as it relates to each defendant. This court presumes that jurors followed the instructions provided by the trial court. State v. Vunda, 12th Dist. Butler Nos. CA2012-07-130 and CA2013-07-113, 2014-Ohio-3449, ¶ 73. There is no merit to the assertion that jurors may have found Lester guilty simply because of a familial association. As will be addressed in the next assignment of error, the jury convicted Lester on substantial circumstantial evidence. Finally, there is no support in the record for the argument that jurors could have been confused by the presentation of William's witness, Kim Brooks, before Lester's defense case. Kim was one of William's girlfriends and was with him on the day of the fire. The record indicates that Kim was a reluctant witness and William's counsel had to expend considerable effort to obtain her appearance. Kim did appear on the sixth day of the trial and after the state had closed its case. Although Lester was entitled to present his defense case before William, the parties and court agreed that William could call Kim before Lester's defense case to ensure that she testified. After Kim testified, Lester requested that William continue his defense case. The state objected to that request and the court denied it. Lester does not articulate how Kim's out-of-turn appearance prejudiced him other than to argue that it 'compounded the conflation of issues.' It is unclear how Kim's out-of-turn testimony could have prejudiced Lester's defense case or deprived him of a fair trial. Kim had no direct knowledge of Lester's involvement in the conspiracy. On this record, Lester has not demonstrated that his joint trial was manifestly prejudicial, nor has he established plain error. This court overrules Lester's first assignment of error.\"\n}\n```"}

Kim did appear on the sixth day of the trial and after the state had closed its case.

As he did in the trial court below, appellant urges that the statements he made to Colwell at the March 15, 2016 interview should have been suppressed because they were either (a) uttered while he was subject to custodial interrogation without having been informed of his *Miranda* rights, or (b) solicited after appellant was informed of his *Miranda* rights and had invoked his right to counsel. The trial court found that the evidence obtained from Colwell’s interview of appellant was not subject to suppression because appellant was not in custody during the interview. The trial court took particular note of the fact that appellant was permitted to leave the interview room without question or incident as soon as he expressed a desire to terminate the conversation. Although the interview room door was locked during the interview, the trial court noted that appellant was unaware of that fact, and further found that nothing in the record would have led appellant to objectively believe that he would not be permitted to leave the interview upon request. Consequently, the trial court denied appellant’s motion to suppress. Appellant also contends that the trial court committed reversible error in failing to suppress his post-*Miranda* statements elicited after he indicated that he 'probably' needed an attorney. The state contends that appellant failed to clearly and unambiguously invoke his right to counsel when he indicated to Colwell that he probably needed an attorney. The state asserts that Colwell’s continued questioning was permissible, and his post-*Miranda* statements were not subject to suppression.

{"Index": "636-Paige", "allegation_num": "allegation_1", "allegation": "Testimony relating to out of court, testimonial statements, violated Appellant’s constitutional right to confront witnesses as guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Art. I, Section 10 of the Ohio Constitution.", "discussion": "```json\n{\n  \"discussion\": \"Appellant contends the testimony of Det./Sgts. Spotleson and Martin regarding the statements Fletcher made to them during police interviews constituted testimonial hearsay in violation of his right to confront witnesses guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause. The state contends the testimony of Det./Sgts. Spotleson and Martin was for the purpose of explaining their conduct during the investigatory process and that the probative value of the evidence was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. The trial court typically has broad discretion in admitting or excluding evidence. However, a de novo standard of review is applied to a claim that a criminal defendant's rights have been violated under the Confrontation Clause. Pursuant to the Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause, 'in all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right * * * to be confronted with the witnesses against him.' Testimonial statements of a non-testifying witness are inadmissible unless the witness was unavailable to testify and the defendant had a prior opportunity for cross-examination of the witness. In Crawford, the Supreme Court declined to provide a comprehensive definition of 'testimonial,' but indicated that the term includes, at a minimum, prior testimony at a preliminary hearing, before a grand jury, at a former trial, and statements made during police interrogations. In Davis, the Supreme Court held that statements are nontestimonial for Confrontation Clause purposes when made in the course of a police interrogation under such circumstances that indicate objectively the primary purpose of the interrogation is to enable police to address an ongoing emergency. Testimonial statements occur when the circumstances objectively indicate that there is no ongoing emergency and the primary purpose of the interrogation is to establish or prove past events that are potentially relevant to a future criminal prosecution. Hence, we must distinguish between police interrogations that are part of an ongoing emergency and interrogations related to past criminal conduct and which serve only to investigate potential criminal prosecution. Appellant claims the testimony of two witnesses give rise to Confrontation Clause issues: the direct testimony of Det./Sgt. Spotleson and the direct testimony of Det./Sgt. Martin. Det./Sgt. Spotleson was lead investigator on the case and was assisted by Det./Sgt. Martin. Both were present during the interviews of Appellant and Fletcher. Det./Sgt. Spotleson provided most of the testimony to which Appellant objects. As noted above, during direct examination Det./Sgt. Spotleson was asked a number of questions regarding statements Fletcher made during her two interviews with police. At the outset it should be noted that, although the first interview was conducted on the same day as the incident, albeit several hours later, and the second interview was conducted the following morning, neither interview can be characterized as addressing an emergency situation. Fletcher was a person of interest during her first interview. At the conclusion of Fletcher’s first interview, Appellant was also a person of interest. At the time of the second interview, both Fletcher and Appellant had been placed under arrest. In the absence of an ongoing emergency, the statements made by Fletcher to police were made under circumstances that objectively indicate there was 'no such ongoing emergency, and that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.' Siler at ¶ 24, quoting Davis, at 822. The state contends the testimony of the detectives was 'offered to explain an officer’s conduct while investigating a crime' and thus, are not hearsay and do not violate the Confrontation Clause. We do not find this reasoning persuasive, particularly when considering the testimony elicited from Det./Sgt. Spotleson regarding his first interview of Fletcher: Q And you interviewed [Fletcher]? A Yes Q Did she tell you that she was present when this occurred? A Yes Q Did she identify a second person of interest? A Yes Q And who was that? A Michael Paige (1/3/17 Tr., p. 312.) In Ricks, the Ohio Supreme Court held that an officer’s testimony regarding the out-of-court statements of an alleged accomplice identifying the defendant as the assailant violated the Confrontation Clause when the accomplice did not testify at trial. In contrast, in Johnson, the investigating officer interviewed a witness named Wright. Wright invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege at the defendant’s trial. During defendant’s trial, the officer testified that Wright had given her a description of both the vehicle involved in the shooting and the shooter. During this testimony the officer did not repeat those descriptions. The Eighth District held that since the officer did not testify as to the exact statements of Wright, there was no Confrontation Clause violation. The state also presented the testimony of the decedent’s mother, Andrea, who had spoken to Wright about her son’s death: [STATE]: Why don’t you tell us about the following day. Did you meet with [Wright]? [ANDREA]: Yeah, the following day I guess he wanted to tell me who— [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Objection. THE COURT: Well, why don’t we caution [Andrea]. One of the rules in court is that you can’t tell us what somebody else said. [STATE]: We went over the rules a little bit before your testimony *** about hearsay. You can’t talk about what someone else told you, right? So I don’t want you to say the words that [Wright] said, right? [ANDREA]: Right [STATE]: Did [Wright] tell you what happened? [ANDREA]: Yes. [STATE]: And without telling us what he said, did he tell you who had done it? [ANDREA]: Yes. [STATE]: Did he give you one name or more than one? [ANDREA]: He gave me [the] first and last name *** of one person. [STATE]: Again, [Andrea], I don’t want to go into specifics about what he said, but did he tell you how it happened and how [Ayers] died? [ANDREA]: Yes. Johnson at ¶ 40. The Eighth District likewise held in regard to this testimony that since the actual information the witness had learned from Wright was not disclosed during testimony, the testimony was not offered to prove the circumstances of the decedent’s death but only to explain how the case unfolded. Hence, it was not testimonial hearsay. Id. at ¶ 41. The line of questioning in the instant case more closely reflects the situation found in Ricks, and not Johnson, as Appellee claims. Rather than testifying only to Det./Sgt. Spotleson’s 'conduct while investigating a crime,' the testimony goes further, eliciting testimony about the identification of Appellant by his codefendant. Blevins at 149. When testifying as to Fletcher's first interview, not only did Det./Sgt. Spotleson relate the questions he asked her, he testified that she gave the officer Appellant's name as a person involved in the crime. Regarding Fletcher's second interview, after she was shown the video of Appellant's interview implicating her as the shooter, Det./Sgt. Spotleson testified that Fletcher told him where she was standing, where the victim was standing and where the shooter was standing. He repeated those exact locations. He also testified that Fletcher told him Blake did not have a gun and that she did not feel threatened by Blake during the incident. (1/3/17 Tr., pp. 320-321, 329.) At the end of his questioning, Det./Sgt. Spotleson was asked whether he had a suspect at the conclusion of Fletcher's interview. He responded in the affirmative and named Appellant. This testimony goes beyond the process used in the investigation. It goes to the heart of the fact at issue, the name of the shooter. Although not as direct as the testimony revealed as a result of the first interview, and framed in a manner that appears to explain police conduct during an investigation, it is clear that Det./Sgt. Spotleson’s testimony was offered to place before the jury Fletcher's statements implicating Appellant as the shooter, and not simply to demonstrate how the investigation was conducted. Det./Sgt. Martin testified as a witness for Appellant. He was called to testify regarding the search of Appellant's residence, which failed to elicit an actual weapon, as well as to Appellant's gun powder residue test results, which were negative. On cross-examination, the state asked Det./Sgt. Martin about Appellant’s admission that he shot Blake and whether Appellant’s admission mirrored what Fletcher said about the crime scene: Q He also told you that he killed Munir Blake, correct? A Correct. Q And did [Fletcher] corroborate that? A Yes. Q He told you that [Blake] was standing that doorway—and just so you know, the jury went to the scene, so they have seen that. The doorway going from the kitchen onto that landing, stairway landing, he also told you that [Blake] was standing in that doorway, correct? A Correct. Q And did [Fletcher] corroborate that? A Yes. Q He also told you that [Fletcher] would have been pretty much facing [Blake], correct? A Correct. Q Standing on that landing, basically pretty much straight across from each other? A He described face to face. Q Okay. And [Fletcher] also corroborated that, correct? A Correct. *** Q To the best of your knowledge, did [Fletcher] ever say that she shot and killed [Blake]? A No. (1/3/17 Tr., pp. 418-419.) Again, rather than testifying only to Det./Sgt. Martin’s 'conduct while investigating a crime' the testimony goes further and seeks to place before the jury that Fletcher corroborated Appellant’s admission. Blevins at 149. As Fletcher did not testify, the state used the officer’s testimony to put Fletcher’s statements into evidence. Under the primary purpose test set forth in Crawford and its progeny, the statements made by Fletcher during her police interrogations are testimonial in nature. The testimony given by both officers goes beyond their investigatory conduct and procedure and instead appears to be an attempt to prove the truth of the matter asserted: to identify Appellant as the assailant and to bolster Appellant’s admission. As Fletcher did not testify at trial and there was no previous opportunity for Appellant to cross-examination Fletcher, this testimony was inadmissible hearsay in violation of the Confrontation Clause. Once we determine that the testimony was admitted erroneously, our inquiry does not end here, however. We must next look at whether Appellant was harmed by this error. In Ricks, the Supreme Court held that statements made by the officer were unfairly prejudicial and the cited purpose for the testimony, police investigatory procedure, was pretextual. Ricks at ¶ 34, 45. The Ricks Court found the out-of-court statements 'exceptionally damaging' because the declarant was the other suspect in the murder. As most of the state’s evidence related to the other suspect’s involvement in the crime, the state’s case, then,'revolved' around the declarant. Id. at ¶ 36. The Ricks Court concluded the Confrontation Clause violation was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt as there existed a reasonable possibility that the testimony of the officer contributed to the defendant’s conviction. Id. at ¶ 47. Whether a Confrontation Clause violation is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt involves not merely an inquiry into the sufficiency of the remaining evidence, absent the erroneously admitted evidence, but whether there is a reasonable possibility that the violating evidence might have contributed to the resulting conviction. Id. at ¶ 46, citing Chapman v. California, 368 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967). Regarding harmless error, Crim.R. 52(A) provides that 'any error, defect, irregularity, or variance which does not affect substantial rights shall be disregarded.' See also Evid.R. 103(A) (error may not be predicated on a ruling which admits or excludes evidence unless a substantial right of the party is affected and a timely objection was made.) In order to determine whether substantial rights were affected, we must evaluate whether there was prejudice to the defendant. State v. Morris, 141 Ohio St.3d 399, 2014-Ohio-5052, 24 N.E.3d 1153, ¶ 23, 27. A court is required to review the impact of the offending evidence on the overall verdict and compare it to the strength of the other remaining evidence. Id. at ¶ 25. To determine 'whether a new trial is required or the error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, the court must excise the improper evidence from the record and then look to the remaining evidence.' Morris at ¶ 29. Moreover, 'the cases where imposition of harmless error is appropriate must involve either overwhelming evidence of guilt or some other indicia that the error did not contribute to the conviction.' State v. Rahman, 23 Ohio St.3d 146, 151, 492 N.E.2d 401 (1986), quoting State v. Ferguson, 5 Ohio St.3d 160, 166, 450 N.E.2d 265 (1983), fn. 5. The fact that most concerned the Ricks Court was that the declarant who was the subject of the officer's testimony was an accomplice, and the state's evidence centered predominately around the accomplice. In the instant case, Fletcher is also a codefendant. The same concern over utilizing the testimonial statements of a codefendant is theoretically applicable here. Both investigating detectives testified about statements made by Fletcher which placed Appellant at the scene as the shooter. In urging prejudice under the plain error standard, Appellant alleges that although he confessed to shooting Blake, the record reflects that he told several different accounts of the events that transpired. The testimony of Det./Sgts. Spotleson and Martin had the effect of bolstering his admission, by corroborating the details of the version of events (including Appellant's own) that reflect Appellant's guilt. While we are troubled by the admission of the testimony of Det./Sgts. Spotleson and Martin because the testimony went beyond what is allowable by law, the troubling nature of the testimony is considerably lessened when considering the remaining evidence presented to the jury. Excising the testimony of Det./Sgts. Spotleson and Martin, which we are required to do, this record reveals that the jury had before it overwhelming evidence of Appellant's guilt. First and foremost, the jury was shown the videotaped admission of the shooting by Appellant, where he provided a detailed description of the murder scene and of the events in his own words. His description of the incident was corroborated by the testimony of Officer Anthony Marzullo who investigated the scene. It was further corroborated by Dr. Ohr, the medical examiner who not only investigated at the scene but performed the autopsy on Blake. Further, the jury was taken to the scene of the shooting in order to better visualize the testimony presented regarding the placement of the shooter in relation to the gunshot wounds suffered by Blake. We cannot discount the inherent significance of the video confession, where the jury was able to see Appellant confessing to the crime and describing the scene in detail. Nor can we second-guess the jury’s credibility determinations in that regard. State v. Hill, 75 Ohio St.3d 195, 205, 661 N.E.2d 1068 (1996). The erroneous testimony regarding Fletcher’s statements was merely cumulative to testimony already presented by Dr. Ohr, Officer Marzullo and, most notably, Appellant himself. On review of this record, we conclude that, in view of the particular facts and circumstances of this case, any error in the hearsay admission of Fletcher’s statements was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. We stress that we reach this conclusion based on the other overwhelming evidence of Appellant’s guilt, most notably Appellant’s own detailed videotaped confession, but also the testimony of the other witnesses, as well as the remaining relevant testimony of both Det./Sgts. Spotleson and Martin. Based on this record, the cumulative nature of the officers’ testimony was neither impactful nor prejudicial. Excising that testimony and considering the remaining evidence presented, the state proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Appellant was the shooter. We caution that it is the nature and amount of other relevant evidence that clearly impacts our review of this matter. Absent the overwhelming evidence of guilt present in this record, the testimonial hearsay evidence would most likely not be harmless. Based on the record in this matter, Appellant’s first assignment of error is without merit and is overruled.\"\n}\n```"}

Appellant claims the testimony of two witnesses give rise to Confrontation Clause issues: the direct testimony of Det./Sgt. Spotleson and the direct testimony of Det./Sgt. Martin. Det./Sgt. Spotleson was lead investigator on the case and was assisted by Det./Sgt. Martin. Both were present during the interviews of Appellant and Fletcher. Det./Sgt. Spotleson provided most of the testimony to which Appellant objects. As noted above, during direct examination Det./Sgt. Spotleson was asked a number of questions regarding statements Fletcher made during her two interviews with police. At the outset it should be noted that, although the first interview was conducted on the same day as the incident, albeit several hours later, and the second interview was conducted the following morning, neither interview can be characterized as addressing an emergency situation. Fletcher was a person of interest during her first interview. At the conclusion of Fletcher’s first interview, Appellant was also a person of interest. At the time of the second interview, both Fletcher and Appellant had been placed under arrest. In the absence of an ongoing emergency, the statements made by Fletcher to police were made under circumstances that objectively indicate there was 'no such ongoing emergency, and that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.' Siler at ¶ 24, quoting Davis, at 822. The state contends the testimony of the detectives was 'offered to explain an officer’s conduct while investigating a crime' and thus, are not hearsay and do not violate the Confrontation Clause. We do not find this reasoning persuasive, particularly when considering the testimony elicited from Det./Sgt. Spotleson regarding his first interview of Fletcher: Q And you interviewed [Fletcher]? A Yes Q Did she tell you that she was present when this occurred? A Yes Q Did she identify a second person of interest? A Yes Q And who was that? A Michael Paige (1/3/17 Tr., p. 312.) In Ricks, the Ohio Supreme Court held that an officer’s testimony regarding the out-of-court statements of an alleged accomplice identifying the defendant as the assailant violated the Confrontation Clause when the accomplice did not testify at trial. In contrast, in Johnson, the investigating officer interviewed a witness named Wright. Wright invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege at the defendant’s trial. During defendant’s trial, the officer testified that Wright had given her a description of both the vehicle involved in the shooting and the shooter. During this testimony the officer did not repeat those descriptions. The Eighth District held that since the officer did not testify as to the exact statements of Wright, there was no Confrontation Clause violation. The state also presented the testimony of the decedent’s mother, Andrea, who had spoken to Wright about her son’s death: [STATE]: Why don’t you tell us about the following day. Did you meet with [Wright]? [ANDREA]: Yeah, the following day I guess he wanted to tell me who— [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Objection. THE COURT: Well, why don’t we caution [Andrea]. One of the rules in court is that you can’t tell us what somebody else said. [STATE]: We went over the rules a little bit before your testimony *** about hearsay. You can’t talk about what someone else told you, right? So I don’t want you to say the words that [Wright] said, right? [ANDREA]: Right [STATE]: Did [Wright] tell you what happened? [ANDREA]: Yes. [STATE]: And without telling us what he said, did he tell you who had done it? [ANDREA]: Yes. [STATE]: Did he give you one name or more than one? [ANDREA]: He gave me [the] first and last name *** of one person. [STATE]: Again, [Andrea], I don’t want to go into specifics about what he said, but did he tell you how it happened and how [Ayers] died? [ANDREA]: Yes. Johnson at ¶ 40. The Eighth District likewise held in regard to this testimony that since the actual information the witness had learned from Wright was not disclosed during testimony, the testimony was not offered to prove the circumstances of the decedent’s death but only to explain how the case unfolded. Hence, it was not testimonial hearsay. Id. at ¶ 41. The line of questioning in the instant case more closely reflects the situation found in Ricks, and not Johnson, as Appellee claims. Rather than testifying only to Det./Sgt. Spotleson’s 'conduct while investigating a crime,' the testimony goes further, eliciting testimony about the identification of Appellant by his codefendant. Blevins at 149. When testifying as to Fletcher's first interview, not only did Det./Sgt. Spotleson relate the questions he asked her, he testified that she gave the officer Appellant's name as a person involved in the crime. Regarding Fletcher's second interview, after she was shown the video of Appellant's interview implicating her as the shooter, Det./Sgt. Spotleson testified that Fletcher told him where she was standing, where the victim was standing and where the shooter was standing. He repeated those exact locations. He also testified that Fletcher told him Blake did not have a gun and that she did not feel threatened by Blake during the incident. (1/3/17 Tr., pp. 320-321, 329.) At the end of his questioning, Det./Sgt. Spotleson was asked whether he had a suspect at the conclusion of Fletcher's interview. He responded in the affirmative and named Appellant. This testimony goes beyond the process used in the investigation. It goes to the heart of the fact at issue, the name of the shooter. Although not as direct as the testimony revealed as a result of the first interview, and framed in a manner that appears to explain police conduct during an investigation, it is clear that Det./Sgt. Spotleson’s testimony was offered to place before the jury Fletcher's statements implicating Appellant as the shooter, and not simply to demonstrate how the investigation was conducted. Det./Sgt. Martin testified as a witness for Appellant. He was called to testify regarding the search of Appellant's residence, which failed to elicit an actual weapon, as well as to Appellant's gun powder residue test results, which were negative. On cross-examination, the state asked Det./Sgt. Martin about Appellant’s admission that he shot Blake and whether Appellant’s admission mirrored what Fletcher said about the crime scene: Q He also told you that he killed Munir Blake, correct? A Correct. Q And did [Fletcher] corroborate that? A Yes. Q He told you that [Blake] was standing that doorway—and just so you know, the jury went to the scene, so they have seen that. The doorway going from the kitchen onto that landing, stairway landing, he also told you that [Blake] was standing in that doorway, correct? A Correct. Q And did [Fletcher] corroborate that? A Yes. Q He also told you that [Fletcher] would have been pretty much facing [Blake], correct? A Correct. Q Standing on that landing, basically pretty much straight across from each other? A He described face to face. Q Okay. And [Fletcher] also corroborated that, correct? A Correct. *** Q To the best of your knowledge, did [Fletcher] ever say that she shot and killed [Blake]? A No. (1/3/17 Tr., pp. 418-419.) Again, rather than testifying only to Det./Sgt. Martin’s 'conduct while investigating a crime' the testimony goes further and seeks to place before the jury that Fletcher corroborated Appellant’s admission. Blevins at 149. As Fletcher did not testify, the state used the officer’s testimony to put Fletcher’s statements into evidence. Under the primary purpose test set forth in Crawford and its progeny, the statements made by Fletcher during her police interrogations are testimonial in nature. The testimony given by both officers goes beyond their investigatory conduct and procedure and instead appears to be an attempt to prove the truth of the matter asserted: to identify Appellant as the assailant and to bolster Appellant’s admission. As Fletcher did not testify at trial and there was no previous opportunity for Appellant to cross-examination Fletcher, this testimony was inadmissible hearsay in violation of the Confrontation Clause. Once we determine that the testimony was admitted erroneously, our inquiry does not end here, however. We must next look at whether Appellant was harmed by this error. In Ricks, the Supreme Court held that statements made by the officer were unfairly prejudicial and the cited purpose for the testimony, police investigatory procedure, was pretextual. Ricks at ¶ 34, 45. The Ricks Court found the out-of-court statements 'exceptionally damaging' because the declarant was the other suspect in the murder. As most of the state’s evidence related to the other suspect’s involvement in the crime, the state’s case, then,'revolved' around the declarant. Id. at ¶ 36. The Ricks Court concluded the Confrontation Clause violation was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt as there existed a reasonable possibility that the testimony of the officer contributed to the defendant’s conviction. Id. at ¶ 47. Whether a Confrontation Clause violation is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt involves not merely an inquiry into the sufficiency of the remaining evidence, absent the erroneously admitted evidence, but whether there is a reasonable possibility that the violating evidence might have contributed to the resulting conviction. Id. at ¶ 46, citing Chapman v. California, 368 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967). Regarding harmless error, Crim.R. 52(A) provides that 'any error, defect, irregularity, or variance which does not affect substantial rights shall be disregarded.' See also Evid.R. 103(A) (error may not be predicated on a ruling which admits or excludes evidence unless a substantial right of the party is affected and a timely objection was made.) In order to determine whether substantial rights were affected, we must evaluate whether there was prejudice to the defendant. State v. Morris, 141 Ohio St.3d 399, 2014-Ohio-5052, 24 N.E.3d 1153, ¶ 23, 27. A court is required to review the impact of the offending evidence on the overall verdict and compare it to the strength of the other remaining evidence. Id. at ¶ 25. To determine 'whether a new trial is required or the error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, the court must excise the improper evidence from the record and then look to the remaining evidence.' Morris at ¶ 29. Moreover, 'the cases where imposition of harmless error is appropriate must involve either overwhelming evidence of guilt or some other indicia that the error did not contribute to the conviction.' State v. Rahman, 23 Ohio St.3d 146, 151, 492 N.E.2d 401 (1986), quoting State v. Ferguson, 5 Ohio St.3d 160, 166, 450 N.E.2d 265 (1983), fn. 5. The fact that most concerned the Ricks Court was that the declarant who was the subject of the officer's testimony was an accomplice, and the state's evidence centered predominately around the accomplice. In the instant case, Fletcher is also a codefendant. The same concern over utilizing the testimonial statements of a codefendant is theoretically applicable here. Both investigating detectives testified about statements made by Fletcher which placed Appellant at the scene as the shooter. In urging prejudice under the plain error standard, Appellant alleges that although he confessed to shooting Blake, the record reflects that he told several different accounts of the events that transpired. The testimony of Det./Sgts. Spotleson and Martin had the effect of bolstering his admission, by corroborating the details of the version of events (including Appellant's own) that reflect Appellant's guilt. While we are troubled by the admission of the testimony of Det./Sgts. Spotleson and Martin because the testimony went beyond what is allowable by law, the troubling nature of the testimony is considerably lessened when considering the remaining evidence presented to the jury. Excising the testimony of Det./Sgts. Spotleson and Martin, which we are required to do, this record reveals that the jury had before it overwhelming evidence of Appellant's guilt. First and foremost, the jury was shown the videotaped admission of the shooting by Appellant, where he provided a detailed description of the murder scene and of the events in his own words. His description of the incident was corroborated by the testimony of Officer Anthony Marzullo who investigated the scene. It was further corroborated by Dr. Ohr, the medical examiner who not only investigated at the scene but performed the autopsy on Blake. Further, the jury was taken to the scene of the shooting in order to better visualize the testimony presented regarding the placement of the shooter in relation to the gunshot wounds suffered by Blake. We cannot discount the inherent significance of the video confession, where the jury was able to see Appellant confessing to the crime and describing the scene in detail. Nor can we second-guess the jury’s credibility determinations in that regard. State v. Hill, 75 Ohio St.3d 195, 205, 661 N.E.2d 1068 (1996). The erroneous testimony regarding Fletcher’s statements was merely cumulative to testimony already presented by Dr. Ohr, Officer Marzullo and, most notably, Appellant himself. On review of this record, we conclude that, in view of the particular facts and circumstances of this case, any error in the hearsay admission of Fletcher’s statements was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. We stress that we reach this conclusion based on the other overwhelming evidence of Appellant’s guilt, most notably Appellant’s own detailed videotaped confession, but also the testimony of the other witnesses, as well as the remaining relevant testimony of both Det./Sgts. Spotleson and Martin. Based on this record, the cumulative nature of the officers’ testimony was neither impactful nor prejudicial. Excising that testimony and considering the remaining evidence presented, the state proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Appellant was the shooter. We caution that it is the nature and amount of other relevant evidence that clearly impacts our review of this matter. Absent the overwhelming evidence of guilt present in this record, the testimonial hearsay evidence would most likely not be harmless. Based on the record in this matter, Appellant’s first assignment of error is without merit and is overruled.\"\n}\n```"}

Spotleson and Martin was for the purpose of explaining their conduct during the investigatory process and that the probative value of the evidence was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. The trial court typically has broad discretion in admitting or excluding evidence. However, a de novo standard of review is applied to a claim that a criminal defendant's rights have been violated under the Confrontation Clause. Pursuant to the Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause, 'in all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right * * * to be confronted with the witnesses against him.' Testimonial statements of a non-testifying witness are inadmissible unless the witness was unavailable to testify and the defendant had a prior opportunity for cross-examination of the witness. In Crawford, the Supreme Court declined to provide a comprehensive definition of 'testimonial,' but indicated that the term includes, at a minimum, prior testimony at a preliminary hearing, before a grand jury, at a former trial, and statements made during police interrogations. In Davis, the Supreme Court held that statements are nontestimonial for Confrontation Clause purposes when made in the course of a police interrogation under such circumstances that indicate objectively the primary purpose of the interrogation is to enable police to address an ongoing emergency. Testimonial statements occur when the circumstances objectively indicate that there is no ongoing emergency and the primary purpose of the interrogation is to establish or prove past events that are potentially relevant to a future criminal prosecution.

During defendant’s trial, the officer testified that Wright had given her a description of both the vehicle involved in the shooting and the shooter. During this testimony the officer did not repeat those descriptions. The Eighth District held that since the officer did not testify as to the exact statements of Wright, there was no Confrontation Clause violation. The state also presented the testimony of the decedent’s mother, Andrea, who had spoken to Wright about her son’s death: [STATE]: Why don’t you tell us about the following day. Did you meet with [Wright]? [ANDREA]: Yeah, the following day I guess he wanted to tell me who— [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Objection. THE COURT: Well, why don’t we caution [Andrea]. One of the rules in court is that you can’t tell us what somebody else said. [STATE]: We went over the rules a little bit before your testimony *** about hearsay. You can’t talk about what someone else told you, right? So I don’t want you to say the words that [Wright] said, right? [ANDREA]: Right [STATE]: Did [Wright] tell you what happened? [ANDREA]: Yes. [STATE]: And without telling us what he said, did he tell you who had done it? [ANDREA]: Yes. [STATE]: Did he give you one name or more than one? [ANDREA]: He gave me [the] first and last name *** of one person. [STATE]: Again, [Andrea], I don’t want to go into specifics about what he said, but did he tell you how it happened and how [Ayers] died? [ANDREA]: Yes. Johnson at ¶ 40. The Eighth District likewise held in regard to this testimony that since the actual information the witness had learned from Wright was not disclosed during testimony, the testimony was not offered to prove the circumstances of the decedent’s death but only to explain how the case unfolded. Hence, it was not testimonial hearsay. Id. at ¶ 41. The line of questioning in the instant case more closely reflects the situation found in Ricks, and not Johnson, as Appellee claims. Rather than testifying only to Det./Sgt. Spotleson’s 'conduct while investigating a crime,' the testimony goes further, eliciting testimony about the identification of Appellant by his codefendant. Blevins at 149. When testifying as to Fletcher's first interview, not only did Det./Sgt. Spotleson relate the questions he asked her, he testified that she gave the officer Appellant's name as a person involved in the crime. Regarding Fletcher's second interview, after she was shown the video of Appellant's interview implicating her as the shooter, Det./Sgt. Spotleson testified that Fletcher told him where she was standing, where the victim was standing and where the shooter was standing. He repeated those exact locations. He also testified that Fletcher told him Blake did not have a gun and that she did not feel threatened by Blake during the incident. (1/3/17 Tr., pp. 320-321, 329.) At the end of his questioning, Det./Sgt. Spotleson was asked whether he had a suspect at the conclusion of Fletcher's interview. He responded in the affirmative and named Appellant. This testimony goes beyond the process used in the investigation. It goes to the heart of the fact at issue, the name of the shooter. Although not as direct as the testimony revealed as a result of the first interview, and framed in a manner that appears to explain police conduct during an investigation, it is clear that Det./Sgt. Spotleson’s testimony was offered to place before the jury Fletcher's statements implicating Appellant as the shooter, and not simply to demonstrate how the investigation was conducted. Det./Sgt. Martin testified as a witness for Appellant. He was called to testify regarding the search of Appellant's residence, which failed to elicit an actual weapon, as well as to Appellant's gun powder residue test results, which were negative. On cross-examination, the state asked Det./Sgt. Martin about Appellant’s admission that he shot Blake and whether Appellant’s admission mirrored what Fletcher said about the crime scene: Q He also told you that he killed Munir Blake, correct? A Correct. Q And did [Fletcher] corroborate that? A Yes. Q He told you that [Blake] was standing that doorway—and just so you know, the jury went to the scene, so they have seen that. The doorway going from the kitchen onto that landing, stairway landing, he also told you that [Blake] was standing in that doorway, correct? A Correct. Q And did [Fletcher] corroborate that? A Yes. Q He also told you that [Fletcher] would have been pretty much facing [Blake], correct? A Correct. Q Standing on that landing, basically pretty much straight across from each other? A He described face to face. Q Okay. And [Fletcher] also corroborated that, correct? A Correct. *** Q To the best of your knowledge, did [Fletcher] ever say that she shot and killed [Blake]? A No. (1/3/17 Tr., pp. 418-419.) Again, rather than testifying only to Det./Sgt. Martin’s 'conduct while investigating a crime' the testimony goes further and seeks to place before the jury that Fletcher corroborated Appellant’s admission. Blevins at 149. As Fletcher did not testify, the state used the officer’s testimony to put Fletcher’s statements into evidence. Under the primary purpose test set forth in Crawford and its progeny, the statements made by Fletcher during her police interrogations are testimonial in nature. The testimony given by both officers goes beyond their investigatory conduct and procedure and instead appears to be an attempt to prove the truth of the matter asserted: to identify Appellant as the assailant and to bolster Appellant’s admission. As Fletcher did not testify at trial and there was no previous opportunity for Appellant to cross-examination Fletcher, this testimony was inadmissible hearsay in violation of the Confrontation Clause. Once we determine that the testimony was admitted erroneously, our inquiry does not end here, however. We must next look at whether Appellant was harmed by this error. In Ricks, the Supreme Court held that statements made by the officer were unfairly prejudicial and the cited purpose for the testimony, police investigatory procedure, was pretextual. Ricks at ¶ 34, 45. The Ricks Court found the out-of-court statements 'exceptionally damaging' because the declarant was the other suspect in the murder. As most of the state’s evidence related to the other suspect’s involvement in the crime, the state’s case, then,'revolved' around the declarant. Id. at ¶ 36. The Ricks Court concluded the Confrontation Clause violation was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt as there existed a reasonable possibility that the testimony of the officer contributed to the defendant’s conviction. Id. at ¶ 47. Whether a Confrontation Clause violation is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt involves not merely an inquiry into the sufficiency of the remaining evidence, absent the erroneously admitted evidence, but whether there is a reasonable possibility that the violating evidence might have contributed to the resulting conviction. Id. at ¶ 46, citing Chapman v. California, 368 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967). Regarding harmless error, Crim.R. 52(A) provides that 'any error, defect, irregularity, or variance which does not affect substantial rights shall be disregarded.' See also Evid.R. 103(A) (error may not be predicated on a ruling which admits or excludes evidence unless a substantial right of the party is affected and a timely objection was made.) In order to determine whether substantial rights were affected, we must evaluate whether there was prejudice to the defendant. State v. Morris, 141 Ohio St.3d 399, 2014-Ohio-5052, 24 N.E.3d 1153, ¶ 23, 27. A court is required to review the impact of the offending evidence on the overall verdict and compare it to the strength of the other remaining evidence. Id. at ¶ 25. To determine 'whether a new trial is required or the error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, the court must excise the improper evidence from the record and then look to the remaining evidence.' Morris at ¶ 29. Moreover, 'the cases where imposition of harmless error is appropriate must involve either overwhelming evidence of guilt or some other indicia that the error did not contribute to the conviction.' State v. Rahman, 23 Ohio St.3d 146, 151, 492 N.E.2d 401 (1986), quoting State v. Ferguson, 5 Ohio St.3d 160, 166, 450 N.E.2d 265 (1983), fn. 5. The fact that most concerned the Ricks Court was that the declarant who was the subject of the officer's testimony was an accomplice, and the state's evidence centered predominately around the accomplice. In the instant case, Fletcher is also a codefendant. The same concern over utilizing the testimonial statements of a codefendant is theoretically applicable here. Both investigating detectives testified about statements made by Fletcher which placed Appellant at the scene as the shooter. In urging prejudice under the plain error standard, Appellant alleges that although he confessed to shooting Blake, the record reflects that he told several different accounts of the events that transpired. The testimony of Det./Sgts. Spotleson and Martin had the effect of bolstering his admission, by corroborating the details of the version of events (including Appellant's own) that reflect Appellant's guilt. While we are troubled by the admission of the testimony of Det./Sgts. Spotleson and Martin because the testimony went beyond what is allowable by law, the troubling nature of the testimony is considerably lessened when considering the remaining evidence presented to the jury. Excising the testimony of Det./Sgts. Spotleson and Martin, which we are required to do, this record reveals that the jury had before it overwhelming evidence of Appellant's guilt. First and foremost, the jury was shown the videotaped admission of the shooting by Appellant, where he provided a detailed description of the murder scene and of the events in his own words. His description of the incident was corroborated by the testimony of Officer Anthony Marzullo who investigated the scene. It was further corroborated by Dr. Ohr, the medical examiner who not only investigated at the scene but performed the autopsy on Blake. Further, the jury was taken to the scene of the shooting in order to better visualize the testimony presented regarding the placement of the shooter in relation to the gunshot wounds suffered by Blake. We cannot discount the inherent significance of the video confession, where the jury was able to see Appellant confessing to the crime and describing the scene in detail. Nor can we second-guess the jury’s credibility determinations in that regard. State v. Hill, 75 Ohio St.3d 195, 205, 661 N.E.2d 1068 (1996). The erroneous testimony regarding Fletcher’s statements was merely cumulative to testimony already presented by Dr. Ohr, Officer Marzullo and, most notably, Appellant himself. On review of this record, we conclude that, in view of the particular facts and circumstances of this case, any error in the hearsay admission of Fletcher’s statements was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. We stress that we reach this conclusion based on the other overwhelming evidence of Appellant’s guilt, most notably Appellant’s own detailed videotaped confession, but also the testimony of the other witnesses, as well as the remaining relevant testimony of both Det./Sgts. Spotleson and Martin. Based on this record, the cumulative nature of the officers’ testimony was neither impactful nor prejudicial. Excising that testimony and considering the remaining evidence presented, the state proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Appellant was the shooter. We caution that it is the nature and amount of other relevant evidence that clearly impacts our review of this matter. Absent the overwhelming evidence of guilt present in this record, the testimonial hearsay evidence would most likely not be harmless. Based on the record in this matter, Appellant’s first assignment of error is without merit and is overruled.\"\n}\n```"}

Spotleson and Martin regarding the statements Fletcher made to them during police interviews constituted testimonial hearsay in violation of his right to confront witnesses guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause. The state contends the testimony of Det./Sgts. Spotleson and Martin was for the purpose of explaining their conduct during the investigatory process and that the probative value of the evidence was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. The trial court typically has broad discretion in admitting or excluding evidence. However, a de novo standard of review is applied to a claim that a criminal defendant's rights have been violated under the Confrontation Clause. Pursuant to the Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause, 'in all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right * * * to be confronted with the witnesses against him.' Testimonial statements of a non-testifying witness are inadmissible unless the witness was unavailable to testify and the defendant had a prior opportunity for cross-examination of the witness. In Crawford, the Supreme Court declined to provide a comprehensive definition of 'testimonial,' but indicated that the term includes, at a minimum, prior testimony at a preliminary hearing, before a grand jury, at a former trial, and statements made during police interrogations. In Davis, the Supreme Court held that statements are nontestimonial for Confrontation Clause purposes when made in the course of a police interrogation under such circumstances that indicate objectively the primary purpose of the interrogation is to enable police to address an ongoing emergency. Testimonial statements occur when the circumstances objectively indicate that there is no ongoing emergency and the primary purpose of the interrogation is to establish or prove past events that are potentially relevant to a future criminal prosecution. Hence, we must distinguish between police interrogations that are part of an ongoing emergency and interrogations related to past criminal conduct and which serve only to investigate potential criminal prosecution. Appellant claims the testimony of two witnesses give rise to Confrontation Clause issues: the direct testimony of Det./Sgt. Spotleson and the direct testimony of Det./Sgt. Martin. Det./Sgt. Spotleson was lead investigator on the case and was assisted by Det./Sgt. Martin. Both were present during the interviews of Appellant and Fletcher. Det./Sgt. Spotleson provided most of the testimony to which Appellant objects. As noted above, during direct examination Det./Sgt. Spotleson was asked a number of questions regarding statements Fletcher made during her two interviews with police. At the outset it should be noted that, although the first interview was conducted on the same day as the incident, albeit several hours later, and the second interview was conducted the following morning, neither interview can be characterized as addressing an emergency situation. Fletcher was a person of interest during her first interview. At the conclusion of Fletcher’s first interview, Appellant was also a person of interest. At the time of the second interview, both Fletcher and Appellant had been placed under arrest. In the absence of an ongoing emergency, the statements made by Fletcher to police were made under circumstances that objectively indicate there was 'no such ongoing emergency, and that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.' Siler at ¶ 24, quoting Davis, at 822. The state contends the testimony of the detectives was 'offered to explain an officer’s conduct while investigating a crime' and thus, are not hearsay and do not violate the Confrontation Clause. We do not find this reasoning persuasive, particularly when considering the testimony elicited from Det./Sgt. Spotleson regarding his first interview of Fletcher: Q And you interviewed [Fletcher]? A Yes Q Did she tell you that she was present when this occurred? A Yes Q Did she identify a second person of interest? A Yes Q And who was that? A Michael Paige (1/3/17 Tr., p. 312.)

Burton points to multiple discrepancies in the trial evidence and testimony to support his assertion that the ECPD planted evidence illegally secured from Burton’s vehicle in the third-floor unit and that Burton was the target of the investigation from the start. Burton reiterates that residents testified they did not hear gunshots at the property, and they told police that Burton collected rent at the property, performed maintenance and repair services, but that he did not reside there. The shooting victim identified Burton from the single cellphone photograph displayed to him at the hospital by ECPD Officer Nevels. Burton was arrested at the scene and said that he ‘was booked in with all of the property that I had and the only key I had was a Chevy Cruze key’ to his car that was parked in the lot next door to the house. (Tr. 391.) Burton argues that the police used the key to illegally search the Chevy and place the contents in the third-floor unit. Officer Nevels testified that Officer Kaleal inventoried the Chevy. Thus, Burton offers that the New Tow Evidence confirms that the ECPD towed the vehicle the night of the incident and the Trial Tow Evidence falsely indicated that Burton’s vehicle was not towed until August 25, 2017. Detective Harvey responded to the scene at 3:00 a.m. and secured a search warrant. Guns, drugs, and related contraband were located in the third-floor unit. Also discovered were various pieces of mail and miscellaneous papers and receipts, a Chase debit card with an expiration date of September 2017, and a pill bottle with Burton’s name. Based on the latter evidence, Detective Harvey determined that Burton was the third-floor resident. Burton testified in his defense that he was staying ‘between two places’ at the time of the incident. (Tr. 376.) Burton resided on Kildare Road in Cleveland Heights and frequently stayed on Clarkstone Road in East Cleveland with Deanna Thomas, the mother of his recently born child and the owner of the property. Burton arrived at the property about 11:15 p.m. the night of the incident to repair a plumbing leak and returned to the property shortly after midnight with a rent receipt book to collect a rent payment from tenant D.S. who worked until midnight. Burton knocked on D.S.’s door who did not answer. Burton walked back outside as D.S. pulled into the driveway and police walked through the perimeter bushes into the yard. The police asked Burton and D.S. whether they resided at the property and for identification. A bodycam video was played for the jury and Burton can be heard telling the police that he owned the house and he had the keys so that police could not enter the house. Burton added that, contrary to Officer Nevels’s testimony, Officer Nevels was at the scene. When Burton was booked, the police ‘already had my address on file. It’s on the police report. It says 3425 Kildare.’ (Tr. 390.) Burton observed Officer Kaleal entered his vehicle at the scene and took out a set of keys that were for Ms. Thomas’s house on Clarkstone. Burton denied that he had keys to the property though Officer Kaleal testified that Burton used a key to lock the third-floor unit door to prevent entry. Burton said the mail, papers, pill bottle, and bank card were in his Chevy. ‘They even have the booklet from the car stuffed inside those papers.’ (Tr. 392.) Burton offered that the pills were old and must have been in the car as well. ‘I know for a fact the bank card was in my glove compartment. It’s an old bank card. I think that Chase account closed back in 2015. I opened it in 2014.’ (Tr. 393.) Further regarding the mail evidence: Burton: I know for a fact that mail wasn’t up there because it had — it was mail in there from old tenants and I know for a fact that the mail from the old tenants, I was going by my house mixing that mail up with my water bills and stuff like that. And it wasn’t mail from Deanna Thomas. So if all of that mail was together, it was in my car. State: It was not upstairs? Burton: No. State: And you know that because the police report talks about your car being towed and inventoried? Burton: Yeah. But that’s what I couldn’t understand. I never seen the inventory slip for the vehicle. State: Right. Burton: The things that were found. State: Isn’t it possible because your car was never inventoried, sir? Burton: No. That’s not possible because she said she got an inventory slip when she got the car out of the impound and Harvey— State: Who? Burton: Deanna Thomas. (Tr. 420-421.) Further pertinent to the tow, during recross-examination, the Trial Tow Evidence, state exhibit Nos. 87 and 88, were referenced by Burton:5 State: Sir, you talked about how you own a Saturn Vue, right, that’s the car you had? Burton: I had a Saturn Vue and I had a Chevy Cruze. State: Okay. Which one was inventoried that night? Burton: The Chevy Cruze. State: Okay. And you said you had an inventory slip for it? Burton: It’s a tow slip. State: Where is that tow slip? Burton: Sitting on the defense table. * * * State: You handed me two pieces of paper, correct? Burton: Uh-huh. State: First one I marked here as State's Exhibit 88. What is that that you handed me? Burton: This is — it says 8/12/2017, 05:00 I guess. Is that correct? State: Yeah. It says 05:01:55 would be the time. Dispatcher 0992, 3169 arrived to the scene and is en route to secure a search warrant to search the property. At 7:22:11, 3118 and first shift are out at 2062 Noble. And then the next one is at 9:51:38 search warrant was served. And then at 9:58:22 St. Clair Auto is on scene. And it’s your testimony that St. Clair Auto was there to tow your vehicle? Burton: Uh-huh. State: And you handed me a receipt here, Number 87. Burton: Uh-huh. State: That’s a receipt for when your vehicle was towed? Burton: Uh-huh. State: What is the date towed on that receipt, sir? Burton: This is the date it was towed from East Cleveland city jail to St. Clair Auto Body. State: How do you know that? Burton: What do you mean how I know? State: Here. St. Clair is on scene. St. Clair Auto Body says it was date towed 8/25/17, correct? Burton: Yes. State: Not 8/12, correct? Burton: Uh-huh. (Tr. 434-435.) The state reiterated and Burton confirmed that the tow date listed on the Trial Tow Evidence slip was August 25, 2017, and not the incident date of August 12, 2017.\"\n}\n```"}

Johnston*, 39 Ohio St.3d 48, 60, 529 N.E.2d 898 (1988). *Brady* violations may be found regardless of whether the defense requested the evidence and ‘irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.’ *Brady*, 373 U.S. 83, at 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). Burton points to multiple discrepancies in the trial evidence and testimony to support his assertion that the ECPD planted evidence illegally secured from Burton’s vehicle in the third-floor unit and that Burton was the target of the investigation from the start. Burton reiterates that residents testified they did not hear gunshots at the property, and they told police that Burton collected rent at the property, performed maintenance and repair services, but that he did not reside there. The shooting victim identified Burton from the single cellphone photograph displayed to him at the hospital by ECPD Officer Nevels. Burton was arrested at the scene and said that he ‘was booked in with all of the property that I had and the only key I had was a Chevy Cruze key’ to his car that was parked in the lot next door to the house. (Tr. 391.) Burton argues that the police used the key to illegally search the Chevy and place the contents in the third-floor unit. Officer Nevels testified that Officer Kaleal inventoried the Chevy. Thus, Burton offers that the New Tow Evidence confirms that the ECPD towed the vehicle the night of the incident and the Trial Tow Evidence falsely indicated that Burton’s vehicle was not towed until August 25, 2017. Detective Harvey responded to the scene at 3:00 a.m. and secured a search warrant. Guns, drugs, and related contraband were located in the third-floor unit. Also discovered were various pieces of mail and miscellaneous papers and receipts, a Chase debit card with an expiration date of September 2017, and a pill bottle with Burton’s name. Based on the latter evidence, Detective Harvey determined that Burton was the third-floor resident. Burton testified in his defense that he was staying ‘between two places’ at the time of the incident. (Tr. 376.) Burton resided on Kildare Road in Cleveland Heights and frequently stayed on Clarkstone Road in East Cleveland with Deanna Thomas, the mother of his recently born child and the owner of the property. Burton arrived at the property about 11:15 p.m. the night of the incident to repair a plumbing leak and returned to the property shortly after midnight with a rent receipt book to collect a rent payment from tenant D.S. who worked until midnight. Burton knocked on D.S.’s door who did not answer. Burton walked back outside as D.S. pulled into the driveway and police walked through the perimeter bushes into the yard. The police asked Burton and D.S. whether they resided at the property and for identification. A bodycam video was played for the jury and Burton can be heard telling the police that he owned the house and he had the keys so that police could not enter the house. Burton added that, contrary to Officer Nevels’s testimony, Officer Nevels was at the scene. When Burton was booked, the police ‘already had my address on file. It’s on the police report. It says 3425 Kildare.’ (Tr. 390.) Burton observed Officer Kaleal entered his vehicle at the scene and took out a set of keys that were for Ms. Thomas’s house on Clarkstone. Burton denied that he had keys to the property though Officer Kaleal testified that Burton used a key to lock the third-floor unit door to prevent entry. Burton said the mail, papers, pill bottle, and bank card were in his Chevy. ‘They even have the booklet from the car stuffed inside those papers.’ (Tr. 392.) Burton offered that the pills were old and must have been in the car as well. ‘I know for a fact the bank card was in my glove compartment. It’s an old bank card. I think that Chase account closed back in 2015. I opened it in 2014.’ (Tr. 393.)

The portion of the felonious assault statute he was found guilty of violating states: (A) No person shall knowingly do either of the following: (1) Cause serious physical harm to another or to another's unborn; (D)(1)(a) Whoever violates this section is guilty of felonious assault. Except as otherwise provided in this division or division (D)(1)(b) of this section, felonious assault is a felony of the second degree. R.C. 2903.11(A)(1)(D). Appellant was found guilty of second-degree felony child endangering defined as: (B) No person shall do any of the following to a child under eighteen years of age or a mentally or physically handicapped child under twenty-one years of age: *** (3) Administer corporal punishment or other physical disciplinary measure, or physically restrain the child in a cruel manner or for a prolonged period, which punishment, discipline, or restraint is excessive under the circumstances and creates a substantial risk of serious physical harm to the child; *** (E)(1) Whoever violates this section is guilty of endangering children. *** (3) If the offender violates division (B)(2), (3), (4), or (6) of this section, except as otherwise provided in this division, endangering children is a felony of the third degree. If the violation results in serious physical harm to the child involved, or if the offender previously has been convicted of an offense under this section or of any offense involving neglect, abandonment, contributing to the delinquency of, or physical abuse of a child, endangering children is a felony of the second degree. R.C. 2919.22(B)(3)(E)(1)(3). Appellant was found to have caused serious physical harm under this statute. Appellant was also found guilty of third-degree felony child endangering as defined as: (A) No person, who is the parent, guardian, custodian, person having custody or control, or person in loco parentis of a child under eighteen years of age or a mentally or physically handicapped child under twenty-one years of age, shall create a substantial risk to the health or safety of the child, by violating a duty of care, protection, or support. It is not a violation of a duty of care, protection, or support under this division when the parent, guardian, custodian, or person having custody or control of a child treats the physical or mental illness or defect of the child by spiritual means through prayer alone, in accordance with the tenets of a recognized religious body. *** (E)(1) Whoever violates this section is guilty of endangering children.

R.C. 2919.22(A)(E)(1)(2)(c). The felonious assault and both child endangering crimes have a common element – to have caused serious physical harm. Second degree felony child endangering also requires a substantial risk of serious physical harm and excessive corporal punishment. These are the elements Appellant focuses on in this assignment of error. He asserts the paddling was not excessive. He contends there was no evidence that paddling a fully clothed child created a substantial risk of serious physical harm. He also argues the abrasion on the victim's buttocks does not amount to serious physical harm. The analysis begins with whether there was sufficient evidence produced by the state to show the administration of corporal punishment was excessive under the circumstances. This is an element of the second-degree felony child endangering crime. It is undisputed in this case that the injury was caused by the administering of a paddle board on the victim's clothed buttocks. The victim confirmed this admission. We have previously stated that in corporal discipline cases, the state must prove the corporal discipline was improper in light of all of the surrounding facts and circumstances. State v. Rosa, 7th Dist. No. 12 MA 60, 2013-Ohio-5867, 6 N.E.3d 57, ¶ 41. The factors to be considered are: (1) the child's age; (2) the child's behavior leading up to the discipline; (3) the child's response to prior non-corporal punishment; (4) the location and severity of the punishment; and (5) the parent's state of mind while administering the punishment. Id., quoting State v. Luke, 3d Dist. No. 14-10-26, 2011-Ohio-4330, ¶ 23; State v. Hart, 110 Ohio App.3d 250, 255–56, 673 N.E.2d 992 (3d Dist.1996) (“The propriety and reasonableness of corporal punishment in each case must be judged in light of the totality of the circumstances.”). In the case at hand, the victim was 11 years old. The victim was not correctly completing a math problem and this led to the paddling; Appellant admitted the victim was not a behavioral problem. Trial Tr. 322, 324. Appellant testified he used fear and discipline to get his students to focus. Trial Tr. 320. Appellant testified he gave the victim the opportunity to get the math problems correct, but the victim would not carry the digit correctly and kept getting the problems wrong. Trial Tr. 325. Testimony indicated Appellant yelled and scared his students prior to paddling them. Trial Tr. 284; 320. It is undisputed the victim was paddled on his clothed buttocks five times during one tutoring session. Trial Tr. 326. The victim’s aunt, who was the first person the victim showed the injury, described it as follows: It was – his skin was reddish and purplish and it had a scab. You could see like the where the pores of his skin was so open that they were bleeding, you know, it was bleeding out, and it was like holes. You could actually see holes in it. And I asked him, I said, does it hurt? He said, yes, it hurts to sit and everything. So I put gauze, and I put Neosporin on it, and I bandaged it up and tried to cushion it as much as possible. But I had to – I sent a text to his mom and showed her the picture. Trial Tr. 216. Dr. John Melville from the CAC testified at trial. Trial Tr. 241-242. He saw the victim the day after the injury was shown to the aunt. He described the injury as a crescent shaped abrasion about 6cm by 1cm. Trial Tr. 255. It was dark red and there was evidence of some healing. Trial Tr. 255. At the two week follow up visit there was evidence of healing, but the injury was not gone. Trial Tr. 256-257. After one month of healing, the doctor testified there was further healing but the mark was still present. Trial Tr. 257. Pictures taken at the CAC were admitted into evidence. Trial Tr. 254; State’s Exhibit 2-5. Appellant testified he did not want to hurt the victim. Trial Tr. 328. He explained he taught in a fear induced learning environment. Trial Tr. 320. He stated it was “like an exorcism” to get the victim to carry the number correctly in doing a three digit math problem. Trial Tr. 325. Considering these facts in the light most favorable to the prosecution the punishment was improper and excessive. As to the felonious assault and third-degree felony child endangering convictions, the question is whether there was serious physical harm to the child. As there was sufficient evidence of excessive corporal punishment, the analysis for the second-degree felony child endangering conviction is whether there was a substantial risk of serious physical harm to the child. “Serious physical harm to persons” is defined as: (a) Any mental illness or condition of such gravity as would normally require hospitalization or prolonged psychiatric treatment; (b) Any physical harm that carries a substantial risk of death; (c) Any physical harm that involves some permanent incapacity, whether partial or total, or that involves some temporary, substantial incapacity; (d) Any physical harm that involves some permanent disfigurement or that involves some temporary, serious disfigurement; (e) Any physical harm that involves acute pain of such duration as to result in substantial suffering or that involves any degree of prolonged or intractable pain. R.C. 2901.01(A)(5). “Substantial risk” is defined as “a strong possibility, as contrasted with a remote or significant possibility, that a certain result may occur or that certain circumstances may exist.” R.C. 2901.01(A)(8). Appellant cites this court to a case where the appellate court found there was not sufficient evidence of serious physical harm or substantial risk of serious physical harm. He contends the cases cited by him are examples of worse conduct by an offender and the appellate court found there was not sufficient evidence of the crimes. Three of the cases - Ivey, Wright, and Enovitch - are from the Eighth Appellate District and are from the mid to late 1990s. In Ivey, the child had welts and bruises on his buttocks and legs from being beat with a belt for disciplinary reasons. State v. Ivey, 98 Ohio App.3d 249, 648 N.E.2d 519 (8th Dist.1994). In reversing the conviction, the Eighth Appellate District court stated: Although the punishment may have been excessive, the state produced no evidence that the bruises and welts caused by the strapping resulted in serious physical harm or created a substantial risk of serious physical harm. On the contrary, the evidence showed the boy went to school, without incident, the next day. There was no evidence he was in great pain or that he had trouble sitting or walking. The treating physician did not find it necessary to hospitalize the boy, order any type of pain killer (even aspirin), or to schedule another medical exam to check on his progress. The evidence presented in the record shows the injuries sustained by the child were the result of the imposition of corporal punishment by a father who judged his son's school conduct and acts of deception warranted a strong physical disciplinary response. The state failed to prove by sufficient evidence that this type of whipping resulted in serious physical harm or could result in a substantial risk of serious physical harm to the child. Id. at 524. Similarly in the other two Eighth Appellate District cases the court found there was not sufficient evidence of serious physical harm. City of Shaker Hts. v. Wright, 8th Dist. No. 69517, 1996 WL 355309 (June 27, 1996); State v. Enovitch, 8th Dist. No. 72827, 1998 WL 518163 (Aug. 20, 1998). Wright was a child endangering case and in that case the court explained: This conclusion, that the element of seriousness was lacking, is buttressed by the following: (1) the marks were small and were receding over time; (2) the emergency room physician testified that he thought that there was no scarring at the site of the marks and did not feel there had been any abuse; (3) the emergency room report identified the marks as bruises or contusions, not scars; (4) while the injury site was sore the evening it was inflicted, the injury did not prevent the boy from sleeping and the victim experienced no pain at the site of the injury the morning after the injury was inflicted and thereafter enjoyed his normal activities without pain or difficulty; (5) the injury required no follow-up medical care or physical therapy; and, (6) the treating physician did not hospitalize the boy. Accordingly, the City failed to prove by sufficient evidence that this type of whipping resulted in serious physical harm or could result in a substantial risk of serious physical harm to the child. Wright, 8th Dist. No. 69517. Enovitch was a felonious assault case and in that case the court explained: Other than Gartman's statement, there was no evidence at trial that the scar above his eye was permanent. There is no evidence as to who told him the scar would not go away or that the person was qualified to make such a determination. The hospital records described his injury as just over 1.5 centimeters in length and as a “burst-type injury, clean, shallow, not particularly jagged.” The hospital discharge instructions characterized the injury as “minor.” Based upon the evidence presented, we conclude that Gartman's injury did not constitute the serious physical harm required for a felonious assault conviction. Accordingly, Enovitch's second assignment of error is well taken. Enovitch, 8th Dist. No. 72827. Appellant also cites In re L.J., 176 Ohio App.3d 186, 2008-Ohio-1488, 891 N.E.2d 778 (3d Dist.). In that case, the appellate court found the trial court erred as a matter of law when it concluded the child was “abused” under R.C. 2151.031(C) because of corporal punishment. Id. at ¶ 45. The appellate court explained the evidence was insufficient to show the corporal punishment was excessive and to show that it created a substantial risk of serious physical harm: While we certainly share the trial court's sentiment that striking a child with a belt on back of the legs supports a finding that the punishment was excessive, this court has stated that corporal punishment on parts of the body other than the buttocks may be proper and reasonable. Hart, 110 Ohio App.3d at 255, 673 N.E.2d 992. In addition, Skinner testified that she had intended to strike J.L. on the butt; however, J.L. moved, which is why she missed. As to the severity, the marks were red but also appeared to be fading and healing within three to four days after the incident, which indicates that the discipline may not have been excessive. Skinner also testified that she did not observe bruises on J.L. after the incident. The record lacks any medical evidence, which would lead one to conclude that the discipline was excessive. No physician testified at the hearing, nor was any medical report admitted into evidence showing that J.L. required medical attention as a result of the discipline. In fact, on the day the caseworker discovered the bruises, J.L. was outside playing with his brother. * * * We also cannot conclude that the punishment created a substantial risk of serious physical harm as those terms are defined. The evidence presented consisted of Core’s testimony and the photographs, which, for the most part, revealed that J.L. was bruised. Our review of the admitted photographic evidence confirms that J.L. was bruised, but bruising alone is not sufficient to constitute serious physical harm. In re Schuerman, 74 Ohio App.3d at 532, 599 N.E.2d 728 (trial court could reasonably infer that severe bruising on the buttocks, thighs, and ankles from punishment that was inflicted multiple times for the same misbehavior with a wooden paddle or belt on an eight-year-old girl created a substantial risk of serious physical harm). Other courts have found that punishment much more severe than J.L.’s did not constitute serious physical harm. See, e.g., Ivey, 98 Ohio App.3d at 255–256, 648 N.E.2d 519 (bruised left eyelid, bruises, welts, and lacerations caused by a belt whipping on the buttocks and lower legs and a swollen hand was not “serious physical harm”). Again, notably missing from the record is any medical evidence or reports to show that J.L.’s injuries amounted to serious physical harm. On the basis of this record, we cannot conclude that the corporal punishment caused a substantial risk of serious physical harm. Id. at ¶ 41, 44. Appellant also cites a biting case where the parents used biting as a means to punish a nine year old child who bit his brother. In re Miles, 9th Dist. No. 01CA0054, 2002-Ohio-2438. In finding insufficient evidence of serious physical harm, the appellate court explained: Additionally, appellee argues that the bruising is an indication of serious physical harm. In this case, the alleged serious physical harm was “any physical harm that involves acute pain of such duration as to result in substantial suffering, or that involves any degree of prolonged or intractable pain.” See R.C. 2901.01(A)(5)(e). However, the record does not contain any evidence that acute pain resulted of any lasting duration to result in substantial suffering, or that it lasted for an extended period of time or was intractable. Although this act may be inappropriate and unwarranted, it did not rise to the level of being an offense of child abuse. Id. at ¶ 12-13. These cases are distinguishable from the case at hand; in this case there is evidence of treatment, pain caused from the paddling that lasted over a period of time, and medical testimony from the treating doctor. In all of the cases cited by Appellant the court notes the lack of evidence. However, there is evidence in this case. The victim’s mother testified it took the wound on the victim’s buttocks over two weeks to heal. Trial Tr. 183. The child victim testified it hurt when the Appellant hit him with the paddle board. Trial Tr. 202. As stated above the victim’s aunt described the injury as open, bleeding, and scabby. Trial Tr. 216. The victim told her it “hurt to sit and everything.” Trial Tr. 216. The picture the aunt took was shown to the jury. Trial Tr. 216; State’s Exhibit 1. Dr. John Melville from the CAC, whose entire professional career is devoted to child abuse pediatrics, indicated that at a two week follow-up visit, there was evidence of healing but the injury was not gone. Trial Tr. 245, 256-257. After one month of healing, the doctor testified there was further healing but the mark was still present. Trial Tr. 257. Pictures taken at the CAC were admitted into evidence. Trial Tr. 254; State’s Exhibit 2-5. The doctor was asked what are reasonable physical disciplinary measures. Trial Tr. 260. He explained nobody is opposed to physical discipline in general, but if it is to be administered then it is recommended to be hand to buttocks and that it not leave any marks that would persist for more than 4 to 5 minutes. Trial Tr. Based on what he observed in this case he opined that the victim's injury was the result of unreasonable physical discipline. Trial Tr. 261. In determining whether admittedly excessive corporal punishment caused substantial risk of serious physical harm to the child, the Fourth Appellate District has explained: “Discipline methods on a child which leave recognizable bruising and cause pain which lasts beyond the time immediately following an altercation between parent and the child may establish a finding of substantial risk of serious harm.” In re Kristen V., 6th Dist. Ottawa No. OT–07–031, 2008–Ohio–2994, ¶ 69. Bruising alone, however, is not sufficient to show that the discipline method created a substantial risk of serious physical harm. Schuerman, 74 Ohio App.3d at 532 (stating that “bruising alone is insufficient to establish abuse”). State v. Neal, 4th Dist. Nos. 14CA31, 14CA32, 2015-Ohio-5452, ¶ 45. Considering the testimony and viewing it in the light most favorable to the state, there was sufficient evidence of serious physical harm and substantial risk of serious physical harm. We note the state cites this court to cases upholding child endangering convictions where the victim had extensive bruising on the buttocks, legs and back and where that bruising lasted more than 3 days and up to 7 to 10 days. State v. Royster, 2d Dist. No. 25870, 2015-Ohio-3608, ¶ 30-31; In re Horton, 10th Dist. No. 03AP-1181, 2004-Ohio-6249, ¶ 27; State v. Krull, 154 Ohio App.3d 219, 2003-Ohio-4611, ¶ 20-23 (12th Dist.); State v. Burdine-Justice, 125 Ohio App.3d 707, 714-715, 709 N.E.2d 551 (12th Dist.1998). Admittedly, those cases are different from the case at hand in the type of injury sustained. Also, in some of the cases a belt was used instead of a paddle board. However, the abrasion caused by the paddling lasted over two weeks and there is testimony it caused the victim pain over an extended period of time. Furthermore, as the Twelfth Appellate District stated, “The force necessary to create such bruising must have been great, and was not accidental on the part of the perpetrator. Clearly, this amount of corporal punishment was unnecessary and unwarranted.” Burdine-Justice, 125 Ohio App.3d at 715. Consequently, although the cases upholding conviction vary from the one before us, the reasoning and the evidence presented in this case indicate they are more akin to the case sub judice than the ones cited by Appellant.

The portion of the felonious assault statute he was found guilty of violating states: (A) No person shall knowingly do either of the following: (1) Cause serious physical harm to another or to another's unborn; (D)(1)(a) Whoever violates this section is guilty of felonious assault. Except as otherwise provided in this division or division (D)(1)(b) of this section, felonious assault is a felony of the second degree. R.C. 2903.11(A)(1)(D). Appellant was found guilty of second-degree felony child endangering defined as: (B) No person shall do any of the following to a child under eighteen years of age or a mentally or physically handicapped child under twenty-one years of age: *** (3) Administer corporal punishment or other physical disciplinary measure, or physically restrain the child in a cruel manner or for a prolonged period, which punishment, discipline, or restraint is excessive under the circumstances and creates a substantial risk of serious physical harm to the child; *** (E)(1) Whoever violates this section is guilty of endangering children. *** (3) If the offender violates division (B)(2), (3), (4), or (6) of this section, except as otherwise provided in this division, endangering children is a felony of the third degree. If the violation results in serious physical harm to the child involved, or if the offender previously has been convicted of an offense under this section or of any offense involving neglect, abandonment, contributing to the delinquency of, or physical abuse of a child, endangering children is a felony of the second degree. R.C. 2919.22(B)(3)(E)(1)(3). Appellant was found to have caused serious physical harm under this statute. Appellant was also found guilty of third-degree felony child endangering as defined as: (A) No person, who is the parent, guardian, custodian, person having custody or control, or person in loco parentis of a child under eighteen years of age or a mentally or physically handicapped child under twenty-one years of age, shall create a substantial risk to the health or safety of the child, by violating a duty of care, protection, or support. It is not a violation of a duty of care, protection, or support under this division when the parent, guardian, custodian, or person having custody or control of a child treats the physical or mental illness or defect of the child by spiritual means through prayer alone, in accordance with the tenets of a recognized religious body. *** (E)(1) Whoever violates this section is guilty of endangering children.

R.C. 2919.22(A)(E)(1)(2)(c). The felonious assault and both child endangering crimes have a common element – to have caused serious physical harm. Second degree felony child endangering also requires a substantial risk of serious physical harm and excessive corporal punishment. These are the elements Appellant focuses on in this assignment of error. He asserts the paddling was not excessive. He contends there was no evidence that paddling a fully clothed child created a substantial risk of serious physical harm. He also argues the abrasion on the victim's buttocks does not amount to serious physical harm. The analysis begins with whether there was sufficient evidence produced by the state to show the administration of corporal punishment was excessive under the circumstances. This is an element of the second-degree felony child endangering crime. It is undisputed in this case that the injury was caused by the administering of a paddle board on the victim's clothed buttocks. The victim confirmed this admission. We have previously stated that in corporal discipline cases, the state must prove the corporal discipline was improper in light of all of the surrounding facts and circumstances. State v. Rosa, 7th Dist. No. 12 MA 60, 2013-Ohio-5867, 6 N.E.3d 57, ¶ 41. The factors to be considered are: (1) the child's age; (2) the child's behavior leading up to the discipline; (3) the child's response to prior non-corporal punishment; (4) the location and severity of the punishment; and (5) the parent's state of mind while administering the punishment. Id., quoting State v. Luke, 3d Dist. No. 14-10-26, 2011-Ohio-4330, ¶ 23; State v. Hart, 110 Ohio App.3d 250, 255–56, 673 N.E.2d 992 (3d Dist.1996) (“The propriety and reasonableness of corporal punishment in each case must be judged in light of the totality of the circumstances.”). In the case at hand, the victim was 11 years old. The victim was not correctly completing a math problem and this led to the paddling; Appellant admitted the victim was not a behavioral problem. Trial Tr. 322, 324. Appellant testified he used fear and discipline to get his students to focus. Trial Tr. 320. Appellant testified he gave the victim the opportunity to get the math problems correct, but the victim would not carry the digit correctly and kept getting the problems wrong. Trial Tr. 325. Testimony indicated Appellant yelled and scared his students prior to paddling them. Trial Tr. 284; 320. It is undisputed the victim was paddled on his clothed buttocks five times during one tutoring session. Trial Tr. 326. The victim’s aunt, who was the first person the victim showed the injury, described it as follows: It was – his skin was reddish and purplish and it had a scab. You could see like the where the pores of his skin was so open that they were bleeding, you know, it was bleeding out, and it was like holes. You could actually see holes in it. And I asked him, I said, does it hurt? He said, yes, it hurts to sit and everything. So I put gauze, and I put Neosporin on it, and I bandaged it up and tried to cushion it as much as possible. But I had to – I sent a text to his mom and showed her the picture. Trial Tr. 216. Dr. John Melville from the CAC testified at trial. Trial Tr. 241-242. He saw the victim the day after the injury was shown to the aunt. He described the injury as a crescent shaped abrasion about 6cm by 1cm. Trial Tr. 255. It was dark red and there was evidence of some healing. Trial Tr. 255. At the two week follow up visit there was evidence of healing, but the injury was not gone. Trial Tr. 256-257. After one month of healing, the doctor testified there was further healing but the mark was still present. Trial Tr. 257. Pictures taken at the CAC were admitted into evidence. Trial Tr. 254; State’s Exhibit 2-5. Appellant testified he did not want to hurt the victim. Trial Tr. 328. He explained he taught in a fear induced learning environment. Trial Tr. 320. He stated it was “like an exorcism” to get the victim to carry the number correctly in doing a three digit math problem. Trial Tr. 325. Considering these facts in the light most favorable to the prosecution the punishment was improper and excessive. As to the felonious assault and third-degree felony child endangering convictions, the question is whether there was serious physical harm to the child. As there was sufficient evidence of excessive corporal punishment, the analysis for the second-degree felony child endangering conviction is whether there was a substantial risk of serious physical harm to the child. “Serious physical harm to persons” is defined as: (a) Any mental illness or condition of such gravity as would normally require hospitalization or prolonged psychiatric treatment; (b) Any physical harm that carries a substantial risk of death; (c) Any physical harm that involves some permanent incapacity, whether partial or total, or that involves some temporary, substantial incapacity; (d) Any physical harm that involves some permanent disfigurement or that involves some temporary, serious disfigurement; (e) Any physical harm that involves acute pain of such duration as to result in substantial suffering or that involves any degree of prolonged or intractable pain. R.C. 2901.01(A)(5). “Substantial risk” is defined as “a strong possibility, as contrasted with a remote or significant possibility, that a certain result may occur or that certain circumstances may exist.” R.C. 2901.01(A)(8). Appellant cites this court to a case where the appellate court found there was not sufficient evidence of serious physical harm or substantial risk of serious physical harm. He contends the cases cited by him are examples of worse conduct by an offender and the appellate court found there was not sufficient evidence of the crimes. Three of the cases - Ivey, Wright, and Enovitch - are from the Eighth Appellate District and are from the mid to late 1990s. In Ivey, the child had welts and bruises on his buttocks and legs from being beat with a belt for disciplinary reasons. State v. Ivey, 98 Ohio App.3d 249, 648 N.E.2d 519 (8th Dist.1994). In reversing the conviction, the Eighth Appellate District court stated: Although the punishment may have been excessive, the state produced no evidence that the bruises and welts caused by the strapping resulted in serious physical harm or created a substantial risk of serious physical harm. On the contrary, the evidence showed the boy went to school, without incident, the next day. There was no evidence he was in great pain or that he had trouble sitting or walking. The treating physician did not find it necessary to hospitalize the boy, order any type of pain killer (even aspirin), or to schedule another medical exam to check on his progress. The evidence presented in the record shows the injuries sustained by the child were the result of the imposition of corporal punishment by a father who judged his son's school conduct and acts of deception warranted a strong physical disciplinary response. The state failed to prove by sufficient evidence that this type of whipping resulted in serious physical harm or could result in a substantial risk of serious physical harm to the child. Id. at 524. Similarly in the other two Eighth Appellate District cases the court found there was not sufficient evidence of serious physical harm. City of Shaker Hts. v. Wright, 8th Dist. No. 69517, 1996 WL 355309 (June 27, 1996); State v. Enovitch, 8th Dist. No. 72827, 1998 WL 518163 (Aug. 20, 1998). Wright was a child endangering case and in that case the court explained: This conclusion, that the element of seriousness was lacking, is buttressed by the following: (1) the marks were small and were receding over time; (2) the emergency room physician testified that he thought that there was no scarring at the site of the marks and did not feel there had been any abuse; (3) the emergency room report identified the marks as bruises or contusions, not scars; (4) while the injury site was sore the evening it was inflicted, the injury did not prevent the boy from sleeping and the victim experienced no pain at the site of the injury the morning after the injury was inflicted and thereafter enjoyed his normal activities without pain or difficulty; (5) the injury required no follow-up medical care or physical therapy; and, (6) the treating physician did not hospitalize the boy. Accordingly, the City failed to prove by sufficient evidence that this type of whipping resulted in serious physical harm or could result in a substantial risk of serious physical harm to the child. Wright, 8th Dist. No. 69517. Enovitch was a felonious assault case and in that case the court explained: Other than Gartman's statement, there was no evidence at trial that the scar above his eye was permanent. There is no evidence as to who told him the scar would not go away or that the person was qualified to make such a determination. The hospital records described his injury as just over 1.5 centimeters in length and as a “burst-type injury, clean, shallow, not particularly jagged.” The hospital discharge instructions characterized the injury as “minor.” Based upon the evidence presented, we conclude that Gartman's injury did not constitute the serious physical harm required for a felonious assault conviction. Accordingly, Enovitch's second assignment of error is well taken. Enovitch, 8th Dist. No. 72827. Appellant also cites In re L.J., 176 Ohio App.3d 186, 2008-Ohio-1488, 891 N.E.2d 778 (3d Dist.). In that case, the appellate court found the trial court erred as a matter of law when it concluded the child was “abused” under R.C. 2151.031(C) because of corporal punishment. Id. at ¶ 45. The appellate court explained the evidence was insufficient to show the corporal punishment was excessive and to show that it created a substantial risk of serious physical harm: While we certainly share the trial court's sentiment that striking a child with a belt on back of the legs supports a finding that the punishment was excessive, this court has stated that corporal punishment on parts of the body other than the buttocks may be proper and reasonable. Hart, 110 Ohio App.3d at 255, 673 N.E.2d 992. In addition, Skinner testified that she had intended to strike J.L. on the butt; however, J.L. moved, which is why she missed. As to the severity, the marks were red but also appeared to be fading and healing within three to four days after the incident, which indicates that the discipline may not have been excessive. Skinner also testified that she did not observe bruises on J.L. after the incident. The record lacks any medical evidence, which would lead one to conclude that the discipline was excessive. No physician testified at the hearing, nor was any medical report admitted into evidence showing that J.L. required medical attention as a result of the discipline. In fact, on the day the caseworker discovered the bruises, J.L. was outside playing with his brother. * * * We also cannot conclude that the punishment created a substantial risk of serious physical harm as those terms are defined. The evidence presented consisted of Core’s testimony and the photographs, which, for the most part, revealed that J.L. was bruised. Our review of the admitted photographic evidence confirms that J.L. was bruised, but bruising alone is not sufficient to constitute serious physical harm. In re Schuerman, 74 Ohio App.3d at 532, 599 N.E.2d 728 (trial court could reasonably infer that severe bruising on the buttocks, thighs, and ankles from punishment that was inflicted multiple times for the same misbehavior with a wooden paddle or belt on an eight-year-old girl created a substantial risk of serious physical harm). Other courts have found that punishment much more severe than J.L.’s did not constitute serious physical harm. See, e.g., Ivey, 98 Ohio App.3d at 255–256, 648 N.E.2d 519 (bruised left eyelid, bruises, welts, and lacerations caused by a belt whipping on the buttocks and lower legs and a swollen hand was not “serious physical harm”). Again, notably missing from the record is any medical evidence or reports to show that J.L.’s injuries amounted to serious physical harm. On the basis of this record, we cannot conclude that the corporal punishment caused a substantial risk of serious physical harm. Id. at ¶ 41, 44. Appellant also cites a biting case where the parents used biting as a means to punish a nine year old child who bit his brother. In re Miles, 9th Dist. No. 01CA0054, 2002-Ohio-2438. In finding insufficient evidence of serious physical harm, the appellate court explained: Additionally, appellee argues that the bruising is an indication of serious physical harm. In this case, the alleged serious physical harm was “any physical harm that involves acute pain of such duration as to result in substantial suffering, or that involves any degree of prolonged or intractable pain.” See R.C. 2901.01(A)(5)(e). However, the record does not contain any evidence that acute pain resulted of any lasting duration to result in substantial suffering, or that it lasted for an extended period of time or was intractable. Although this act may be inappropriate and unwarranted, it did not rise to the level of being an offense of child abuse. Id. at ¶ 12-13. These cases are distinguishable from the case at hand; in this case there is evidence of treatment, pain caused from the paddling that lasted over a period of time, and medical testimony from the treating doctor. In all of the cases cited by Appellant the court notes the lack of evidence. However, there is evidence in this case. The victim’s mother testified it took the wound on the victim’s buttocks over two weeks to heal. Trial Tr. 183. The child victim testified it hurt when the Appellant hit him with the paddle board. Trial Tr. 202. As stated above the victim’s aunt described the injury as open, bleeding, and scabby. Trial Tr. 216. The victim told her it “hurt to sit and everything.” Trial Tr. 216. The picture the aunt took was shown to the jury. Trial Tr. 216; State’s Exhibit 1. Dr. John Melville from the CAC, whose entire professional career is devoted to child abuse pediatrics, indicated that at a two week follow-up visit, there was evidence of healing but the injury was not gone. Trial Tr. 245, 256-257. After one month of healing, the doctor testified there was further healing but the mark was still present. Trial Tr. 257. Pictures taken at the CAC were admitted into evidence. Trial Tr. 254; State’s Exhibit 2-5. The doctor was asked what are reasonable physical disciplinary measures. Trial Tr. 260. He explained nobody is opposed to physical discipline in general, but if it is to be administered then it is recommended to be hand to buttocks and that it not leave any marks that would persist for more than 4 to 5 minutes. Trial Tr. Based on what he observed in this case he opined that the victim's injury was the result of unreasonable physical discipline. Trial Tr. 261. In determining whether admittedly excessive corporal punishment caused substantial risk of serious physical harm to the child, the Fourth Appellate District has explained: “Discipline methods on a child which leave recognizable bruising and cause pain which lasts beyond the time immediately following an altercation between parent and the child may establish a finding of substantial risk of serious harm.” In re Kristen V., 6th Dist. Ottawa No. OT–07–031, 2008–Ohio–2994, ¶ 69. Bruising alone, however, is not sufficient to show that the discipline method created a substantial risk of serious physical harm. Schuerman, 74 Ohio App.3d at 532 (stating that “bruising alone is insufficient to establish abuse”). State v. Neal, 4th Dist. Nos. 14CA31, 14CA32, 2015-Ohio-5452, ¶ 45. Considering the testimony and viewing it in the light most favorable to the state, there was sufficient evidence of serious physical harm and substantial risk of serious physical harm. We note the state cites this court to cases upholding child endangering convictions where the victim had extensive bruising on the buttocks, legs and back and where that bruising lasted more than 3 days and up to 7 to 10 days. State v. Royster, 2d Dist. No. 25870, 2015-Ohio-3608, ¶ 30-31; In re Horton, 10th Dist. No. 03AP-1181, 2004-Ohio-6249, ¶ 27; State v. Krull, 154 Ohio App.3d 219, 2003-Ohio-4611, ¶ 20-23 (12th Dist.); State v. Burdine-Justice, 125 Ohio App.3d 707, 714-715, 709 N.E.2d 551 (12th Dist.1998). Admittedly, those cases are different from the case at hand in the type of injury sustained. Also, in some of the cases a belt was used instead of a paddle board. However, the abrasion caused by the paddling lasted over two weeks and there is testimony it caused the victim pain over an extended period of time. Furthermore, as the Twelfth Appellate District stated, “The force necessary to create such bruising must have been great, and was not accidental on the part of the perpetrator. Clearly, this amount of corporal punishment was unnecessary and unwarranted.” Burdine-Justice, 125 Ohio App.3d at 715. Consequently, although the cases upholding conviction vary from the one before us, the reasoning and the evidence presented in this case indicate they are more akin to the case sub judice than the ones cited by Appellant. This court concludes there was sufficient evidence of excessive corporal punishment, serious physical harm, and substantial risk of serious physical harm. This assignment of error is meritless.\"\n}\n```"}

Appellant cites this court to a case where the appellate court found there was not sufficient evidence of serious physical harm or substantial risk of serious physical harm. He contends the cases cited by him are examples of worse conduct by an offender and the appellate court found there was not sufficient evidence of the crimes. Three of the cases - Ivey, Wright, and Enovitch - are from the Eighth Appellate District and are from the mid to late 1990s. In Ivey, the child had welts and bruises on his buttocks and legs from being beat with a belt for disciplinary reasons. State v. Ivey, 98 Ohio App.3d 249, 648 N.E.2d 519 (8th Dist.1994).

Enovitch was a felonious assault case and in that case the court explained: Other than Gartman's statement, there was no evidence at trial that the scar above his eye was permanent. There is no evidence as to who told him the scar would not go away or that the person was qualified to make such a determination. The hospital records described his injury as just over 1.5 centimeters in length and as a “burst-type injury, clean, shallow, not particularly jagged.” The hospital discharge instructions characterized the injury as “minor.” Based upon the evidence presented, we conclude that Gartman's injury did not constitute the serious physical harm required for a felonious assault conviction. Accordingly, Enovitch's second assignment of error is well taken. Enovitch, 8th Dist. No. 72827. Appellant also cites In re L.J., 176 Ohio App.3d 186, 2008-Ohio-1488, 891 N.E.2d 778 (3d Dist.). In that case, the appellate court found the trial court erred as a matter of law when it concluded the child was “abused” under R.C. 2151.031(C) because of corporal punishment. Id. at ¶ 45. The appellate court explained the evidence was insufficient to show the corporal punishment was excessive and to show that it created a substantial risk of serious physical harm: While we certainly share the trial court's sentiment that striking a child with a belt on back of the legs supports a finding that the punishment was excessive, this court has stated that corporal punishment on parts of the body other than the buttocks may be proper and reasonable. Hart, 110 Ohio App.3d at 255, 673 N.E.2d 992. In addition, Skinner testified that she had intended to strike J.L. on the butt; however, J.L. moved, which is why she missed. As to the severity, the marks were red but also appeared to be fading and healing within three to four days after the incident, which indicates that the discipline may not have been excessive. Skinner also testified that she did not observe bruises on J.L. after the incident. The record lacks any medical evidence, which would lead one to conclude that the discipline was excessive. No physician testified at the hearing, nor was any medical report admitted into evidence showing that J.L. required medical attention as a result of the discipline. In fact, on the day the caseworker discovered the bruises, J.L. was outside playing with his brother. * * * We also cannot conclude that the punishment created a substantial risk of serious physical harm as those terms are defined. The evidence presented consisted of Core’s testimony and the photographs, which, for the most part, revealed that J.L. was bruised. Our review of the admitted photographic evidence confirms that J.L. was bruised, but bruising alone is not sufficient to constitute serious physical harm. In re Schuerman, 74 Ohio App.3d at 532, 599 N.E.2d 728 (trial court could reasonably infer that severe bruising on the buttocks, thighs, and ankles from punishment that was inflicted multiple times for the same misbehavior with a wooden paddle or belt on an eight-year-old girl created a substantial risk of serious physical harm). Other courts have found that punishment much more severe than J.L.’s did not constitute serious physical harm. See, e.g., Ivey, 98 Ohio App.3d at 255–256, 648 N.E.2d 519 (bruised left eyelid, bruises, welts, and lacerations caused by a belt whipping on the buttocks and lower legs and a swollen hand was not “serious physical harm”). Again, notably missing from the record is any medical evidence or reports to show that J.L.’s injuries amounted to serious physical harm. On the basis of this record, we cannot conclude that the corporal punishment caused a substantial risk of serious physical harm. Id. at ¶ 41, 44. Appellant also cites a biting case where the parents used biting as a means to punish a nine year old child who bit his brother. In re Miles, 9th Dist. No. 01CA0054, 2002-Ohio-2438. In finding insufficient evidence of serious physical harm, the appellate court explained: Additionally, appellee argues that the bruising is an indication of serious physical harm. In this case, the alleged serious physical harm was “any physical harm that involves acute pain of such duration as to result in substantial suffering, or that involves any degree of prolonged or intractable pain.” See R.C. 2901.01(A)(5)(e). However, the record does not contain any evidence that acute pain resulted of any lasting duration to result in substantial suffering, or that it lasted for an extended period of time or was intractable. Although this act may be inappropriate and unwarranted, it did not rise to the level of being an offense of child abuse. Id. at ¶ 12-13. These cases are distinguishable from the case at hand; in this case there is evidence of treatment, pain caused from the paddling that lasted over a period of time, and medical testimony from the treating doctor. In all of the cases cited by Appellant the court notes the lack of evidence. However, there is evidence in this case. The victim’s mother testified it took the wound on the victim’s buttocks over two weeks to heal. Trial Tr. 183. The child victim testified it hurt when the Appellant hit him with the paddle board. Trial Tr. 202. As stated above the victim’s aunt described the injury as open, bleeding, and scabby. Trial Tr. 216. The victim told her it “hurt to sit and everything.” Trial Tr. 216. The picture the aunt took was shown to the jury. Trial Tr. 216; State’s Exhibit 1. Dr. John Melville from the CAC, whose entire professional career is devoted to child abuse pediatrics, indicated that at a two week follow-up visit, there was evidence of healing but the injury was not gone. Trial Tr. 245, 256-257. After one month of healing, the doctor testified there was further healing but the mark was still present. Trial Tr. 257. Pictures taken at the CAC were admitted into evidence. Trial Tr. 254; State’s Exhibit 2-5. The doctor was asked what are reasonable physical disciplinary measures. Trial Tr. 260. He explained nobody is opposed to physical discipline in general, but if it is to be administered then it is recommended to be hand to buttocks and that it not leave any marks that would persist for more than 4 to 5 minutes. Trial Tr. Based on what he observed in this case he opined that the victim's injury was the result of unreasonable physical discipline. Trial Tr. 261. In determining whether admittedly excessive corporal punishment caused substantial risk of serious physical harm to the child, the Fourth Appellate District has explained: “Discipline methods on a child which leave recognizable bruising and cause pain which lasts beyond the time immediately following an altercation between parent and the child may establish a finding of substantial risk of serious harm.” In re Kristen V., 6th Dist. Ottawa No. OT–07–031, 2008–Ohio–2994, ¶ 69. Bruising alone, however, is not sufficient to show that the discipline method created a substantial risk of serious physical harm. Schuerman, 74 Ohio App.3d at 532 (stating that “bruising alone is insufficient to establish abuse”). State v. Neal, 4th Dist. Nos. 14CA31, 14CA32, 2015-Ohio-5452, ¶ 45. Considering the testimony and viewing it in the light most favorable to the state, there was sufficient evidence of serious physical harm and substantial risk of serious physical harm. We note the state cites this court to cases upholding child endangering convictions where the victim had extensive bruising on the buttocks, legs and back and where that bruising lasted more than 3 days and up to 7 to 10 days. State v. Royster, 2d Dist. No. 25870, 2015-Ohio-3608, ¶ 30-31; In re Horton, 10th Dist. No. 03AP-1181, 2004-Ohio-6249, ¶ 27; State v. Krull, 154 Ohio App.3d 219, 2003-Ohio-4611, ¶ 20-23 (12th Dist.); State v. Burdine-Justice, 125 Ohio App.3d 707, 714-715, 709 N.E.2d 551 (12th Dist.1998). Admittedly, those cases are different from the case at hand in the type of injury sustained. Also, in some of the cases a belt was used instead of a paddle board. However, the abrasion caused by the paddling lasted over two weeks and there is testimony it caused the victim pain over an extended period of time. Furthermore, as the Twelfth Appellate District stated, “The force necessary to create such bruising must have been great, and was not accidental on the part of the perpetrator. Clearly, this amount of corporal punishment was unnecessary and unwarranted.” Burdine-Justice, 125 Ohio App.3d at 715. Consequently, although the cases upholding conviction vary from the one before us, the reasoning and the evidence presented in this case indicate they are more akin to the case sub judice than the ones cited by Appellant. This court concludes there was sufficient evidence of excessive corporal punishment, serious physical harm, and substantial risk of serious physical harm. This assignment of error is meritless.\"\n}\n```"}

The portion of the felonious assault statute he was found guilty of violating states: (A) No person shall knowingly do either of the following: (1) Cause serious physical harm to another or to another's unborn; (D)(1)(a) Whoever violates this section is guilty of felonious assault. Except as otherwise provided in this division or division (D)(1)(b) of this section, felonious assault is a felony of the second degree. R.C. 2903.11(A)(1)(D). Appellant was found guilty of second-degree felony child endangering defined as: (B) No person shall do any of the following to a child under eighteen years of age or a mentally or physically handicapped child under twenty-one years of age: *** (3) Administer corporal punishment or other physical disciplinary measure, or physically restrain the child in a cruel manner or for a prolonged period, which punishment, discipline, or restraint is excessive under the circumstances and creates a substantial risk of serious physical harm to the child; *** (E)(1) Whoever violates this section is guilty of endangering children. *** (3) If the offender violates division (B)(2), (3), (4), or (6) of this section, except as otherwise provided in this division, endangering children is a felony of the third degree. If the violation results in serious physical harm to the child involved, or if the offender previously has been convicted of an offense under this section or of any offense involving neglect, abandonment, contributing to the delinquency of, or physical abuse of a child, endangering children is a felony of the second degree. R.C. 2919.22(B)(3)(E)(1)(3). Appellant was found to have caused serious physical harm under this statute. Appellant was also found guilty of third-degree felony child endangering as defined as: (A) No person, who is the parent, guardian, custodian, person having custody or control, or person in loco parentis of a child under eighteen years of age or a mentally or physically handicapped child under twenty-one years of age, shall create a substantial risk to the health or safety of the child, by violating a duty of care, protection, or support. It is not a violation of a duty of care, protection, or support under this division when the parent, guardian, custodian, or person having custody or control of a child treats the physical or mental illness or defect of the child by spiritual means through prayer alone, in accordance with the tenets of a recognized religious body. *** (E)(1) Whoever violates this section is guilty of endangering children. (2) If the offender violates division (A) or (B)(1) of this section, endangering children is one of the following, and, in the circumstances described in division (E)(2)(e) of this section, that division applies: *** (c) If the violation is a violation of division (A) of this section and results in serious physical harm to the child involved, a felony of the third degree. R.C. 2919.22(A)(E)(1)(2)(c). The felonious assault and both child endangering crimes have a common element – to have caused serious physical harm. Second degree felony child endangering also requires a substantial risk of serious physical harm and excessive corporal punishment. These are the elements Appellant focuses on in this assignment of error. He asserts the paddling was not excessive. He contends there was no evidence that paddling a fully clothed child created a substantial risk of serious physical harm. He also argues the abrasion on the victim's buttocks does not amount to serious physical harm. The analysis begins with whether there was sufficient evidence produced by the state to show the administration of corporal punishment was excessive under the circumstances. This is an element of the second-degree felony child endangering crime. It is undisputed in this case that the injury was caused by the administering of a paddle board on the victim's clothed buttocks. The victim confirmed this admission. We have previously stated that in corporal discipline cases, the state must prove the corporal discipline was improper in light of all of the surrounding facts and circumstances. State v. Rosa, 7th Dist. No. 12 MA 60, 2013-Ohio-5867, 6 N.E.3d 57, ¶ 41. The factors to be considered are: (1) the child's age; (2) the child's behavior leading up to the discipline; (3) the child's response to prior non-corporal punishment; (4) the location and severity of the punishment; and (5) the parent's state of mind while administering the punishment. Id., quoting State v. Luke, 3d Dist. No. 14-10-26, 2011-Ohio-4330, ¶ 23; State v. Hart, 110 Ohio App.3d 250, 255–56, 673 N.E.2d 992 (3d Dist.1996) (“The propriety and reasonableness of corporal punishment in each case must be judged in light of the totality of the circumstances.”). In the case at hand, the victim was 11 years old. The victim was not correctly completing a math problem and this led to the paddling; Appellant admitted the victim was not a behavioral problem. Trial Tr. 322, 324. Appellant testified he used fear and discipline to get his students to focus. Trial Tr. 320. Appellant testified he gave the victim the opportunity to get the math problems correct, but the victim would not carry the digit correctly and kept getting the problems wrong. Trial Tr. 325. Testimony indicated Appellant yelled and scared his students prior to paddling them. Trial Tr. 284; 320. It is undisputed the victim was paddled on his clothed buttocks five times during one tutoring session. Trial Tr. 326. The victim’s aunt, who was the first person the victim showed the injury, described it as follows: It was – his skin was reddish and purplish and it had a scab. You could see like the where the pores of his skin was so open that they were bleeding, you know, it was bleeding out, and it was like holes. You could actually see holes in it. And I asked him, I said, does it hurt? He said, yes, it hurts to sit and everything. So I put gauze, and I put Neosporin on it, and I bandaged it up and tried to cushion it as much as possible. But I had to – I sent a text to his mom and showed her the picture. Trial Tr. 216. Dr. John Melville from the CAC testified at trial. Trial Tr. 241-242. He saw the victim the day after the injury was shown to the aunt. He described the injury as a crescent shaped abrasion about 6cm by 1cm. Trial Tr. 255. It was dark red and there was evidence of some healing. Trial Tr. 255. At the two week follow up visit there was evidence of healing, but the injury was not gone. Trial Tr. 256-257. After one month of healing, the doctor testified there was further healing but the mark was still present. Trial Tr. 257. Pictures taken at the CAC were admitted into evidence. Trial Tr. 254; State’s Exhibit 2-5. Appellant testified he did not want to hurt the victim. Trial Tr. 328. He explained he taught in a fear induced learning environment. Trial Tr. 320. He stated it was “like an exorcism” to get the victim to carry the number correctly in doing a three digit math problem. Trial Tr. 325. Considering these facts in the light most favorable to the prosecution the punishment was improper and excessive. As to the felonious assault and third-degree felony child endangering convictions, the question is whether there was serious physical harm to the child. As there was sufficient evidence of excessive corporal punishment, the analysis for the second-degree felony child endangering conviction is whether there was a substantial risk of serious physical harm to the child. “Serious physical harm to persons” is defined as: (a) Any mental illness or condition of such gravity as would normally require hospitalization or prolonged psychiatric treatment; (b) Any physical harm that carries a substantial risk of death; (c) Any physical harm that involves some permanent incapacity, whether partial or total, or that involves some temporary, substantial incapacity; (d) Any physical harm that involves some permanent disfigurement or that involves some temporary, serious disfigurement; (e) Any physical harm that involves acute pain of such duration as to result in substantial suffering or that involves any degree of prolonged or intractable pain. R.C. 2901.01(A)(5). “Substantial risk” is defined as “a strong possibility, as contrasted with a remote or significant possibility, that a certain result may occur or that certain circumstances may exist.” R.C. 2901.01(A)(8). Appellant cites this court to a case where the appellate court found there was not sufficient evidence of serious physical harm or substantial risk of serious physical harm. He contends the cases cited by him are examples of worse conduct by an offender and the appellate court found there was not sufficient evidence of the crimes. Three of the cases - Ivey, Wright, and Enovitch - are from the Eighth Appellate District and are from the mid to late 1990s. In Ivey, the child had welts and bruises on his buttocks and legs from being beat with a belt for disciplinary reasons. State v. Ivey, 98 Ohio App.3d 249, 648 N.E.2d 519 (8th Dist.1994). In reversing the conviction, the Eighth Appellate District court stated: Although the punishment may have been excessive, the state produced no evidence that the bruises and welts caused by the strapping resulted in serious physical harm or created a substantial risk of serious physical harm. On the contrary, the evidence showed the boy went to school, without incident, the next day. There was no evidence he was in great pain or that he had trouble sitting or walking. The treating physician did not find it necessary to hospitalize the boy, order any type of pain killer (even aspirin), or to schedule another medical exam to check on his progress. The evidence presented in the record shows the injuries sustained by the child were the result of the imposition of corporal punishment by a father who judged his son's school conduct and acts of deception warranted a strong physical disciplinary response. The state failed to prove by sufficient evidence that this type of whipping resulted in serious physical harm or could result in a substantial risk of serious physical harm to the child. Id. at 524. Similarly in the other two Eighth Appellate District cases the court found there was not sufficient evidence of serious physical harm. City of Shaker Hts. v. Wright, 8th Dist. No. 69517, 1996 WL 355309 (June 27, 1996); State v. Enovitch, 8th Dist. No. 72827, 1998 WL 518163 (Aug. 20, 1998). Wright was a child endangering case and in that case the court explained: This conclusion, that the element of seriousness was lacking, is buttressed by the following: (1) the marks were small and were receding over time; (2) the emergency room physician testified that he thought that there was no scarring at the site of the marks and did not feel there had been any abuse; (3) the emergency room report identified the marks as bruises or contusions, not scars; (4) while the injury site was sore the evening it was inflicted, the injury did not prevent the boy from sleeping and the victim experienced no pain at the site of the injury the morning after the injury was inflicted and thereafter enjoyed his normal activities without pain or difficulty; (5) the injury required no follow-up medical care or physical therapy; and, (6) the treating physician did not hospitalize the boy. Accordingly, the City failed to prove by sufficient evidence that this type of whipping resulted in serious physical harm or could result in a substantial risk of serious physical harm to the child. Wright, 8th Dist. No. 69517. Enovitch was a felonious assault case and in that case the court explained: Other than Gartman's statement, there was no evidence at trial that the scar above his eye was permanent. There is no evidence as to who told him the scar would not go away or that the person was qualified to make such a determination. The hospital records described his injury as just over 1.5 centimeters in length and as a “burst-type injury, clean, shallow, not particularly jagged.” The hospital discharge instructions characterized the injury as “minor.” Based upon the evidence presented, we conclude that Gartman's injury did not constitute the serious physical harm required for a felonious assault conviction. Accordingly, Enovitch's second assignment of error is well taken. Enovitch, 8th Dist. No. 72827. Appellant also cites In re L.J., 176 Ohio App.3d 186, 2008-Ohio-1488, 891 N.E.2d 778 (3d Dist.). In that case, the appellate court found the trial court erred as a matter of law when it concluded the child was “abused” under R.C. 2151.031(C) because of corporal punishment. Id. at ¶ 45. The appellate court explained the evidence was insufficient to show the corporal punishment was excessive and to show that it created a substantial risk of serious physical harm: While we certainly share the trial court's sentiment that striking a child with a belt on back of the legs supports a finding that the punishment was excessive, this court has stated that corporal punishment on parts of the body other than the buttocks may be proper and reasonable. Hart, 110 Ohio App.3d at 255, 673 N.E.2d 992. In addition, Skinner testified that she had intended to strike J.L. on the butt; however, J.L. moved, which is why she missed. As to the severity, the marks were red but also appeared to be fading and healing within three to four days after the incident, which indicates that the discipline may not have been excessive. Skinner also testified that she did not observe bruises on J.L. after the incident. The record lacks any medical evidence, which would lead one to conclude that the discipline was excessive. No physician testified at the hearing, nor was any medical report admitted into evidence showing that J.L. required medical attention as a result of the discipline. In fact, on the day the caseworker discovered the bruises, J.L. was outside playing with his brother. * * * We also cannot conclude that the punishment created a substantial risk of serious physical harm as those terms are defined. The evidence presented consisted of Core’s testimony and the photographs, which, for the most part, revealed that J.L. was bruised. Our review of the admitted photographic evidence confirms that J.L. was bruised, but bruising alone is not sufficient to constitute serious physical harm. In re Schuerman, 74 Ohio App.3d at 532, 599 N.E.2d 728 (trial court could reasonably infer that severe bruising on the buttocks, thighs, and ankles from punishment that was inflicted multiple times for the same misbehavior with a wooden paddle or belt on an eight-year-old girl created a substantial risk of serious physical harm). Other courts have found that punishment much more severe than J.L.’s did not constitute serious physical harm. See, e.g., Ivey, 98 Ohio App.3d at 255–256, 648 N.E.2d 519 (bruised left eyelid, bruises, welts, and lacerations caused by a belt whipping on the buttocks and lower legs and a swollen hand was not “serious physical harm”). Again, notably missing from the record is any medical evidence or reports to show that J.L.’s injuries amounted to serious physical harm. On the basis of this record, we cannot conclude that the corporal punishment caused a substantial risk of serious physical harm. Id. at ¶ 41, 44. Appellant also cites a biting case where the parents used biting as a means to punish a nine year old child who bit his brother. In re Miles, 9th Dist. No. 01CA0054, 2002-Ohio-2438. In finding insufficient evidence of serious physical harm, the appellate court explained: Additionally, appellee argues that the bruising is an indication of serious physical harm. In this case, the alleged serious physical harm was “any physical harm that involves acute pain of such duration as to result in substantial suffering, or that involves any degree of prolonged or intractable pain.” See R.C. 2901.01(A)(5)(e). However, the record does not contain any evidence that acute pain resulted of any lasting duration to result in substantial suffering, or that it lasted for an extended period of time or was intractable. Although this act may be inappropriate and unwarranted, it did not rise to the level of being an offense of child abuse. Id. at ¶ 12-13. These cases are distinguishable from the case at hand; in this case there is evidence of treatment, pain caused from the paddling that lasted over a period of time, and medical testimony from the treating doctor. In all of the cases cited by Appellant the court notes the lack of evidence. However, there is evidence in this case.

Trial Tr. Based on what he observed in this case he opined that the victim's injury was the result of unreasonable physical discipline. Trial Tr. 261. In determining whether admittedly excessive corporal punishment caused substantial risk of serious physical harm to the child, the Fourth Appellate District has explained: “Discipline methods on a child which leave recognizable bruising and cause pain which lasts beyond the time immediately following an altercation between parent and the child may establish a finding of substantial risk of serious harm.” In re Kristen V., 6th Dist. Ottawa No. OT–07–031, 2008–Ohio–2994, ¶ 69. Bruising alone, however, is not sufficient to show that the discipline method created a substantial risk of serious physical harm. Schuerman, 74 Ohio App.3d at 532 (stating that “bruising alone is insufficient to establish abuse”). State v. Neal, 4th Dist. Nos. 14CA31, 14CA32, 2015-Ohio-5452, ¶ 45. Considering the testimony and viewing it in the light most favorable to the state, there was sufficient evidence of serious physical harm and substantial risk of serious physical harm. We note the state cites this court to cases upholding child endangering convictions where the victim had extensive bruising on the buttocks, legs and back and where that bruising lasted more than 3 days and up to 7 to 10 days. State v. Royster, 2d Dist. No. 25870, 2015-Ohio-3608, ¶ 30-31; In re Horton, 10th Dist. No. 03AP-1181, 2004-Ohio-6249, ¶ 27; State v. Krull, 154 Ohio App.3d 219, 2003-Ohio-4611, ¶ 20-23 (12th Dist.); State v. Burdine-Justice, 125 Ohio App.3d 707, 714-715, 709 N.E.2d 551 (12th Dist.1998). Admittedly, those cases are different from the case at hand in the type of injury sustained. Also, in some of the cases a belt was used instead of a paddle board. However, the abrasion caused by the paddling lasted over two weeks and there is testimony it caused the victim pain over an extended period of time. Furthermore, as the Twelfth Appellate District stated, “The force necessary to create such bruising must have been great, and was not accidental on the part of the perpetrator. Clearly, this amount of corporal punishment was unnecessary and unwarranted.” Burdine-Justice, 125 Ohio App.3d at 715. Consequently, although the cases upholding conviction vary from the one before us, the reasoning and the evidence presented in this case indicate they are more akin to the case sub judice than the ones cited by Appellant. This court concludes there was sufficient evidence of excessive corporal punishment, serious physical harm, and substantial risk of serious physical harm.

(2) If the offender violates division (A) or (B)(1) of this section, endangering children is one of the following, and, in the circumstances described in division (E)(2)(e) of this section, that division applies: *** (c) If the violation is a violation of division (A) of this section and results in serious physical harm to the child involved, a felony of the third degree. R.C. 2919.22(A)(E)(1)(2)(c). The felonious assault and both child endangering crimes have a common element – to have caused serious physical harm. Second degree felony child endangering also requires a substantial risk of serious physical harm and excessive corporal punishment. These are the elements Appellant focuses on in this assignment of error. He asserts the paddling was not excessive. He contends there was no evidence that paddling a fully clothed child created a substantial risk of serious physical harm. He also argues the abrasion on the victim's buttocks does not amount to serious physical harm. The analysis begins with whether there was sufficient evidence produced by the state to show the administration of corporal punishment was excessive under the circumstances. This is an element of the second-degree felony child endangering crime. It is undisputed in this case that the injury was caused by the administering of a paddle board on the victim's clothed buttocks. The victim confirmed this admission. We have previously stated that in corporal discipline cases, the state must prove the corporal discipline was improper in light of all of the surrounding facts and circumstances. State v. Rosa, 7th Dist. No. 12 MA 60, 2013-Ohio-5867, 6 N.E.3d 57, ¶ 41. The factors to be considered are: (1) the child's age; (2) the child's behavior leading up to the discipline; (3) the child's response to prior non-corporal punishment; (4) the location and severity of the punishment; and (5) the parent's state of mind while administering the punishment. Id., quoting State v. Luke, 3d Dist. No. 14-10-26, 2011-Ohio-4330, ¶ 23; State v. Hart, 110 Ohio App.3d 250, 255–56, 673 N.E.2d 992 (3d Dist.1996) (“The propriety and reasonableness of corporal punishment in each case must be judged in light of the totality of the circumstances.”). In the case at hand, the victim was 11 years old. The victim was not correctly completing a math problem and this led to the paddling; Appellant admitted the victim was not a behavioral problem. Trial Tr. 322, 324. Appellant testified he used fear and discipline to get his students to focus. Trial Tr. 320. Appellant testified he gave the victim the opportunity to get the math problems correct, but the victim would not carry the digit correctly and kept getting the problems wrong. Trial Tr. 325. Testimony indicated Appellant yelled and scared his students prior to paddling them. Trial Tr. 284; 320. It is undisputed the victim was paddled on his clothed buttocks five times during one tutoring session. Trial Tr. 326. The victim’s aunt, who was the first person the victim showed the injury, described it as follows: It was – his skin was reddish and purplish and it had a scab. You could see like the where the pores of his skin was so open that they were bleeding, you know, it was bleeding out, and it was like holes. You could actually see holes in it. And I asked him, I said, does it hurt? He said, yes, it hurts to sit and everything. So I put gauze, and I put Neosporin on it, and I bandaged it up and tried to cushion it as much as possible. But I had to – I sent a text to his mom and showed her the picture. Trial Tr. 216. Dr. John Melville from the CAC testified at trial. Trial Tr. 241-242. He saw the victim the day after the injury was shown to the aunt. He described the injury as a crescent shaped abrasion about 6cm by 1cm. Trial Tr. 255. It was dark red and there was evidence of some healing. Trial Tr. 255. At the two week follow up visit there was evidence of healing, but the injury was not gone. Trial Tr. 256-257. After one month of healing, the doctor testified there was further healing but the mark was still present. Trial Tr. 257. Pictures taken at the CAC were admitted into evidence. Trial Tr. 254; State’s Exhibit 2-5. Appellant testified he did not want to hurt the victim. Trial Tr. 328. He explained he taught in a fear induced learning environment. Trial Tr. 320. He stated it was “like an exorcism” to get the victim to carry the number correctly in doing a three digit math problem. Trial Tr. 325. Considering these facts in the light most favorable to the prosecution the punishment was improper and excessive. As to the felonious assault and third-degree felony child endangering convictions, the question is whether there was serious physical harm to the child. As there was sufficient evidence of excessive corporal punishment, the analysis for the second-degree felony child endangering conviction is whether there was a substantial risk of serious physical harm to the child. “Serious physical harm to persons” is defined as: (a) Any mental illness or condition of such gravity as would normally require hospitalization or prolonged psychiatric treatment; (b) Any physical harm that carries a substantial risk of death; (c) Any physical harm that involves some permanent incapacity, whether partial or total, or that involves some temporary, substantial incapacity; (d) Any physical harm that involves some permanent disfigurement or that involves some temporary, serious disfigurement; (e) Any physical harm that involves acute pain of such duration as to result in substantial suffering or that involves any degree of prolonged or intractable pain. R.C. 2901.01(A)(5). “Substantial risk” is defined as “a strong possibility, as contrasted with a remote or significant possibility, that a certain result may occur or that certain circumstances may exist.” R.C. 2901.01(A)(8). Appellant cites this court to a case where the appellate court found there was not sufficient evidence of serious physical harm or substantial risk of serious physical harm. He contends the cases cited by him are examples of worse conduct by an offender and the appellate court found there was not sufficient evidence of the crimes. Three of the cases - Ivey, Wright, and Enovitch - are from the Eighth Appellate District and are from the mid to late 1990s. In Ivey, the child had welts and bruises on his buttocks and legs from being beat with a belt for disciplinary reasons. State v. Ivey, 98 Ohio App.3d 249, 648 N.E.2d 519 (8th Dist.1994). In reversing the conviction, the Eighth Appellate District court stated: Although the punishment may have been excessive, the state produced no evidence that the bruises and welts caused by the strapping resulted in serious physical harm or created a substantial risk of serious physical harm. On the contrary, the evidence showed the boy went to school, without incident, the next day. There was no evidence he was in great pain or that he had trouble sitting or walking. The treating physician did not find it necessary to hospitalize the boy, order any type of pain killer (even aspirin), or to schedule another medical exam to check on his progress. The evidence presented in the record shows the injuries sustained by the child were the result of the imposition of corporal punishment by a father who judged his son's school conduct and acts of deception warranted a strong physical disciplinary response. The state failed to prove by sufficient evidence that this type of whipping resulted in serious physical harm or could result in a substantial risk of serious physical harm to the child. Id. at 524. Similarly in the other two Eighth Appellate District cases the court found there was not sufficient evidence of serious physical harm. City of Shaker Hts. v. Wright, 8th Dist. No. 69517, 1996 WL 355309 (June 27, 1996); State v. Enovitch, 8th Dist. No. 72827, 1998 WL 518163 (Aug. 20, 1998). Wright was a child endangering case and in that case the court explained: This conclusion, that the element of seriousness was lacking, is buttressed by the following: (1) the marks were small and were receding over time; (2) the emergency room physician testified that he thought that there was no scarring at the site of the marks and did not feel there had been any abuse; (3) the emergency room report identified the marks as bruises or contusions, not scars; (4) while the injury site was sore the evening it was inflicted, the injury did not prevent the boy from sleeping and the victim experienced no pain at the site of the injury the morning after the injury was inflicted and thereafter enjoyed his normal activities without pain or difficulty; (5) the injury required no follow-up medical care or physical therapy; and, (6) the treating physician did not hospitalize the boy. Accordingly, the City failed to prove by sufficient evidence that this type of whipping resulted in serious physical harm or could result in a substantial risk of serious physical harm to the child. Wright, 8th Dist. No. 69517. Enovitch was a felonious assault case and in that case the court explained: Other than Gartman's statement, there was no evidence at trial that the scar above his eye was permanent. There is no evidence as to who told him the scar would not go away or that the person was qualified to make such a determination. The hospital records described his injury as just over 1.5 centimeters in length and as a “burst-type injury, clean, shallow, not particularly jagged.” The hospital discharge instructions characterized the injury as “minor.” Based upon the evidence presented, we conclude that Gartman's injury did not constitute the serious physical harm required for a felonious assault conviction. Accordingly, Enovitch's second assignment of error is well taken. Enovitch, 8th Dist. No. 72827. Appellant also cites In re L.J., 176 Ohio App.3d 186, 2008-Ohio-1488, 891 N.E.2d 778 (3d Dist.). In that case, the appellate court found the trial court erred as a matter of law when it concluded the child was “abused” under R.C. 2151.031(C) because of corporal punishment. Id. at ¶ 45. The appellate court explained the evidence was insufficient to show the corporal punishment was excessive and to show that it created a substantial risk of serious physical harm: While we certainly share the trial court's sentiment that striking a child with a belt on back of the legs supports a finding that the punishment was excessive, this court has stated that corporal punishment on parts of the body other than the buttocks may be proper and reasonable. Hart, 110 Ohio App.3d at 255, 673 N.E.2d 992. In addition, Skinner testified that she had intended to strike J.L. on the butt; however, J.L. moved, which is why she missed. As to the severity, the marks were red but also appeared to be fading and healing within three to four days after the incident, which indicates that the discipline may not have been excessive. Skinner also testified that she did not observe bruises on J.L. after the incident. The record lacks any medical evidence, which would lead one to conclude that the discipline was excessive. No physician testified at the hearing, nor was any medical report admitted into evidence showing that J.L. required medical attention as a result of the discipline. In fact, on the day the caseworker discovered the bruises, J.L. was outside playing with his brother. * * * We also cannot conclude that the punishment created a substantial risk of serious physical harm as those terms are defined. The evidence presented consisted of Core’s testimony and the photographs, which, for the most part, revealed that J.L. was bruised. Our review of the admitted photographic evidence confirms that J.L. was bruised, but bruising alone is not sufficient to constitute serious physical harm. In re Schuerman, 74 Ohio App.3d at 532, 599 N.E.2d 728 (trial court could reasonably infer that severe bruising on the buttocks, thighs, and ankles from punishment that was inflicted multiple times for the same misbehavior with a wooden paddle or belt on an eight-year-old girl created a substantial risk of serious physical harm). Other courts have found that punishment much more severe than J.L.’s did not constitute serious physical harm. See, e.g., Ivey, 98 Ohio App.3d at 255–256, 648 N.E.2d 519 (bruised left eyelid, bruises, welts, and lacerations caused by a belt whipping on the buttocks and lower legs and a swollen hand was not “serious physical harm”). Again, notably missing from the record is any medical evidence or reports to show that J.L.’s injuries amounted to serious physical harm. On the basis of this record, we cannot conclude that the corporal punishment caused a substantial risk of serious physical harm. Id. at ¶ 41, 44. Appellant also cites a biting case where the parents used biting as a means to punish a nine year old child who bit his brother. In re Miles, 9th Dist. No. 01CA0054, 2002-Ohio-2438. In finding insufficient evidence of serious physical harm, the appellate court explained: Additionally, appellee argues that the bruising is an indication of serious physical harm. In this case, the alleged serious physical harm was “any physical harm that involves acute pain of such duration as to result in substantial suffering, or that involves any degree of prolonged or intractable pain.” See R.C. 2901.01(A)(5)(e). However, the record does not contain any evidence that acute pain resulted of any lasting duration to result in substantial suffering, or that it lasted for an extended period of time or was intractable. Although this act may be inappropriate and unwarranted, it did not rise to the level of being an offense of child abuse. Id. at ¶ 12-13. These cases are distinguishable from the case at hand; in this case there is evidence of treatment, pain caused from the paddling that lasted over a period of time, and medical testimony from the treating doctor. In all of the cases cited by Appellant the court notes the lack of evidence. However, there is evidence in this case. The victim’s mother testified it took the wound on the victim’s buttocks over two weeks to heal. Trial Tr. 183. The child victim testified it hurt when the Appellant hit him with the paddle board. Trial Tr. 202. As stated above the victim’s aunt described the injury as open, bleeding, and scabby. Trial Tr. 216. The victim told her it “hurt to sit and everything.” Trial Tr. 216. The picture the aunt took was shown to the jury. Trial Tr. 216; State’s Exhibit 1. Dr. John Melville from the CAC, whose entire professional career is devoted to child abuse pediatrics, indicated that at a two week follow-up visit, there was evidence of healing but the injury was not gone. Trial Tr. 245, 256-257. After one month of healing, the doctor testified there was further healing but the mark was still present. Trial Tr. 257. Pictures taken at the CAC were admitted into evidence. Trial Tr. 254; State’s Exhibit 2-5. The doctor was asked what are reasonable physical disciplinary measures. Trial Tr. 260. He explained nobody is opposed to physical discipline in general, but if it is to be administered then it is recommended to be hand to buttocks and that it not leave any marks that would persist for more than 4 to 5 minutes. Trial Tr. Based on what he observed in this case he opined that the victim's injury was the result of unreasonable physical discipline. Trial Tr. 261. In determining whether admittedly excessive corporal punishment caused substantial risk of serious physical harm to the child, the Fourth Appellate District has explained: “Discipline methods on a child which leave recognizable bruising and cause pain which lasts beyond the time immediately following an altercation between parent and the child may establish a finding of substantial risk of serious harm.” In re Kristen V., 6th Dist. Ottawa No. OT–07–031, 2008–Ohio–2994, ¶ 69. Bruising alone, however, is not sufficient to show that the discipline method created a substantial risk of serious physical harm. Schuerman, 74 Ohio App.3d at 532 (stating that “bruising alone is insufficient to establish abuse”). State v. Neal, 4th Dist. Nos. 14CA31, 14CA32, 2015-Ohio-5452, ¶ 45. Considering the testimony and viewing it in the light most favorable to the state, there was sufficient evidence of serious physical harm and substantial risk of serious physical harm. We note the state cites this court to cases upholding child endangering convictions where the victim had extensive bruising on the buttocks, legs and back and where that bruising lasted more than 3 days and up to 7 to 10 days. State v. Royster, 2d Dist. No. 25870, 2015-Ohio-3608, ¶ 30-31; In re Horton, 10th Dist. No. 03AP-1181, 2004-Ohio-6249, ¶ 27; State v. Krull, 154 Ohio App.3d 219, 2003-Ohio-4611, ¶ 20-23 (12th Dist.); State v. Burdine-Justice, 125 Ohio App.3d 707, 714-715, 709 N.E.2d 551 (12th Dist.1998). Admittedly, those cases are different from the case at hand in the type of injury sustained. Also, in some of the cases a belt was used instead of a paddle board. However, the abrasion caused by the paddling lasted over two weeks and there is testimony it caused the victim pain over an extended period of time. Furthermore, as the Twelfth Appellate District stated, “The force necessary to create such bruising must have been great, and was not accidental on the part of the perpetrator. Clearly, this amount of corporal punishment was unnecessary and unwarranted.” Burdine-Justice, 125 Ohio App.3d at 715. Consequently, although the cases upholding conviction vary from the one before us, the reasoning and the evidence presented in this case indicate they are more akin to the case sub judice than the ones cited by Appellant. This court concludes there was sufficient evidence of excessive corporal punishment, serious physical harm, and substantial risk of serious physical harm. This assignment of error is meritless.\"\n}\n```"}

The portion of the felonious assault statute he was found guilty of violating states: (A) No person shall knowingly do either of the following: (1) Cause serious physical harm to another or to another's unborn; (D)(1)(a) Whoever violates this section is guilty of felonious assault. Except as otherwise provided in this division or division (D)(1)(b) of this section, felonious assault is a felony of the second degree. R.C. 2903.11(A)(1)(D). Appellant was found guilty of second-degree felony child endangering defined as: (B) No person shall do any of the following to a child under eighteen years of age or a mentally or physically handicapped child under twenty-one years of age: *** (3) Administer corporal punishment or other physical disciplinary measure, or physically restrain the child in a cruel manner or for a prolonged period, which punishment, discipline, or restraint is excessive under the circumstances and creates a substantial risk of serious physical harm to the child; *** (E)(1) Whoever violates this section is guilty of endangering children. *** (3) If the offender violates division (B)(2), (3), (4), or (6) of this section, except as otherwise provided in this division, endangering children is a felony of the third degree. If the violation results in serious physical harm to the child involved, or if the offender previously has been convicted of an offense under this section or of any offense involving neglect, abandonment, contributing to the delinquency of, or physical abuse of a child, endangering children is a felony of the second degree. R.C. 2919.22(B)(3)(E)(1)(3). Appellant was found to have caused serious physical harm under this statute. Appellant was also found guilty of third-degree felony child endangering as defined as: (A) No person, who is the parent, guardian, custodian, person having custody or control, or person in loco parentis of a child under eighteen years of age or a mentally or physically handicapped child under twenty-one years of age, shall create a substantial risk to the health or safety of the child, by violating a duty of care, protection, or support.

R.C. 2919.22(A)(E)(1)(2)(c). The felonious assault and both child endangering crimes have a common element – to have caused serious physical harm. Second degree felony child endangering also requires a substantial risk of serious physical harm and excessive corporal punishment. These are the elements Appellant focuses on in this assignment of error. He asserts the paddling was not excessive. He contends there was no evidence that paddling a fully clothed child created a substantial risk of serious physical harm. He also argues the abrasion on the victim's buttocks does not amount to serious physical harm.

Id., quoting State v. Luke, 3d Dist. No. 14-10-26, 2011-Ohio-4330, ¶ 23; State v.

In the case at hand, the victim was 11 years old. The victim was not correctly completing a math problem and this led to the paddling; Appellant admitted the victim was not a behavioral problem.

Considering these facts in the light most favorable to the prosecution the punishment was improper and excessive. As to the felonious assault and third-degree felony child endangering convictions, the question is whether there was serious physical harm to the child. As there was sufficient evidence of excessive corporal punishment, the analysis for the second-degree felony child endangering conviction is whether there was a substantial risk of serious physical harm to the child. “Serious physical harm to persons” is defined as: (a) Any mental illness or condition of such gravity as would normally require hospitalization or prolonged psychiatric treatment; (b) Any physical harm that carries a substantial risk of death; (c) Any physical harm that involves some permanent incapacity, whether partial or total, or that involves some temporary, substantial incapacity; (d) Any physical harm that involves some permanent disfigurement or that involves some temporary, serious disfigurement; (e) Any physical harm that involves acute pain of such duration as to result in substantial suffering or that involves any degree of prolonged or intractable pain. R.C. 2901.01(A)(5). “Substantial risk” is defined as “a strong possibility, as contrasted with a remote or significant possibility, that a certain result may occur or that certain circumstances may exist.” R.C. 2901.01(A)(8). Appellant cites this court to a case where the appellate court found there was not sufficient evidence of serious physical harm or substantial risk of serious physical harm. He contends the cases cited by him are examples of worse conduct by an offender and the appellate court found there was not sufficient evidence of the crimes. Three of the cases - Ivey, Wright, and Enovitch - are from the Eighth Appellate District and are from the mid to late 1990s. In Ivey, the child had welts and bruises on his buttocks and legs from being beat with a belt for disciplinary reasons. State v. Ivey, 98 Ohio App.3d 249, 648 N.E.2d 519 (8th Dist.1994). In reversing the conviction, the Eighth Appellate District court stated: Although the punishment may have been excessive, the state produced no evidence that the bruises and welts caused by the strapping resulted in serious physical harm or created a substantial risk of serious physical harm. On the contrary, the evidence showed the boy went to school, without incident, the next day. There was no evidence he was in great pain or that he had trouble sitting or walking. The treating physician did not find it necessary to hospitalize the boy, order any type of pain killer (even aspirin), or to schedule another medical exam to check on his progress. The evidence presented in the record shows the injuries sustained by the child were the result of the imposition of corporal punishment by a father who judged his son's school conduct and acts of deception warranted a strong physical disciplinary response. The state failed to prove by sufficient evidence that this type of whipping resulted in serious physical harm or could result in a substantial risk of serious physical harm to the child. Id. at 524. Similarly in the other two Eighth Appellate District cases the court found there was not sufficient evidence of serious physical harm. City of Shaker Hts. v. Wright, 8th Dist. No. 69517, 1996 WL 355309 (June 27, 1996); State v. Enovitch, 8th Dist. No. 72827, 1998 WL 518163 (Aug. 20, 1998). Wright was a child endangering case and in that case the court explained: This conclusion, that the element of seriousness was lacking, is buttressed by the following: (1) the marks were small and were receding over time; (2) the emergency room physician testified that he thought that there was no scarring at the site of the marks and did not feel there had been any abuse; (3) the emergency room report identified the marks as bruises or contusions, not scars; (4) while the injury site was sore the evening it was inflicted, the injury did not prevent the boy from sleeping and the victim experienced no pain at the site of the injury the morning after the injury was inflicted and thereafter enjoyed his normal activities without pain or difficulty; (5) the injury required no follow-up medical care or physical therapy; and, (6) the treating physician did not hospitalize the boy. Accordingly, the City failed to prove by sufficient evidence that this type of whipping resulted in serious physical harm or could result in a substantial risk of serious physical harm to the child. Wright, 8th Dist. No. 69517. Enovitch was a felonious assault case and in that case the court explained: Other than Gartman's statement, there was no evidence at trial that the scar above his eye was permanent. There is no evidence as to who told him the scar would not go away or that the person was qualified to make such a determination. The hospital records described his injury as just over 1.5 centimeters in length and as a “burst-type injury, clean, shallow, not particularly jagged.” The hospital discharge instructions characterized the injury as “minor.” Based upon the evidence presented, we conclude that Gartman's injury did not constitute the serious physical harm required for a felonious assault conviction. Accordingly, Enovitch's second assignment of error is well taken. Enovitch, 8th Dist. No. 72827. Appellant also cites In re L.J., 176 Ohio App.3d 186, 2008-Ohio-1488, 891 N.E.2d 778 (3d Dist.). In that case, the appellate court found the trial court erred as a matter of law when it concluded the child was “abused” under R.C. 2151.031(C) because of corporal punishment. Id. at ¶ 45. The appellate court explained the evidence was insufficient to show the corporal punishment was excessive and to show that it created a substantial risk of serious physical harm: While we certainly share the trial court's sentiment that striking a child with a belt on back of the legs supports a finding that the punishment was excessive, this court has stated that corporal punishment on parts of the body other than the buttocks may be proper and reasonable. Hart, 110 Ohio App.3d at 255, 673 N.E.2d 992. In addition, Skinner testified that she had intended to strike J.L. on the butt; however, J.L. moved, which is why she missed. As to the severity, the marks were red but also appeared to be fading and healing within three to four days after the incident, which indicates that the discipline may not have been excessive. Skinner also testified that she did not observe bruises on J.L. after the incident. The record lacks any medical evidence, which would lead one to conclude that the discipline was excessive.

Our review of the admitted photographic evidence confirms that J.L. was bruised, but bruising alone is not sufficient to constitute serious physical harm. In re Schuerman, 74 Ohio App.3d at 532, 599 N.E.2d 728 (trial court could reasonably infer that severe bruising on the buttocks, thighs, and ankles from punishment that was inflicted multiple times for the same misbehavior with a wooden paddle or belt on an eight-year-old girl created a substantial risk of serious physical harm). Other courts have found that punishment much more severe than J.L.’s did not constitute serious physical harm. See, e.g., Ivey, 98 Ohio App.3d at 255–256, 648 N.E.2d 519 (bruised left eyelid, bruises, welts, and lacerations caused by a belt whipping on the buttocks and lower legs and a swollen hand was not “serious physical harm”). Again, notably missing from the record is any medical evidence or reports to show that J.L.’s injuries amounted to serious physical harm. On the basis of this record, we cannot conclude that the corporal punishment caused a substantial risk of serious physical harm. Id. at ¶ 41, 44. Appellant also cites a biting case where the parents used biting as a means to punish a nine year old child who bit his brother. In re Miles, 9th Dist. No. 01CA0054, 2002-Ohio-2438. In finding insufficient evidence of serious physical harm, the appellate court explained: Additionally, appellee argues that the bruising is an indication of serious physical harm. In this case, the alleged serious physical harm was “any physical harm that involves acute pain of such duration as to result in substantial suffering, or that involves any degree of prolonged or intractable pain.” See R.C. 2901.01(A)(5)(e). However, the record does not contain any evidence that acute pain resulted of any lasting duration to result in substantial suffering, or that it lasted for an extended period of time or was intractable. Although this act may be inappropriate and unwarranted, it did not rise to the level of being an offense of child abuse. Id. at ¶ 12-13. These cases are distinguishable from the case at hand; in this case there is evidence of treatment, pain caused from the paddling that lasted over a period of time, and medical testimony from the treating doctor. In all of the cases cited by Appellant the court notes the lack of evidence. However, there is evidence in this case. The victim’s mother testified it took the wound on the victim’s buttocks over two weeks to heal. Trial Tr. 183. The child victim testified it hurt when the Appellant hit him with the paddle board. Trial Tr. 202. As stated above the victim’s aunt described the injury as open, bleeding, and scabby. Trial Tr. 216. The victim told her it “hurt to sit and everything.” Trial Tr. 216. The picture the aunt took was shown to the jury. Trial Tr. 216; State’s Exhibit 1. Dr. John Melville from the CAC, whose entire professional career is devoted to child abuse pediatrics, indicated that at a two week follow-up visit, there was evidence of healing but the injury was not gone. Trial Tr. 245, 256-257. After one month of healing, the doctor testified there was further healing but the mark was still present. Trial Tr. 257. Pictures taken at the CAC were admitted into evidence. Trial Tr. 254; State’s Exhibit 2-5. The doctor was asked what are reasonable physical disciplinary measures. Trial Tr. 260. He explained nobody is opposed to physical discipline in general, but if it is to be administered then it is recommended to be hand to buttocks and that it not leave any marks that would persist for more than 4 to 5 minutes. Trial Tr. Based on what he observed in this case he opined that the victim's injury was the result of unreasonable physical discipline. Trial Tr. 261. In determining whether admittedly excessive corporal punishment caused substantial risk of serious physical harm to the child, the Fourth Appellate District has explained: “Discipline methods on a child which leave recognizable bruising and cause pain which lasts beyond the time immediately following an altercation between parent and the child may establish a finding of substantial risk of serious harm.” In re Kristen V., 6th Dist. Ottawa No. OT–07–031, 2008–Ohio–2994, ¶ 69. Bruising alone, however, is not sufficient to show that the discipline method created a substantial risk of serious physical harm. Schuerman, 74 Ohio App.3d at 532 (stating that “bruising alone is insufficient to establish abuse”). State v. Neal, 4th Dist. Nos. 14CA31, 14CA32, 2015-Ohio-5452, ¶ 45. Considering the testimony and viewing it in the light most favorable to the state, there was sufficient evidence of serious physical harm and substantial risk of serious physical harm. We note the state cites this court to cases upholding child endangering convictions where the victim had extensive bruising on the buttocks, legs and back and where that bruising lasted more than 3 days and up to 7 to 10 days. State v. Royster, 2d Dist. No. 25870, 2015-Ohio-3608, ¶ 30-31; In re Horton, 10th Dist. No. 03AP-1181, 2004-Ohio-6249, ¶ 27; State v. Krull, 154 Ohio App.3d 219, 2003-Ohio-4611, ¶ 20-23 (12th Dist.); State v. Burdine-Justice, 125 Ohio App.3d 707, 714-715, 709 N.E.2d 551 (12th Dist.1998). Admittedly, those cases are different from the case at hand in the type of injury sustained. Also, in some of the cases a belt was used instead of a paddle board. However, the abrasion caused by the paddling lasted over two weeks and there is testimony it caused the victim pain over an extended period of time. Furthermore, as the Twelfth Appellate District stated, “The force necessary to create such bruising must have been great, and was not accidental on the part of the perpetrator. Clearly, this amount of corporal punishment was unnecessary and unwarranted.” Burdine-Justice, 125 Ohio App.3d at 715. Consequently, although the cases upholding conviction vary from the one before us, the reasoning and the evidence presented in this case indicate they are more akin to the case sub judice than the ones cited by Appellant. This court concludes there was sufficient evidence of excessive corporal punishment, serious physical harm, and substantial risk of serious physical harm. This assignment of error is meritless.\"\n}\n```"}

Except as otherwise provided in this division or division (D)(1)(b) of this section, felonious assault is a felony of the second degree. R.C. 2903.11(A)(1)(D). Appellant was found guilty of second-degree felony child endangering defined as: (B) No person shall do any of the following to a child under eighteen years of age or a mentally or physically handicapped child under twenty-one years of age: *** (3) Administer corporal punishment or other physical disciplinary measure, or physically restrain the child in a cruel manner or for a prolonged period, which punishment, discipline, or restraint is excessive under the circumstances and creates a substantial risk of serious physical harm to the child; *** (E)(1) Whoever violates this section is guilty of endangering children. *** (3) If the offender violates division (B)(2), (3), (4), or (6) of this section, except as otherwise provided in this division, endangering children is a felony of the third degree.

R.C. 2919.22(B)(3)(E)(1)(3). Appellant was found to have caused serious physical harm under this statute. Appellant was also found guilty of third-degree felony child endangering as defined as: (A) No person, who is the parent, guardian, custodian, person having custody or control, or person in loco parentis of a child under eighteen years of age or a mentally or physically handicapped child under twenty-one years of age, shall create a substantial risk to the health or safety of the child, by violating a duty of care, protection, or support. It is not a violation of a duty of care, protection, or support under this division when the parent, guardian, custodian, or person having custody or control of a child treats the physical or mental illness or defect of the child by spiritual means through prayer alone, in accordance with the tenets of a recognized religious body. *** (E)(1) Whoever violates this section is guilty of endangering children.

R.C. 2919.22(A)(E)(1)(2)(c). The felonious assault and both child endangering crimes have a common element – to have caused serious physical harm. Second degree felony child endangering also requires a substantial risk of serious physical harm and excessive corporal punishment. These are the elements Appellant focuses on in this assignment of error. He asserts the paddling was not excessive. He contends there was no evidence that paddling a fully clothed child created a substantial risk of serious physical harm. He also argues the abrasion on the victim's buttocks does not amount to serious physical harm. The analysis begins with whether there was sufficient evidence produced by the state to show the administration of corporal punishment was excessive under the circumstances. This is an element of the second-degree felony child endangering crime. It is undisputed in this case that the injury was caused by the administering of a paddle board on the victim's clothed buttocks. The victim confirmed this admission. We have previously stated that in corporal discipline cases, the state must prove the corporal discipline was improper in light of all of the surrounding facts and circumstances. State v. Rosa, 7th Dist. No. 12 MA 60, 2013-Ohio-5867, 6 N.E.3d 57, ¶ 41. The factors to be considered are: (1) the child's age; (2) the child's behavior leading up to the discipline; (3) the child's response to prior non-corporal punishment; (4) the location and severity of the punishment; and (5) the parent's state of mind while administering the punishment. Id., quoting State v. Luke, 3d Dist. No. 14-10-26, 2011-Ohio-4330, ¶ 23; State v. Hart, 110 Ohio App.3d 250, 255–56, 673 N.E.2d 992 (3d Dist.1996) (“The propriety and reasonableness of corporal punishment in each case must be judged in light of the totality of the circumstances.”). In the case at hand, the victim was 11 years old. The victim was not correctly completing a math problem and this led to the paddling; Appellant admitted the victim was not a behavioral problem. Trial Tr. 322, 324. Appellant testified he used fear and discipline to get his students to focus. Trial Tr. 320. Appellant testified he gave the victim the opportunity to get the math problems correct, but the victim would not carry the digit correctly and kept getting the problems wrong. Trial Tr. 325. Testimony indicated Appellant yelled and scared his students prior to paddling them. Trial Tr. 284; 320. It is undisputed the victim was paddled on his clothed buttocks five times during one tutoring session. Trial Tr. 326. The victim’s aunt, who was the first person the victim showed the injury, described it as follows: It was – his skin was reddish and purplish and it had a scab. You could see like the where the pores of his skin was so open that they were bleeding, you know, it was bleeding out, and it was like holes. You could actually see holes in it. And I asked him, I said, does it hurt? He said, yes, it hurts to sit and everything. So I put gauze, and I put Neosporin on it, and I bandaged it up and tried to cushion it as much as possible. But I had to – I sent a text to his mom and showed her the picture. Trial Tr. 216. Dr. John Melville from the CAC testified at trial. Trial Tr. 241-242. He saw the victim the day after the injury was shown to the aunt. He described the injury as a crescent shaped abrasion about 6cm by 1cm. Trial Tr. 255. It was dark red and there was evidence of some healing. Trial Tr. 255. At the two week follow up visit there was evidence of healing, but the injury was not gone. Trial Tr. 256-257. After one month of healing, the doctor testified there was further healing but the mark was still present. Trial Tr. 257. Pictures taken at the CAC were admitted into evidence. Trial Tr. 254; State’s Exhibit 2-5. Appellant testified he did not want to hurt the victim. Trial Tr. 328. He explained he taught in a fear induced learning environment. Trial Tr. 320. He stated it was “like an exorcism” to get the victim to carry the number correctly in doing a three digit math problem. Trial Tr. 325. Considering these facts in the light most favorable to the prosecution the punishment was improper and excessive. As to the felonious assault and third-degree felony child endangering convictions, the question is whether there was serious physical harm to the child. As there was sufficient evidence of excessive corporal punishment, the analysis for the second-degree felony child endangering conviction is whether there was a substantial risk of serious physical harm to the child. “Serious physical harm to persons” is defined as: (a) Any mental illness or condition of such gravity as would normally require hospitalization or prolonged psychiatric treatment; (b) Any physical harm that carries a substantial risk of death; (c) Any physical harm that involves some permanent incapacity, whether partial or total, or that involves some temporary, substantial incapacity; (d) Any physical harm that involves some permanent disfigurement or that involves some temporary, serious disfigurement; (e) Any physical harm that involves acute pain of such duration as to result in substantial suffering or that involves any degree of prolonged or intractable pain. R.C. 2901.01(A)(5). “Substantial risk” is defined as “a strong possibility, as contrasted with a remote or significant possibility, that a certain result may occur or that certain circumstances may exist.” R.C. 2901.01(A)(8). Appellant cites this court to a case where the appellate court found there was not sufficient evidence of serious physical harm or substantial risk of serious physical harm. He contends the cases cited by him are examples of worse conduct by an offender and the appellate court found there was not sufficient evidence of the crimes. Three of the cases - Ivey, Wright, and Enovitch - are from the Eighth Appellate District and are from the mid to late 1990s. In Ivey, the child had welts and bruises on his buttocks and legs from being beat with a belt for disciplinary reasons. State v. Ivey, 98 Ohio App.3d 249, 648 N.E.2d 519 (8th Dist.1994). In reversing the conviction, the Eighth Appellate District court stated: Although the punishment may have been excessive, the state produced no evidence that the bruises and welts caused by the strapping resulted in serious physical harm or created a substantial risk of serious physical harm. On the contrary, the evidence showed the boy went to school, without incident, the next day. There was no evidence he was in great pain or that he had trouble sitting or walking. The treating physician did not find it necessary to hospitalize the boy, order any type of pain killer (even aspirin), or to schedule another medical exam to check on his progress. The evidence presented in the record shows the injuries sustained by the child were the result of the imposition of corporal punishment by a father who judged his son's school conduct and acts of deception warranted a strong physical disciplinary response. The state failed to prove by sufficient evidence that this type of whipping resulted in serious physical harm or could result in a substantial risk of serious physical harm to the child. Id. at 524. Similarly in the other two Eighth Appellate District cases the court found there was not sufficient evidence of serious physical harm. City of Shaker Hts. v. Wright, 8th Dist. No. 69517, 1996 WL 355309 (June 27, 1996); State v. Enovitch, 8th Dist. No. 72827, 1998 WL 518163 (Aug. 20, 1998). Wright was a child endangering case and in that case the court explained: This conclusion, that the element of seriousness was lacking, is buttressed by the following: (1) the marks were small and were receding over time; (2) the emergency room physician testified that he thought that there was no scarring at the site of the marks and did not feel there had been any abuse; (3) the emergency room report identified the marks as bruises or contusions, not scars; (4) while the injury site was sore the evening it was inflicted, the injury did not prevent the boy from sleeping and the victim experienced no pain at the site of the injury the morning after the injury was inflicted and thereafter enjoyed his normal activities without pain or difficulty; (5) the injury required no follow-up medical care or physical therapy; and, (6) the treating physician did not hospitalize the boy. Accordingly, the City failed to prove by sufficient evidence that this type of whipping resulted in serious physical harm or could result in a substantial risk of serious physical harm to the child. Wright, 8th Dist. No. 69517. Enovitch was a felonious assault case and in that case the court explained: Other than Gartman's statement, there was no evidence at trial that the scar above his eye was permanent. There is no evidence as to who told him the scar would not go away or that the person was qualified to make such a determination. The hospital records described his injury as just over 1.5 centimeters in length and as a “burst-type injury, clean, shallow, not particularly jagged.” The hospital discharge instructions characterized the injury as “minor.” Based upon the evidence presented, we conclude that Gartman's injury did not constitute the serious physical harm required for a felonious assault conviction. Accordingly, Enovitch's second assignment of error is well taken. Enovitch, 8th Dist. No. 72827. Appellant also cites In re L.J., 176 Ohio App.3d 186, 2008-Ohio-1488, 891 N.E.2d 778 (3d Dist.). In that case, the appellate court found the trial court erred as a matter of law when it concluded the child was “abused” under R.C. 2151.031(C) because of corporal punishment. Id. at ¶ 45. The appellate court explained the evidence was insufficient to show the corporal punishment was excessive and to show that it created a substantial risk of serious physical harm: While we certainly share the trial court's sentiment that striking a child with a belt on back of the legs supports a finding that the punishment was excessive, this court has stated that corporal punishment on parts of the body other than the buttocks may be proper and reasonable. Hart, 110 Ohio App.3d at 255, 673 N.E.2d 992. In addition, Skinner testified that she had intended to strike J.L. on the butt; however, J.L. moved, which is why she missed. As to the severity, the marks were red but also appeared to be fading and healing within three to four days after the incident, which indicates that the discipline may not have been excessive. Skinner also testified that she did not observe bruises on J.L. after the incident. The record lacks any medical evidence, which would lead one to conclude that the discipline was excessive. No physician testified at the hearing, nor was any medical report admitted into evidence showing that J.L. required medical attention as a result of the discipline. In fact, on the day the caseworker discovered the bruises, J.L. was outside playing with his brother. * * * We also cannot conclude that the punishment created a substantial risk of serious physical harm as those terms are defined. The evidence presented consisted of Core’s testimony and the photographs, which, for the most part, revealed that J.L. was bruised. Our review of the admitted photographic evidence confirms that J.L. was bruised, but bruising alone is not sufficient to constitute serious physical harm. In re Schuerman, 74 Ohio App.3d at 532, 599 N.E.2d 728 (trial court could reasonably infer that severe bruising on the buttocks, thighs, and ankles from punishment that was inflicted multiple times for the same misbehavior with a wooden paddle or belt on an eight-year-old girl created a substantial risk of serious physical harm). Other courts have found that punishment much more severe than J.L.’s did not constitute serious physical harm. See, e.g., Ivey, 98 Ohio App.3d at 255–256, 648 N.E.2d 519 (bruised left eyelid, bruises, welts, and lacerations caused by a belt whipping on the buttocks and lower legs and a swollen hand was not “serious physical harm”). Again, notably missing from the record is any medical evidence or reports to show that J.L.’s injuries amounted to serious physical harm. On the basis of this record, we cannot conclude that the corporal punishment caused a substantial risk of serious physical harm. Id. at ¶ 41, 44. Appellant also cites a biting case where the parents used biting as a means to punish a nine year old child who bit his brother. In re Miles, 9th Dist. No. 01CA0054, 2002-Ohio-2438. In finding insufficient evidence of serious physical harm, the appellate court explained: Additionally, appellee argues that the bruising is an indication of serious physical harm. In this case, the alleged serious physical harm was “any physical harm that involves acute pain of such duration as to result in substantial suffering, or that involves any degree of prolonged or intractable pain.” See R.C. 2901.01(A)(5)(e). However, the record does not contain any evidence that acute pain resulted of any lasting duration to result in substantial suffering, or that it lasted for an extended period of time or was intractable. Although this act may be inappropriate and unwarranted, it did not rise to the level of being an offense of child abuse. Id. at ¶ 12-13. These cases are distinguishable from the case at hand; in this case there is evidence of treatment, pain caused from the paddling that lasted over a period of time, and medical testimony from the treating doctor.

Trial Tr. Based on what he observed in this case he opined that the victim's injury was the result of unreasonable physical discipline. Trial Tr. 261.

Ottawa No. OT–07–031, 2008–Ohio–2994, ¶ 69. Bruising alone, however, is not sufficient to show that the discipline method created a substantial risk of serious physical harm. Schuerman, 74 Ohio App.3d at 532 (stating that “bruising alone is insufficient to establish abuse”). State v. Neal, 4th Dist. Nos. 14CA31, 14CA32, 2015-Ohio-5452, ¶ 45. Considering the testimony and viewing it in the light most favorable to the state, there was sufficient evidence of serious physical harm and substantial risk of serious physical harm. We note the state cites this court to cases upholding child endangering convictions where the victim had extensive bruising on the buttocks, legs and back and where that bruising lasted more than 3 days and up to 7 to 10 days. State v. Royster, 2d Dist. No. 25870, 2015-Ohio-3608, ¶ 30-31; In re Horton, 10th Dist. No. 03AP-1181, 2004-Ohio-6249, ¶ 27; State v. Krull, 154 Ohio App.3d 219, 2003-Ohio-4611, ¶ 20-23 (12th Dist.); State v. Burdine-Justice, 125 Ohio App.3d 707, 714-715, 709 N.E.2d 551 (12th Dist.1998). Admittedly, those cases are different from the case at hand in the type of injury sustained. Also, in some of the cases a belt was used instead of a paddle board. However, the abrasion caused by the paddling lasted over two weeks and there is testimony it caused the victim pain over an extended period of time. Furthermore, as the Twelfth Appellate District stated, “The force necessary to create such bruising must have been great, and was not accidental on the part of the perpetrator.

Consequently, although the cases upholding conviction vary from the one before us, the reasoning and the evidence presented in this case indicate they are more akin to the case sub judice than the ones cited by Appellant. This court concludes there was sufficient evidence of excessive corporal punishment, serious physical harm, and substantial risk of serious physical harm.

In the case at hand, the victim was 11 years old. The victim was not correctly completing a math problem and this led to the paddling; Appellant admitted the victim was not a behavioral problem. Trial Tr. 322, 324. Appellant testified he used fear and discipline to get his students to focus. Trial Tr. 320. Appellant testified he gave the victim the opportunity to get the math problems correct, but the victim would not carry the digit correctly and kept getting the problems wrong. Trial Tr. 325. Testimony indicated Appellant yelled and scared his students prior to paddling them. Trial Tr. 284; 320. It is undisputed the victim was paddled on his clothed buttocks five times during one tutoring session. Trial Tr. 326. The victim’s aunt, who was the first person the victim showed the injury, described it as follows: It was – his skin was reddish and purplish and it had a scab. You could see like the where the pores of his skin was so open that they were bleeding, you know, it was bleeding out, and it was like holes. You could actually see holes in it. And I asked him, I said, does it hurt? He said, yes, it hurts to sit and everything. So I put gauze, and I put Neosporin on it, and I bandaged it up and tried to cushion it as much as possible. But I had to – I sent a text to his mom and showed her the picture. Trial Tr. 216. Dr. John Melville from the CAC testified at trial. Trial Tr. 241-242. He saw the victim the day after the injury was shown to the aunt. He described the injury as a crescent shaped abrasion about 6cm by 1cm. Trial Tr. 255. It was dark red and there was evidence of some healing. Trial Tr. 255. At the two week follow up visit there was evidence of healing, but the injury was not gone. Trial Tr. 256-257. After one month of healing, the doctor testified there was further healing but the mark was still present. Trial Tr. 257. Pictures taken at the CAC were admitted into evidence. Trial Tr. 254; State’s Exhibit 2-5. Appellant testified he did not want to hurt the victim. Trial Tr. 328. He explained he taught in a fear induced learning environment. Trial Tr. 320. He stated it was “like an exorcism” to get the victim to carry the number correctly in doing a three digit math problem. Trial Tr. 325. Considering these facts in the light most favorable to the prosecution the punishment was improper and excessive. As to the felonious assault and third-degree felony child endangering convictions, the question is whether there was serious physical harm to the child. As there was sufficient evidence of excessive corporal punishment, the analysis for the second-degree felony child endangering conviction is whether there was a substantial risk of serious physical harm to the child. “Serious physical harm to persons” is defined as: (a) Any mental illness or condition of such gravity as would normally require hospitalization or prolonged psychiatric treatment; (b) Any physical harm that carries a substantial risk of death; (c) Any physical harm that involves some permanent incapacity, whether partial or total, or that involves some temporary, substantial incapacity; (d) Any physical harm that involves some permanent disfigurement or that involves some temporary, serious disfigurement; (e) Any physical harm that involves acute pain of such duration as to result in substantial suffering or that involves any degree of prolonged or intractable pain. R.C. 2901.01(A)(5). “Substantial risk” is defined as “a strong possibility, as contrasted with a remote or significant possibility, that a certain result may occur or that certain circumstances may exist.” R.C. 2901.01(A)(8). Appellant cites this court to a case where the appellate court found there was not sufficient evidence of serious physical harm or substantial risk of serious physical harm. He contends the cases cited by him are examples of worse conduct by an offender and the appellate court found there was not sufficient evidence of the crimes. Three of the cases - Ivey, Wright, and Enovitch - are from the Eighth Appellate District and are from the mid to late 1990s. In Ivey, the child had welts and bruises on his buttocks and legs from being beat with a belt for disciplinary reasons. State v. Ivey, 98 Ohio App.3d 249, 648 N.E.2d 519 (8th Dist.1994). In reversing the conviction, the Eighth Appellate District court stated: Although the punishment may have been excessive, the state produced no evidence that the bruises and welts caused by the strapping resulted in serious physical harm or created a substantial risk of serious physical harm. On the contrary, the evidence showed the boy went to school, without incident, the next day. There was no evidence he was in great pain or that he had trouble sitting or walking. The treating physician did not find it necessary to hospitalize the boy, order any type of pain killer (even aspirin), or to schedule another medical exam to check on his progress. The evidence presented in the record shows the injuries sustained by the child were the result of the imposition of corporal punishment by a father who judged his son's school conduct and acts of deception warranted a strong physical disciplinary response. The state failed to prove by sufficient evidence that this type of whipping resulted in serious physical harm or could result in a substantial risk of serious physical harm to the child. Id. at 524. Similarly in the other two Eighth Appellate District cases the court found there was not sufficient evidence of serious physical harm. City of Shaker Hts. v. Wright, 8th Dist. No. 69517, 1996 WL 355309 (June 27, 1996); State v. Enovitch, 8th Dist. No. 72827, 1998 WL 518163 (Aug. 20, 1998). Wright was a child endangering case and in that case the court explained: This conclusion, that the element of seriousness was lacking, is buttressed by the following: (1) the marks were small and were receding over time; (2) the emergency room physician testified that he thought that there was no scarring at the site of the marks and did not feel there had been any abuse; (3) the emergency room report identified the marks as bruises or contusions, not scars; (4) while the injury site was sore the evening it was inflicted, the injury did not prevent the boy from sleeping and the victim experienced no pain at the site of the injury the morning after the injury was inflicted and thereafter enjoyed his normal activities without pain or difficulty; (5) the injury required no follow-up medical care or physical therapy; and, (6) the treating physician did not hospitalize the boy. Accordingly, the City failed to prove by sufficient evidence that this type of whipping resulted in serious physical harm or could result in a substantial risk of serious physical harm to the child. Wright, 8th Dist. No. 69517. Enovitch was a felonious assault case and in that case the court explained: Other than Gartman's statement, there was no evidence at trial that the scar above his eye was permanent. There is no evidence as to who told him the scar would not go away or that the person was qualified to make such a determination. The hospital records described his injury as just over 1.5 centimeters in length and as a “burst-type injury, clean, shallow, not particularly jagged.” The hospital discharge instructions characterized the injury as “minor.” Based upon the evidence presented, we conclude that Gartman's injury did not constitute the serious physical harm required for a felonious assault conviction. Accordingly, Enovitch's second assignment of error is well taken. Enovitch, 8th Dist. No. 72827. Appellant also cites In re L.J., 176 Ohio App.3d 186, 2008-Ohio-1488, 891 N.E.2d 778 (3d Dist.). In that case, the appellate court found the trial court erred as a matter of law when it concluded the child was “abused” under R.C. 2151.031(C) because of corporal punishment. Id. at ¶ 45. The appellate court explained the evidence was insufficient to show the corporal punishment was excessive and to show that it created a substantial risk of serious physical harm: While we certainly share the trial court's sentiment that striking a child with a belt on back of the legs supports a finding that the punishment was excessive, this court has stated that corporal punishment on parts of the body other than the buttocks may be proper and reasonable. Hart, 110 Ohio App.3d at 255, 673 N.E.2d 992. In addition, Skinner testified that she had intended to strike J.L. on the butt; however, J.L. moved, which is why she missed. As to the severity, the marks were red but also appeared to be fading and healing within three to four days after the incident, which indicates that the discipline may not have been excessive. Skinner also testified that she did not observe bruises on J.L. after the incident. The record lacks any medical evidence, which would lead one to conclude that the discipline was excessive. No physician testified at the hearing, nor was any medical report admitted into evidence showing that J.L. required medical attention as a result of the discipline. In fact, on the day the caseworker discovered the bruises, J.L. was outside playing with his brother. * * * We also cannot conclude that the punishment created a substantial risk of serious physical harm as those terms are defined. The evidence presented consisted of Core’s testimony and the photographs, which, for the most part, revealed that J.L. was bruised. Our review of the admitted photographic evidence confirms that J.L. was bruised, but bruising alone is not sufficient to constitute serious physical harm. In re Schuerman, 74 Ohio App.3d at 532, 599 N.E.2d 728 (trial court could reasonably infer that severe bruising on the buttocks, thighs, and ankles from punishment that was inflicted multiple times for the same misbehavior with a wooden paddle or belt on an eight-year-old girl created a substantial risk of serious physical harm). Other courts have found that punishment much more severe than J.L.’s did not constitute serious physical harm. See, e.g., Ivey, 98 Ohio App.3d at 255–256, 648 N.E.2d 519 (bruised left eyelid, bruises, welts, and lacerations caused by a belt whipping on the buttocks and lower legs and a swollen hand was not “serious physical harm”). Again, notably missing from the record is any medical evidence or reports to show that J.L.’s injuries amounted to serious physical harm. On the basis of this record, we cannot conclude that the corporal punishment caused a substantial risk of serious physical harm. Id. at ¶ 41, 44. Appellant also cites a biting case where the parents used biting as a means to punish a nine year old child who bit his brother. In re Miles, 9th Dist. No. 01CA0054, 2002-Ohio-2438. In finding insufficient evidence of serious physical harm, the appellate court explained: Additionally, appellee argues that the bruising is an indication of serious physical harm. In this case, the alleged serious physical harm was “any physical harm that involves acute pain of such duration as to result in substantial suffering, or that involves any degree of prolonged or intractable pain.” See R.C. 2901.01(A)(5)(e). However, the record does not contain any evidence that acute pain resulted of any lasting duration to result in substantial suffering, or that it lasted for an extended period of time or was intractable. Although this act may be inappropriate and unwarranted, it did not rise to the level of being an offense of child abuse. Id. at ¶ 12-13. These cases are distinguishable from the case at hand; in this case there is evidence of treatment, pain caused from the paddling that lasted over a period of time, and medical testimony from the treating doctor. In all of the cases cited by Appellant the court notes the lack of evidence. However, there is evidence in this case. The victim’s mother testified it took the wound on the victim’s buttocks over two weeks to heal. Trial Tr. 183. The child victim testified it hurt when the Appellant hit him with the paddle board. Trial Tr. 202. As stated above the victim’s aunt described the injury as open, bleeding, and scabby. Trial Tr. 216. The victim told her it “hurt to sit and everything.” Trial Tr. 216. The picture the aunt took was shown to the jury. Trial Tr. 216; State’s Exhibit 1. Dr. John Melville from the CAC, whose entire professional career is devoted to child abuse pediatrics, indicated that at a two week follow-up visit, there was evidence of healing but the injury was not gone. Trial Tr. 245, 256-257. After one month of healing, the doctor testified there was further healing but the mark was still present. Trial Tr. 257. Pictures taken at the CAC were admitted into evidence. Trial Tr. 254; State’s Exhibit 2-5. The doctor was asked what are reasonable physical disciplinary measures. Trial Tr. 260. He explained nobody is opposed to physical discipline in general, but if it is to be administered then it is recommended to be hand to buttocks and that it not leave any marks that would persist for more than 4 to 5 minutes. Trial Tr. Based on what he observed in this case he opined that the victim's injury was the result of unreasonable physical discipline. Trial Tr. 261. In determining whether admittedly excessive corporal punishment caused substantial risk of serious physical harm to the child, the Fourth Appellate District has explained: “Discipline methods on a child which leave recognizable bruising and cause pain which lasts beyond the time immediately following an altercation between parent and the child may establish a finding of substantial risk of serious harm.” In re Kristen V., 6th Dist. Ottawa No. OT–07–031, 2008–Ohio–2994, ¶ 69. Bruising alone, however, is not sufficient to show that the discipline method created a substantial risk of serious physical harm. Schuerman, 74 Ohio App.3d at 532 (stating that “bruising alone is insufficient to establish abuse”). State v. Neal, 4th Dist. Nos. 14CA31, 14CA32, 2015-Ohio-5452, ¶ 45. Considering the testimony and viewing it in the light most favorable to the state, there was sufficient evidence of serious physical harm and substantial risk of serious physical harm. We note the state cites this court to cases upholding child endangering convictions where the victim had extensive bruising on the buttocks, legs and back and where that bruising lasted more than 3 days and up to 7 to 10 days. State v. Royster, 2d Dist. No. 25870, 2015-Ohio-3608, ¶ 30-31; In re Horton, 10th Dist. No. 03AP-1181, 2004-Ohio-6249, ¶ 27; State v. Krull, 154 Ohio App.3d 219, 2003-Ohio-4611, ¶ 20-23 (12th Dist.); State v. Burdine-Justice, 125 Ohio App.3d 707, 714-715, 709 N.E.2d 551 (12th Dist.1998). Admittedly, those cases are different from the case at hand in the type of injury sustained. Also, in some of the cases a belt was used instead of a paddle board. However, the abrasion caused by the paddling lasted over two weeks and there is testimony it caused the victim pain over an extended period of time. Furthermore, as the Twelfth Appellate District stated, “The force necessary to create such bruising must have been great, and was not accidental on the part of the perpetrator. Clearly, this amount of corporal punishment was unnecessary and unwarranted.” Burdine-Justice, 125 Ohio App.3d at 715. Consequently, although the cases upholding conviction vary from the one before us, the reasoning and the evidence presented in this case indicate they are more akin to the case sub judice than the ones cited by Appellant. This court concludes there was sufficient evidence of excessive corporal punishment, serious physical harm, and substantial risk of serious physical harm. This assignment of error is meritless.\"\n}\n```"}

The portion of the felonious assault statute he was found guilty of violating states: (A) No person shall knowingly do either of the following: (1) Cause serious physical harm to another or to another's unborn; (D)(1)(a) Whoever violates this section is guilty of felonious assault. Except as otherwise provided in this division or division (D)(1)(b) of this section, felonious assault is a felony of the second degree. R.C. 2903.11(A)(1)(D). Appellant was found guilty of second-degree felony child endangering defined as: (B) No person shall do any of the following to a child under eighteen years of age or a mentally or physically handicapped child under twenty-one years of age: *** (3) Administer corporal punishment or other physical disciplinary measure, or physically restrain the child in a cruel manner or for a prolonged period, which punishment, discipline, or restraint is excessive under the circumstances and creates a substantial risk of serious physical harm to the child; *** (E)(1) Whoever violates this section is guilty of endangering children. *** (3) If the offender violates division (B)(2), (3), (4), or (6) of this section, except as otherwise provided in this division, endangering children is a felony of the third degree. If the violation results in serious physical harm to the child involved, or if the offender previously has been convicted of an offense under this section or of any offense involving neglect, abandonment, contributing to the delinquency of, or physical abuse of a child, endangering children is a felony of the second degree. R.C. 2919.22(B)(3)(E)(1)(3). Appellant was found to have caused serious physical harm under this statute. Appellant was also found guilty of third-degree felony child endangering as defined as: (A) No person, who is the parent, guardian, custodian, person having custody or control, or person in loco parentis of a child under eighteen years of age or a mentally or physically handicapped child under twenty-one years of age, shall create a substantial risk to the health or safety of the child, by violating a duty of care, protection, or support. It is not a violation of a duty of care, protection, or support under this division when the parent, guardian, custodian, or person having custody or control of a child treats the physical or mental illness or defect of the child by spiritual means through prayer alone, in accordance with the tenets of a recognized religious body. *** (E)(1) Whoever violates this section is guilty of endangering children. (2) If the offender violates division (A) or (B)(1) of this section, endangering children is one of the following, and, in the circumstances described in division (E)(2)(e) of this section, that division applies: *** (c) If the violation is a violation of division (A) of this section and results in serious physical harm to the child involved, a felony of the third degree. R.C. 2919.22(A)(E)(1)(2)(c). The felonious assault and both child endangering crimes have a common element – to have caused serious physical harm. Second degree felony child endangering also requires a substantial risk of serious physical harm and excessive corporal punishment. These are the elements Appellant focuses on in this assignment of error. He asserts the paddling was not excessive. He contends there was no evidence that paddling a fully clothed child created a substantial risk of serious physical harm. He also argues the abrasion on the victim's buttocks does not amount to serious physical harm. The analysis begins with whether there was sufficient evidence produced by the state to show the administration of corporal punishment was excessive under the circumstances. This is an element of the second-degree felony child endangering crime. It is undisputed in this case that the injury was caused by the administering of a paddle board on the victim's clothed buttocks. The victim confirmed this admission. We have previously stated that in corporal discipline cases, the state must prove the corporal discipline was improper in light of all of the surrounding facts and circumstances. State v. Rosa, 7th Dist. No. 12 MA 60, 2013-Ohio-5867, 6 N.E.3d 57, ¶ 41. The factors to be considered are: (1) the child's age; (2) the child's behavior leading up to the discipline; (3) the child's response to prior non-corporal punishment; (4) the location and severity of the punishment; and (5) the parent's state of mind while administering the punishment. Id., quoting State v. Luke, 3d Dist. No. 14-10-26, 2011-Ohio-4330, ¶ 23; State v. Hart, 110 Ohio App.3d 250, 255–56, 673 N.E.2d 992 (3d Dist.1996) (“The propriety and reasonableness of corporal punishment in each case must be judged in light of the totality of the circumstances.”). In the case at hand, the victim was 11 years old. The victim was not correctly completing a math problem and this led to the paddling; Appellant admitted the victim was not a behavioral problem.

Considering these facts in the light most favorable to the prosecution the punishment was improper and excessive. As to the felonious assault and third-degree felony child endangering convictions, the question is whether there was serious physical harm to the child. As there was sufficient evidence of excessive corporal punishment, the analysis for the second-degree felony child endangering conviction is whether there was a substantial risk of serious physical harm to the child. “Serious physical harm to persons” is defined as: (a) Any mental illness or condition of such gravity as would normally require hospitalization or prolonged psychiatric treatment; (b) Any physical harm that carries a substantial risk of death; (c) Any physical harm that involves some permanent incapacity, whether partial or total, or that involves some temporary, substantial incapacity; (d) Any physical harm that involves some permanent disfigurement or that involves some temporary, serious disfigurement; (e) Any physical harm that involves acute pain of such duration as to result in substantial suffering or that involves any degree of prolonged or intractable pain. R.C. 2901.01(A)(5). “Substantial risk” is defined as “a strong possibility, as contrasted with a remote or significant possibility, that a certain result may occur or that certain circumstances may exist.” R.C. 2901.01(A)(8). Appellant cites this court to a case where the appellate court found there was not sufficient evidence of serious physical harm or substantial risk of serious physical harm. He contends the cases cited by him are examples of worse conduct by an offender and the appellate court found there was not sufficient evidence of the crimes. Three of the cases - Ivey, Wright, and Enovitch - are from the Eighth Appellate District and are from the mid to late 1990s. In Ivey, the child had welts and bruises on his buttocks and legs from being beat with a belt for disciplinary reasons. State v. Ivey, 98 Ohio App.3d 249, 648 N.E.2d 519 (8th Dist.1994). In reversing the conviction, the Eighth Appellate District court stated: Although the punishment may have been excessive, the state produced no evidence that the bruises and welts caused by the strapping resulted in serious physical harm or created a substantial risk of serious physical harm. On the contrary, the evidence showed the boy went to school, without incident, the next day. There was no evidence he was in great pain or that he had trouble sitting or walking. The treating physician did not find it necessary to hospitalize the boy, order any type of pain killer (even aspirin), or to schedule another medical exam to check on his progress. The evidence presented in the record shows the injuries sustained by the child were the result of the imposition of corporal punishment by a father who judged his son's school conduct and acts of deception warranted a strong physical disciplinary response. The state failed to prove by sufficient evidence that this type of whipping resulted in serious physical harm or could result in a substantial risk of serious physical harm to the child. Id. at 524. Similarly in the other two Eighth Appellate District cases the court found there was not sufficient evidence of serious physical harm. City of Shaker Hts. v. Wright, 8th Dist. No. 69517, 1996 WL 355309 (June 27, 1996); State v. Enovitch, 8th Dist. No. 72827, 1998 WL 518163 (Aug. 20, 1998). Wright was a child endangering case and in that case the court explained: This conclusion, that the element of seriousness was lacking, is buttressed by the following: (1) the marks were small and were receding over time; (2) the emergency room physician testified that he thought that there was no scarring at the site of the marks and did not feel there had been any abuse; (3) the emergency room report identified the marks as bruises or contusions, not scars; (4) while the injury site was sore the evening it was inflicted, the injury did not prevent the boy from sleeping and the victim experienced no pain at the site of the injury the morning after the injury was inflicted and thereafter enjoyed his normal activities without pain or difficulty; (5) the injury required no follow-up medical care or physical therapy; and, (6) the treating physician did not hospitalize the boy. Accordingly, the City failed to prove by sufficient evidence that this type of whipping resulted in serious physical harm or could result in a substantial risk of serious physical harm to the child. Wright, 8th Dist. No. 69517. Enovitch was a felonious assault case and in that case the court explained: Other than Gartman's statement, there was no evidence at trial that the scar above his eye was permanent. There is no evidence as to who told him the scar would not go away or that the person was qualified to make such a determination. The hospital records described his injury as just over 1.5 centimeters in length and as a “burst-type injury, clean, shallow, not particularly jagged.” The hospital discharge instructions characterized the injury as “minor.” Based upon the evidence presented, we conclude that Gartman's injury did not constitute the serious physical harm required for a felonious assault conviction. Accordingly, Enovitch's second assignment of error is well taken. Enovitch, 8th Dist. No. 72827. Appellant also cites In re L.J., 176 Ohio App.3d 186, 2008-Ohio-1488, 891 N.E.2d 778 (3d Dist.). In that case, the appellate court found the trial court erred as a matter of law when it concluded the child was “abused” under R.C. 2151.031(C) because of corporal punishment. Id. at ¶ 45. The appellate court explained the evidence was insufficient to show the corporal punishment was excessive and to show that it created a substantial risk of serious physical harm: While we certainly share the trial court's sentiment that striking a child with a belt on back of the legs supports a finding that the punishment was excessive, this court has stated that corporal punishment on parts of the body other than the buttocks may be proper and reasonable. Hart, 110 Ohio App.3d at 255, 673 N.E.2d 992. In addition, Skinner testified that she had intended to strike J.L. on the butt; however, J.L. moved, which is why she missed. As to the severity, the marks were red but also appeared to be fading and healing within three to four days after the incident, which indicates that the discipline may not have been excessive. Skinner also testified that she did not observe bruises on J.L. after the incident. The record lacks any medical evidence, which would lead one to conclude that the discipline was excessive. No physician testified at the hearing, nor was any medical report admitted into evidence showing that J.L. required medical attention as a result of the discipline.

The evidence presented consisted of Core’s testimony and the photographs, which, for the most part, revealed that J.L. was bruised. Our review of the admitted photographic evidence confirms that J.L. was bruised, but bruising alone is not sufficient to constitute serious physical harm. In re Schuerman, 74 Ohio App.3d at 532, 599 N.E.2d 728 (trial court could reasonably infer that severe bruising on the buttocks, thighs, and ankles from punishment that was inflicted multiple times for the same misbehavior with a wooden paddle or belt on an eight-year-old girl created a substantial risk of serious physical harm). Other courts have found that punishment much more severe than J.L.’s did not constitute serious physical harm. See, e.g., Ivey, 98 Ohio App.3d at 255–256, 648 N.E.2d 519 (bruised left eyelid, bruises, welts, and lacerations caused by a belt whipping on the buttocks and lower legs and a swollen hand was not “serious physical harm”). Again, notably missing from the record is any medical evidence or reports to show that J.L.’s injuries amounted to serious physical harm. On the basis of this record, we cannot conclude that the corporal punishment caused a substantial risk of serious physical harm. Id. at ¶ 41, 44. Appellant also cites a biting case where the parents used biting as a means to punish a nine year old child who bit his brother. In re Miles, 9th Dist. No. 01CA0054, 2002-Ohio-2438. In finding insufficient evidence of serious physical harm, the appellate court explained: Additionally, appellee argues that the bruising is an indication of serious physical harm. In this case, the alleged serious physical harm was “any physical harm that involves acute pain of such duration as to result in substantial suffering, or that involves any degree of prolonged or intractable pain.” See R.C. 2901.01(A)(5)(e). However, the record does not contain any evidence that acute pain resulted of any lasting duration to result in substantial suffering, or that it lasted for an extended period of time or was intractable. Although this act may be inappropriate and unwarranted, it did not rise to the level of being an offense of child abuse. Id. at ¶ 12-13. These cases are distinguishable from the case at hand; in this case there is evidence of treatment, pain caused from the paddling that lasted over a period of time, and medical testimony from the treating doctor. In all of the cases cited by Appellant the court notes the lack of evidence. However, there is evidence in this case. The victim’s mother testified it took the wound on the victim’s buttocks over two weeks to heal. Trial Tr. 183. The child victim testified it hurt when the Appellant hit him with the paddle board. Trial Tr. 202. As stated above the victim’s aunt described the injury as open, bleeding, and scabby. Trial Tr. 216. The victim told her it “hurt to sit and everything.” Trial Tr. 216. The picture the aunt took was shown to the jury. Trial Tr. 216; State’s Exhibit 1. Dr. John Melville from the CAC, whose entire professional career is devoted to child abuse pediatrics, indicated that at a two week follow-up visit, there was evidence of healing but the injury was not gone. Trial Tr. 245, 256-257. After one month of healing, the doctor testified there was further healing but the mark was still present. Trial Tr. 257. Pictures taken at the CAC were admitted into evidence. Trial Tr. 254; State’s Exhibit 2-5. The doctor was asked what are reasonable physical disciplinary measures. Trial Tr. 260. He explained nobody is opposed to physical discipline in general, but if it is to be administered then it is recommended to be hand to buttocks and that it not leave any marks that would persist for more than 4 to 5 minutes. Trial Tr. Based on what he observed in this case he opined that the victim's injury was the result of unreasonable physical discipline. Trial Tr. 261. In determining whether admittedly excessive corporal punishment caused substantial risk of serious physical harm to the child, the Fourth Appellate District has explained: “Discipline methods on a child which leave recognizable bruising and cause pain which lasts beyond the time immediately following an altercation between parent and the child may establish a finding of substantial risk of serious harm.” In re Kristen V., 6th Dist. Ottawa No. OT–07–031, 2008–Ohio–2994, ¶ 69. Bruising alone, however, is not sufficient to show that the discipline method created a substantial risk of serious physical harm. Schuerman, 74 Ohio App.3d at 532 (stating that “bruising alone is insufficient to establish abuse”). State v. Neal, 4th Dist. Nos. 14CA31, 14CA32, 2015-Ohio-5452, ¶ 45. Considering the testimony and viewing it in the light most favorable to the state, there was sufficient evidence of serious physical harm and substantial risk of serious physical harm. We note the state cites this court to cases upholding child endangering convictions where the victim had extensive bruising on the buttocks, legs and back and where that bruising lasted more than 3 days and up to 7 to 10 days. State v. Royster, 2d Dist. No. 25870, 2015-Ohio-3608, ¶ 30-31; In re Horton, 10th Dist. No. 03AP-1181, 2004-Ohio-6249, ¶ 27; State v. Krull, 154 Ohio App.3d 219, 2003-Ohio-4611, ¶ 20-23 (12th Dist.); State v. Burdine-Justice, 125 Ohio App.3d 707, 714-715, 709 N.E.2d 551 (12th Dist.1998). Admittedly, those cases are different from the case at hand in the type of injury sustained. Also, in some of the cases a belt was used instead of a paddle board. However, the abrasion caused by the paddling lasted over two weeks and there is testimony it caused the victim pain over an extended period of time. Furthermore, as the Twelfth Appellate District stated, “The force necessary to create such bruising must have been great, and was not accidental on the part of the perpetrator. Clearly, this amount of corporal punishment was unnecessary and unwarranted.” Burdine-Justice, 125 Ohio App.3d at 715. Consequently, although the cases upholding conviction vary from the one before us, the reasoning and the evidence presented in this case indicate they are more akin to the case sub judice than the ones cited by Appellant. This court concludes there was sufficient evidence of excessive corporal punishment, serious physical harm, and substantial risk of serious physical harm. This assignment of error is meritless.\"\n}\n```"}
{"Index": "180-PANEZICH", "allegation_num": "allegation_1", "allegation": "Enforcement of Defendant’s guilty plea in this action is unconstitutional under both the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process clause and the Ohio Constitution for the reason the plea was coerced.", "discussion": "```json\n{\n  \"discussion\": \"Appellant argues his guilty plea was not knowing, intelligent, and voluntary because it was coerced. A guilty plea, if coerced or induced by promises or threats renders the plea involuntary. Appellant contends coercion is demonstrated in eight different ways. Each will be discussed in turn. First, he asserts his proffer was induced by promises of a certain punishment, but following the proffer the prosecutor improperly refused to recommend that punishment. Attached to Appellant’s sentencing memorandum is a record from the FBI - a February 11, 2015 interview with Appellant. Present at the interview were Appellant, FBI agents, detectives from the Canfield Police Department, and two prosecutors from the Mahoning County Prosecutor’s Office. The second paragraph of the report states: Panezich was advised he was being interviewed under proffered protection. Panezich agreed to plead guilty to the State of Ohio charges, further agreeing to a sentencing range of 3 to 7 years. As a condition to Panezich’s plea, Mahoning County Prosecutor’s Office would not oppose judicial release for Rose Panezich (Panezich’s mother) after 6 month incarceration. In addition, the Mahoning County Prosecutor’s Office would not charge Panezich’s grandmother or father. Also, included in the trial court records was a letter from one of the Mahoning County Prosecutors that was present at the February 2015 interview. The letter indicated Mahoning County was in the process of presenting the matter to the grand jury and the potential charges would include but would not be limited to the engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity charge. The letter indicated some of the other charges would be telecommunications fraud, theft, identify fraud, money laundering, and forgery. However, instead of obtaining a grand jury indictment, if Appellant pled guilty to the information charging Appellant with one count of engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity, then Mahoning County would recommend a sentence of “five (5) to seven (7) years.” The letter is dated March 25, 2015. The letter gave Appellant until April 10, 2015 to decide. As can be seen, the statement in the FBI report regarding the sentence the Mahoning County Prosecutor’s office would recommend at sentencing to a guilty plea does not match the statement made in the March 2015 letter. The record is devoid of what communication occurred between the prosecutor’s office and Panezich from the receipt of the March 2015 letter until the grand jury indictment in October 2016. The record does indicate a plea hearing was scheduled for September 26, 2016, but it was cancelled; Appellant indicated this in his October 2016 Motion to Modify Bond. The motion to modify bond indicates, due to concerns of the terms of the agreement, Appellant entered a not guilty plea on that date. The record, however, does not contain a judgment entry concerning this alleged September 26, 2016 pretrial/plea hearing. Thus, it is unclear whether the five year recommendation instead of three years in the letter was a typographical error or if the prosecutor was altering the offer. There is no indication that between the letter and the indictment, the discrepancy between the five and three year minimum recommendation was fixed. Appellant did eventually plead guilty to the indictment as amended and the prosecutor agreed to recommend an aggregate three to seven year sentence. Admittedly, the indictment contained seven additional charges not in the information – telecommunications fraud, aggravated theft, money laundering, three counts of forgery, and identity fraud. However, the agreement for the recommended three to seven year sentence was the same as the agreement made in February 2015. Given that the recommended sentencing range is the same as what was stated in February 2015 and what was recommended at the sentencing hearing in April 2017, it is unclear how any misstatement or alteration on the part of the prosecutor to the February 2015 agreement coerced him into pleading guilty in April 2017. Appellant’s second, third and fourth alleged acts of coercion concern bail. He contends the prosecutor asked for excessive bail in the amount of $500,000 as a means to coerce Appellant into pleading guilty. Appellant argues the prosecuting attorney justified the request for excessive bail by stating Appellant confessed. This alleged confession came from the proffer. Appellant asserts the trial court ordered the excessive bail in order to coerce Appellant into entering a guilty plea. Prior to the case being bound over to Mahoning County Common Pleas Court, the county court set bond at $100,000. Following the indictment, a bond hearing was held before the Common Pleas Court. The court set bond at $500,000. Given the fact that there were eight charges, the charges were first, second, and third degree felonies, and Appellant’s primary address was Nevada, setting the bond at $500,000 does not appear excessive or a means to coerce Appellant into pleading guilty. A transcript of the bond hearing was not properly made a part of the record. Appellant did attach a copy to the appellate brief, but it was struck. Appellant did not follow the proper rules to have the transcript made a part of the record. The record does not indicate what amount of bail the state requested. Furthermore, the record does not indicate the state supported its request for bail by stating Appellant confessed. Nothing in the record properly before us indicates the state told the court Appellant had confessed. Consequently, from the record before us, there is no evidence of coercion on the part of the state. Furthermore, the court’s action of setting bond at $500,000 does not indicate coercion on the part of the court. Persons accused of crimes are “bailable by sufficient sureties” and “[e]xcessive bail shall not be required.” Section 9, Article I, Ohio Constitution. The purpose of bail is to secure the attendance of the accused at trial. Jenkins v. Billy, 43 Ohio St.3d 84, 85, 538 N.E.2d 1045 (1989). As stated above, the degree of the felonies, the number of felonies charged, and Appellant’s residence in Nevada justified the amount of bail. Generally, a plea is involuntary and unconstitutional “if the judge's active conduct could lead a defendant to believe he cannot get a fair trial because the judge thinks that a trial is a futile exercise or that the judge would be biased against him at trial.” State v. Byrd, 63 Ohio St.2d 288, 293-294, 407 N.E.2d 1384 (1980). It is noted that usually when an appellant argues the trial court coerced him into entering the plea, the argument is based on the trial court's participation in the plea bargaining process. Id. at 292 (potential for coerced guilty pleas when judge participates in plea agreement process); State v. Davis, 4th Dist. No. 13CA3589, 2014-Ohio-5371, ¶ 31-34 (judicial participation is strongly discouraged but does not render a plea per se involuntary). There is no evidence in the record indicating the trial court's conduct during the bail hearing and order was coercive. Moreover, nothing in the record suggests the trial court participated in the plea bargaining process. Next, Appellant asserts that in order to get him to plead guilty the prosecuting attorney alleged Appellant’s mother, Rose Panezich, was guilty of a probation violation, the trial court found her guilty of probation violation, and she remained incarcerated until Appellant pled guilty. In the filings before the trial court, Appellant contended his mother was subpoenaed to testify at the grand jury proceedings. Before she could testify the prosecutor told her she would not be put on the stand because he believed she would lie and he was going to tell her probation officer she violated her probation. She was then incarcerated. The record in this case does indicate Rose Panezich was charged in connection with the criminal enterprise alleged against Appellant and she entered a plea agreement. The record before us, however, does not confirm Appellant’s version of events; the record is devoid of any indication whether Rose Panezich testified before the grand jury and what the terms of her plea agreement were. Part of Rose Panezich’s plea agreement and a condition of her probation may have been to cooperate with the state against any and all co-defendants and accomplices, which would include Appellant. This is a common condition set forth in plea agreements and probation. If she did not cooperate at the grand jury proceedings or if she did not cooperate at the interview with the prosecutor in preparation for the grand jury proceedings, then there would be a basis for a probation violation. Furthermore, part of Appellant’s argument is that it was coercive to indicate his mother would not be released from incarceration unless he pled guilty. The state’s indication that it would support her release if he pled guilty does not amount to coercion if there is no evidence showing Appellant was incompetent or incapable of making his own decision. State v. Slater, 8th Dist. No. 101358, 2014–Ohio–5552, ¶ 13 (familial pressure to enter plea does not equate to coercion in the absence of evidence that the defendant is incapable of making his own decision); State v. Parham, 11th Dist. No. 2011-P-0017, 2012-Ohio-2833, ¶ 26 (familial pressure does not result in a coerced plea). Appellate courts have found that a plea is not coerced when a defendant pleads guilty in exchange for the dismissal of charges against his family members. State v. Kesterson, 2d Dist. No. 95 CA 39, 1996 WL 280753 (May 24, 1996) (holding that, although the defendant “may have been given a choice between cooperating with the authorities or seeing his wife arrested,” this did not raise an issue as to whether his plea was voluntary); State v. Vild, 8th Dist. No. 69574, 1996 WL 492273 (Aug. 29, 1996) (no coercion was found where appellant’s plea was made in exchange for the dismissal of charges against his family members). Appellant’s sixth and seventh alleged acts of coercion concern the grand jury proceedings and his motion for a Kastigar hearing. The sixth allegation asserts the prosecuting attorney unlawfully presented testimony to the grand jury that was obtained through Appellant’s proffer. The seventh allegation asserts the trial court induced him to plead guilty by failing to act on Appellant’s request for a Kastigar hearing or to grant him access to the grand jury proceedings. Appellant moved for inspection of the grand jury proceedings. The trial court denied the request. Appellant did not appeal that ruling. The assertion that Appellant was coerced into pleading guilty because the prosecuting attorney used his statements made to the FBI under proffered protection is dependent on those statements being used. Without a transcript there is no basis to determine whether his factual presupposition is correct. Furthermore, the trial court made no statements in its judgment entry denying the request for grand jury transcripts that could have reasonably led Appellant to believe he could not get a fair trial because the judge either suggested that trial would be futile or that he would be biased against him. Davis, 2014-Ohio-5371 at ¶ 34. The judgment entry merely denied the request. Although Appellant did not appeal the denial of the grand jury transcripts, that ruling most likely would have been upheld if it was appealed. The Ohio Supreme Court has stated grand jury proceedings are secret, and thus, a defendant has no right to inspect grand jury transcripts either before or during trial unless the “ends of justice require it and there is a showing by the defense that a particularized need for disclosure exists which outweighs the need for secrecy.” State v. Greer, 66 Ohio St.2d 139, 420 N.E.2d 982 (1981), paragraph two of the syllabus. A defendant establishes a particularized need for grand jury transcripts when the circumstances reveal a probability that “the failure to disclose the testimony will deprive the defendant of a fair adjudication of the allegations placed in issue by the witness' trial testimony.” Id. at paragraph three of the syllabus. This determination is a fact question left to the sound discretion of the trial court. Id. at paragraphs one and three of the syllabus. Accordingly, “[a] decision denying the release of the grand jury transcript will not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion.” State v. Coley, 93 Ohio St.3d 253, 261, 754 N.E.2d 1129 (2001). An abuse of discretion is conduct that is unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. Blakemore v. Blakemore, 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 450 N.E.2d 1140 (1983). “A review under the abuse-of-discretion standard is a deferential review.” State v. Morris, 132 Ohio St.3d 337, 2012-Ohio-2407, 972 N.E.2d 528, ¶ 14. There is nothing in the record indicting Appellant could demonstrate a particularized need for the disclosure that outweighs the need for secrecy. Appellant was not able to demonstrate the failure to disclose the testimony deprived him of a fair adjudication of the allegations. If Appellant had not withdrawn his request for a *Kastigar* hearing and pled guilty, the issue of whether Appellant statements were protected from being used in state court could have been decided. The second district has succinctly explained the United States Supreme Court ruling in *Kastigar* and the test used for addressing a claim that immunized testimony will be improperly used by the state at trial: In *Kastigar*, the United States Supreme Court examined the constitutionality of a federal statute that provides immunity for witnesses who are then required to make statements against their interests. Section 6002, Title 18, United States Code. The Supreme Court held that the statute could be used to compel testimony from an unwilling witness over a claim of a Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination because the statute grants immunity from use of the compelled testimony and evidence derived therefrom in any subsequent criminal proceeding which is coextensive with the scope of the privilege. In other words, because the statute insures that a witness's immunized testimony will be inadmissible in any future criminal proceeding, as will be any evidence obtained by prosecutors directly or indirectly as a result of the immunized testimony, the protections afforded by the Fifth Amendment are not denied. *United States v. Orlando* (6th Cir., 2002), 281 F.3d 586, citing *United States v. Turner* (6th Cir., 1991), 936 F.2d 221, 223–224. *Kastigar* also adopted a two part test to be used when a witness claims that his or her immunized testimony was used. First, the government must deny any intent to use of the accused's own immunized testimony against him or her in a criminal case. Second, the government must affirmatively prove that all of the evidence proposed to be used is derived from legitimate sources, wholly independent of the compelled (immunized) testimony. *State v. Dillon*, 2d Dist. No. 05CA1674, 2006-Ohio-4931, ¶ 15. The *Kastigar* hearing could have ensured he had a fair adjudication of the allegations against him. Thus, there was no particularized need for the grand jury transcripts and no indication the grand jury proceedings were used to coerce him into pleading guilty. Furthermore, it is important to note that although Appellant claims the trial court failed to act on his Kastigar request, the record disputes that allegation. A trial court judgment entry indicates Appellant withdrew his suppression motion. The only suppression motion filed was titled, “Motion for a Kastigar Hearing and to Suppress all Evidence Derived in Violation of Kastigar.” Therefore, it cannot be claimed the trial court's disregard of the hearing request is evidence of coercion because the request was withdrawn, not disregarded. Lastly, Appellant asserts he was coerced into entering the guilty plea by the trial court's failure to rule on multiple pretrial motions. Although Appellant did file multiple pretrial motions, the record does not support the assertion that the trial court failed to rule on multiple pretrial motions. Appellant moved for relief from joinder, change of venue, a bill of particulars, disclosure of juvenile records of the state's witnesses, permission to submit a detailed jury questionnaire, disclosure of exculpatory and impeachment evidence, the ability to appear in civilian clothing without restraints, copies of the grand jury proceedings, an extension of time to file pretrial motions, and a motion for a Kastigar hearing and to suppress all evidence derived in violation of Kastigar. The trial court ruled on all motions except the request for a bill of particulars, relief from joinder, disclosure of juvenile records, and the motion relating to the Kastigar request. However, as stated above, the motion related to the Kastigar request was withdrawn. Therefore failing to rule on this motion cannot be considered to be part of the alleged coercion. One of the motions not ruled on was the request for a bill of particulars. We have previously explained that in light of Mahoning County's policy of “open discovery” in the prosecutor's office, where all of the state's evidence is available for the defendant to view in preparation of trial, the information that would be included in a bill of particulars is readily available to the defendant if the state possesses such information. State v. Kimbrough, 7th Dist. No. 08-MA-187, 2009-Ohio-6875, ¶ 19, citing State v. Brown, 7th Dist. No. 03-MA32, 2005-Ohio-2939, at ¶ 88. That does not mean a bill of particulars is not required in Mahoning County. *Kimbrough*. However, in order to demonstrate the failure to provide a timely requested bill of particulars requires reversal of the conviction, an appellant must demonstrate his “lack of knowledge concerning the specific facts a bill of particulars would have provided him actually prejudiced him in his ability to fairly defend himself.” *State v. Chinn*, 85 Ohio St.3d 548, 569, 709 N.E.2d 1166 (1999). Appellant cannot meet that test. The record in this case indicates all of the discovery was made available to him. 11/23/16 Request and Discovery Demand Notice and Receipt. Appellant had a conversation with the FBI and the Mahoning County Prosecutor’s office. Appellant was aware of the facts alleged against him. Also, the general rule is pretrial motions not ruled on are presumed to be overruled. See *State v. Duncan*, 8th Dist. No. 97208, 2012-Ohio-3683, ¶ 4 (motions not ruled on when a trial court enters final judgment are considered denied); *State v. Ryerson*, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2003-06-153, 2004-Ohio-3353, ¶ 55 (there is a “general rule that pretrial motions not ruled upon will ordinarily be presumed to have been overruled”). Thus, the other two motions not ruled on were overruled. Furthermore, failing to rule on those motions out of the numerous ones filed does not amount to the trial court coercing a guilty plea. The trial court’s failure to rule on the motions could not have led Appellant to believe he could not get a fair trial. Even when considering all eight allegations in conjunction with each other those allegations do not support the conclusion that Appellant was coerced into entering a guilty plea. None of the trial court’s actions could have led Appellant to believe he could not get a fair trial because the court thought a trial is a futile exercise or the court would be biased against him at trial. The record does not reflect there were any strong-arm measures used to coerce Appellant into pleading guilty. Furthermore, the state’s actions do not indicate coercion. It cannot be overlooked that the 2015 agreement on the sentencing range the state would recommend was the sentencing recommendation made at the 2017 sentencing.\"\n}\n```"}

A guilty plea, if coerced or induced by promises or threats renders the plea involuntary. Appellant contends coercion is demonstrated in eight different ways. Each will be discussed in turn. First, he asserts his proffer was induced by promises of a certain punishment, but following the proffer the prosecutor improperly refused to recommend that punishment. Attached to Appellant’s sentencing memorandum is a record from the FBI - a February 11, 2015 interview with Appellant. Present at the interview were Appellant, FBI agents, detectives from the Canfield Police Department, and two prosecutors from the Mahoning County Prosecutor’s Office. The second paragraph of the report states: Panezich was advised he was being interviewed under proffered protection. Panezich agreed to plead guilty to the State of Ohio charges, further agreeing to a sentencing range of 3 to 7 years. As a condition to Panezich’s plea, Mahoning County Prosecutor’s Office would not oppose judicial release for Rose Panezich (Panezich’s mother) after 6 month incarceration. In addition, the Mahoning County Prosecutor’s Office would not charge Panezich’s grandmother or father. Also, included in the trial court records was a letter from one of the Mahoning County Prosecutors that was present at the February 2015 interview. The letter indicated Mahoning County was in the process of presenting the matter to the grand jury and the potential charges would include but would not be limited to the engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity charge. The letter indicated some of the other charges would be telecommunications fraud, theft, identify fraud, money laundering, and forgery. However, instead of obtaining a grand jury indictment, if Appellant pled guilty to the information charging Appellant with one count of engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity, then Mahoning County would recommend a sentence of “five (5) to seven (7) years.” The letter is dated March 25, 2015. The letter gave Appellant until April 10, 2015 to decide. As can be seen, the statement in the FBI report regarding the sentence the Mahoning County Prosecutor’s office would recommend at sentencing to a guilty plea does not match the statement made in the March 2015 letter. The record is devoid of what communication occurred between the prosecutor’s office and Panezich from the receipt of the March 2015 letter until the grand jury indictment in October 2016. The record does indicate a plea hearing was scheduled for September 26, 2016, but it was cancelled; Appellant indicated this in his October 2016 Motion to Modify Bond. The motion to modify bond indicates, due to concerns of the terms of the agreement, Appellant entered a not guilty plea on that date. The record, however, does not contain a judgment entry concerning this alleged September 26, 2016 pretrial/plea hearing. Thus, it is unclear whether the five year recommendation instead of three years in the letter was a typographical error or if the prosecutor was altering the offer. There is no indication that between the letter and the indictment, the discrepancy between the five and three year minimum recommendation was fixed. Appellant did eventually plead guilty to the indictment as amended and the prosecutor agreed to recommend an aggregate three to seven year sentence. Admittedly, the indictment contained seven additional charges not in the information – telecommunications fraud, aggravated theft, money laundering, three counts of forgery, and identity fraud. However, the agreement for the recommended three to seven year sentence was the same as the agreement made in February 2015. Given that the recommended sentencing range is the same as what was stated in February 2015 and what was recommended at the sentencing hearing in April 2017, it is unclear how any misstatement or alteration on the part of the prosecutor to the February 2015 agreement coerced him into pleading guilty in April 2017. Appellant’s second, third and fourth alleged acts of coercion concern bail. He contends the prosecutor asked for excessive bail in the amount of $500,000 as a means to coerce Appellant into pleading guilty. Appellant argues the prosecuting attorney justified the request for excessive bail by stating Appellant confessed. This alleged confession came from the proffer. Appellant asserts the trial court ordered the excessive bail in order to coerce Appellant into entering a guilty plea. Prior to the case being bound over to Mahoning County Common Pleas Court, the county court set bond at $100,000. Following the indictment, a bond hearing was held before the Common Pleas Court. The court set bond at $500,000. Given the fact that there were eight charges, the charges were first, second, and third degree felonies, and Appellant’s primary address was Nevada, setting the bond at $500,000 does not appear excessive or a means to coerce Appellant into pleading guilty. A transcript of the bond hearing was not properly made a part of the record. Appellant did attach a copy to the appellate brief, but it was struck. Appellant did not follow the proper rules to have the transcript made a part of the record. The record does not indicate what amount of bail the state requested. Furthermore, the record does not indicate the state supported its request for bail by stating Appellant confessed. Nothing in the record properly before us indicates the state told the court Appellant had confessed. Consequently, from the record before us, there is no evidence of coercion on the part of the state. Furthermore, the court’s action of setting bond at $500,000 does not indicate coercion on the part of the court. Persons accused of crimes are “bailable by sufficient sureties” and “[e]xcessive bail shall not be required.” Section 9, Article I, Ohio Constitution. The purpose of bail is to secure the attendance of the accused at trial. Jenkins v. Billy, 43 Ohio St.3d 84, 85, 538 N.E.2d 1045 (1989). As stated above, the degree of the felonies, the number of felonies charged, and Appellant’s residence in Nevada justified the amount of bail. Generally, a plea is involuntary and unconstitutional “if the judge's active conduct could lead a defendant to believe he cannot get a fair trial because the judge thinks that a trial is a futile exercise or that the judge would be biased against him at trial.” State v. Byrd, 63 Ohio St.2d 288, 293-294, 407 N.E.2d 1384 (1980). It is noted that usually when an appellant argues the trial court coerced him into entering the plea, the argument is based on the trial court's participation in the plea bargaining process. Id. at 292 (potential for coerced guilty pleas when judge participates in plea agreement process); State v. Davis, 4th Dist. No. 13CA3589, 2014-Ohio-5371, ¶ 31-34 (judicial participation is strongly discouraged but does not render a plea per se involuntary). There is no evidence in the record indicating the trial court's conduct during the bail hearing and order was coercive. Moreover, nothing in the record suggests the trial court participated in the plea bargaining process. Next, Appellant asserts that in order to get him to plead guilty the prosecuting attorney alleged Appellant’s mother, Rose Panezich, was guilty of a probation violation, the trial court found her guilty of probation violation, and she remained incarcerated until Appellant pled guilty. In the filings before the trial court, Appellant contended his mother was subpoenaed to testify at the grand jury proceedings. Before she could testify the prosecutor told her she would not be put on the stand because he believed she would lie and he was going to tell her probation officer she violated her probation. She was then incarcerated. The record in this case does indicate Rose Panezich was charged in connection with the criminal enterprise alleged against Appellant and she entered a plea agreement. The record before us, however, does not confirm Appellant’s version of events; the record is devoid of any indication whether Rose Panezich testified before the grand jury and what the terms of her plea agreement were. Part of Rose Panezich’s plea agreement and a condition of her probation may have been to cooperate with the state against any and all co-defendants and accomplices, which would include Appellant. This is a common condition set forth in plea agreements and probation. If she did not cooperate at the grand jury proceedings or if she did not cooperate at the interview with the prosecutor in preparation for the grand jury proceedings, then there would be a basis for a probation violation. Furthermore, part of Appellant’s argument is that it was coercive to indicate his mother would not be released from incarceration unless he pled guilty. The state’s indication that it would support her release if he pled guilty does not amount to coercion if there is no evidence showing Appellant was incompetent or incapable of making his own decision. State v. Slater, 8th Dist. No. 101358, 2014–Ohio–5552, ¶ 13 (familial pressure to enter plea does not equate to coercion in the absence of evidence that the defendant is incapable of making his own decision); State v. Parham, 11th Dist. No. 2011-P-0017, 2012-Ohio-2833, ¶ 26 (familial pressure does not result in a coerced plea). Appellate courts have found that a plea is not coerced when a defendant pleads guilty in exchange for the dismissal of charges against his family members. State v. Kesterson, 2d Dist. No. 95 CA 39, 1996 WL 280753 (May 24, 1996) (holding that, although the defendant “may have been given a choice between cooperating with the authorities or seeing his wife arrested,” this did not raise an issue as to whether his plea was voluntary); State v. Vild, 8th Dist. No. 69574, 1996 WL 492273 (Aug. 29, 1996) (no coercion was found where appellant’s plea was made in exchange for the dismissal of charges against his family members). Appellant’s sixth and seventh alleged acts of coercion concern the grand jury proceedings and his motion for a Kastigar hearing. The sixth allegation asserts the prosecuting attorney unlawfully presented testimony to the grand jury that was obtained through Appellant’s proffer. The seventh allegation asserts the trial court induced him to plead guilty by failing to act on Appellant’s request for a Kastigar hearing or to grant him access to the grand jury proceedings. Appellant moved for inspection of the grand jury proceedings. The trial court denied the request. Appellant did not appeal that ruling. The assertion that Appellant was coerced into pleading guilty because the prosecuting attorney used his statements made to the FBI under proffered protection is dependent on those statements being used. Without a transcript there is no basis to determine whether his factual presupposition is correct. Furthermore, the trial court made no statements in its judgment entry denying the request for grand jury transcripts that could have reasonably led Appellant to believe he could not get a fair trial because the judge either suggested that trial would be futile or that he would be biased against him. Davis, 2014-Ohio-5371 at ¶ 34. The judgment entry merely denied the request. Although Appellant did not appeal the denial of the grand jury transcripts, that ruling most likely would have been upheld if it was appealed. The Ohio Supreme Court has stated grand jury proceedings are secret, and thus, a defendant has no right to inspect grand jury transcripts either before or during trial unless the “ends of justice require it and there is a showing by the defense that a particularized need for disclosure exists which outweighs the need for secrecy.” State v. Greer, 66 Ohio St.2d 139, 420 N.E.2d 982 (1981), paragraph two of the syllabus. A defendant establishes a particularized need for grand jury transcripts when the circumstances reveal a probability that “the failure to disclose the testimony will deprive the defendant of a fair adjudication of the allegations placed in issue by the witness' trial testimony.” Id. at paragraph three of the syllabus. This determination is a fact question left to the sound discretion of the trial court. Id. at paragraphs one and three of the syllabus. Accordingly, “[a] decision denying the release of the grand jury transcript will not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion.” State v. Coley, 93 Ohio St.3d 253, 261, 754 N.E.2d 1129 (2001). An abuse of discretion is conduct that is unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. Blakemore v. Blakemore, 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 450 N.E.2d 1140 (1983). “A review under the abuse-of-discretion standard is a deferential review.” State v. Morris, 132 Ohio St.3d 337, 2012-Ohio-2407, 972 N.E.2d 528, ¶ 14. There is nothing in the record indicting Appellant could demonstrate a particularized need for the disclosure that outweighs the need for secrecy. Appellant was not able to demonstrate the failure to disclose the testimony deprived him of a fair adjudication of the allegations. If Appellant had not withdrawn his request for a *Kastigar* hearing and pled guilty, the issue of whether Appellant statements were protected from being used in state court could have been decided. The second district has succinctly explained the United States Supreme Court ruling in *Kastigar* and the test used for addressing a claim that immunized testimony will be improperly used by the state at trial: In *Kastigar*, the United States Supreme Court examined the constitutionality of a federal statute that provides immunity for witnesses who are then required to make statements against their interests. Section 6002, Title 18, United States Code. The Supreme Court held that the statute could be used to compel testimony from an unwilling witness over a claim of a Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination because the statute grants immunity from use of the compelled testimony and evidence derived therefrom in any subsequent criminal proceeding which is coextensive with the scope of the privilege. In other words, because the statute insures that a witness's immunized testimony will be inadmissible in any future criminal proceeding, as will be any evidence obtained by prosecutors directly or indirectly as a result of the immunized testimony, the protections afforded by the Fifth Amendment are not denied. *United States v. Orlando* (6th Cir., 2002), 281 F.3d 586, citing *United States v. Turner* (6th Cir., 1991), 936 F.2d 221, 223–224. *Kastigar* also adopted a two part test to be used when a witness claims that his or her immunized testimony was used. First, the government must deny any intent to use of the accused's own immunized testimony against him or her in a criminal case. Second, the government must affirmatively prove that all of the evidence proposed to be used is derived from legitimate sources, wholly independent of the compelled (immunized) testimony. *State v. Dillon*, 2d Dist. No. 05CA1674, 2006-Ohio-4931, ¶ 15. The *Kastigar* hearing could have ensured he had a fair adjudication of the allegations against him. Thus, there was no particularized need for the grand jury transcripts and no indication the grand jury proceedings were used to coerce him into pleading guilty. Furthermore, it is important to note that although Appellant claims the trial court failed to act on his Kastigar request, the record disputes that allegation. A trial court judgment entry indicates Appellant withdrew his suppression motion. The only suppression motion filed was titled, “Motion for a Kastigar Hearing and to Suppress all Evidence Derived in Violation of Kastigar.” Therefore, it cannot be claimed the trial court's disregard of the hearing request is evidence of coercion because the request was withdrawn, not disregarded. Lastly, Appellant asserts he was coerced into entering the guilty plea by the trial court's failure to rule on multiple pretrial motions. Although Appellant did file multiple pretrial motions, the record does not support the assertion that the trial court failed to rule on multiple pretrial motions. Appellant moved for relief from joinder, change of venue, a bill of particulars, disclosure of juvenile records of the state's witnesses, permission to submit a detailed jury questionnaire, disclosure of exculpatory and impeachment evidence, the ability to appear in civilian clothing without restraints, copies of the grand jury proceedings, an extension of time to file pretrial motions, and a motion for a Kastigar hearing and to suppress all evidence derived in violation of Kastigar. The trial court ruled on all motions except the request for a bill of particulars, relief from joinder, disclosure of juvenile records, and the motion relating to the Kastigar request. However, as stated above, the motion related to the Kastigar request was withdrawn. Therefore failing to rule on this motion cannot be considered to be part of the alleged coercion. One of the motions not ruled on was the request for a bill of particulars. We have previously explained that in light of Mahoning County's policy of “open discovery” in the prosecutor's office, where all of the state's evidence is available for the defendant to view in preparation of trial, the information that would be included in a bill of particulars is readily available to the defendant if the state possesses such information. State v. Kimbrough, 7th Dist. No. 08-MA-187, 2009-Ohio-6875, ¶ 19, citing State v. Brown, 7th Dist. No. 03-MA32, 2005-Ohio-2939, at ¶ 88. That does not mean a bill of particulars is not required in Mahoning County. *Kimbrough*. However, in order to demonstrate the failure to provide a timely requested bill of particulars requires reversal of the conviction, an appellant must demonstrate his “lack of knowledge concerning the specific facts a bill of particulars would have provided him actually prejudiced him in his ability to fairly defend himself.” *State v. Chinn*, 85 Ohio St.3d 548, 569, 709 N.E.2d 1166 (1999). Appellant cannot meet that test. The record in this case indicates all of the discovery was made available to him. 11/23/16 Request and Discovery Demand Notice and Receipt. Appellant had a conversation with the FBI and the Mahoning County Prosecutor’s office. Appellant was aware of the facts alleged against him. Also, the general rule is pretrial motions not ruled on are presumed to be overruled. See *State v. Duncan*, 8th Dist. No. 97208, 2012-Ohio-3683, ¶ 4 (motions not ruled on when a trial court enters final judgment are considered denied); *State v. Ryerson*, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2003-06-153, 2004-Ohio-3353, ¶ 55 (there is a “general rule that pretrial motions not ruled upon will ordinarily be presumed to have been overruled”). Thus, the other two motions not ruled on were overruled. Furthermore, failing to rule on those motions out of the numerous ones filed does not amount to the trial court coercing a guilty plea. The trial court’s failure to rule on the motions could not have led Appellant to believe he could not get a fair trial. Even when considering all eight allegations in conjunction with each other those allegations do not support the conclusion that Appellant was coerced into entering a guilty plea. None of the trial court’s actions could have led Appellant to believe he could not get a fair trial because the court thought a trial is a futile exercise or the court would be biased against him at trial. The record does not reflect there were any strong-arm measures used to coerce Appellant into pleading guilty. Furthermore, the state’s actions do not indicate coercion. It cannot be overlooked that the 2015 agreement on the sentencing range the state would recommend was the sentencing recommendation made at the 2017 sentencing.\"\n}\n```"}
{"Index": "182-MORTON", "allegation_num": "allegation_1", "allegation": "I. Appellant was deprived of his constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel when trial counsel failed to, (A) object to prosecutorial misconduct, (B) effectively challenge the credibility of witnesses during cross examination, (C) effectively impeach witnesses’ prior inconsistent statements during cross examination, and (D) introduce exculpatory and mitigating evidence.", "discussion": "```json\n{\n  \"discussion\": \"Morton contends that his trial counsel was ineffective based on counsel’s failure to (1) object to instances of prosecutorial misconduct; (2) effectively cross-examine witnesses in light of their memory issues and developmental disabilities; (3) effectively cross-examine witnesses in light of inconsistencies in their prior statements; and (4) introduce exculpatory and mitigating evidence. To prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a criminal defendant must establish (1) deficient performance by counsel, i.e., performance falling below an objective standard of reasonable representation, and (2) prejudice, i.e., a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. Failure to satisfy either part of the test is fatal to the claim. Morton contends that the assistant prosecuting attorney engaged in misconduct in numerous statements he made in either opening statement or closing argument, and defense counsel failed to object. Parties are generally granted considerable latitude in presenting opening statements, so long as the matters referred to can be shown by competent or admissible evidence. Morton first contends that the assistant prosecuting attorney engaged in misconduct in closing argument with the following statement, which Morton contends was a reference to Morton’s decision not to testify: ‘Keep in mind ladies and gentlemen, that a defense to forcible rape is consent. You are to consider the evidence that you have heard and seen in this courtroom. What evidence have you heard or seen that she said anything but no?’ Morton is correct that a prosecutor’s comments regarding a defendant’s refusal to testify violate the accused’s Fifth Amendment right to remain silent. Prosecutors’ comments on a defendant’s refusal to testify have always been looked upon with extreme disfavor because they raise an inference of guilt from the defendant’s decision to remain silent. In effect, such comments penalize a defendant for choosing to exercise a constitutional right. Prosecutors must therefore take care not to equate the defendant’s silence to guilt. While direct comment on an accused’s failure to testify does violate the Fifth Amendment’s self-incrimination clause, ‘[a] reference by the prosecutor in closing argument to uncontradicted evidence is not a comment on the accused’s failure to testify, where the comment is directed to the strength of the state’s evidence and not to the silence of the accused, and the jury is instructed not to consider the accused’s failure to testify for any purpose.’ The assistant prosecutor’s reference, in the above-mentioned remarks, to the uncontradicted evidence was directed to the strength of the state’s evidence. In fact, the assistant prosecuting attorney reiterated that it was the state’s burden of proof several times during his opening statement and voir dire. For example, one potential juror, a human resources professional, indicated that she was used to listening to ‘both sides of a story’ at work. The assistant prosecuting attorney reminded the potential juror that it was solely the state’s burden of proof, and questioned the juror if she could be fair and impartial if she only heard ‘one side of the story.’ Moreover, the trial court instructed the jury not to consider Morton’s decision to not testify for any purpose. Even if Morton was the only potential witness who could have contradicted the victim’s testimony, the analysis does not change. In light of the above, defense counsel was not ineffective for not objecting to the assistant prosecuting attorney’s remarks. Morton next contends that, without objection from the defense, the assistant prosecuting attorney argued facts not in evidence and misstated evidence numerous times. The first instance Morton contends occurred when, in his opening statement, the assistant prosecuting attorney stated, ‘What you will learn is Mr. Morton does not know these people. He’s seen them around the neighborhood, but he does not know them, but he knows that, from what he’s seen, they are developmentally disabled.’ The second statement he complains of, also made in opening statement, was as follows: ‘He knew there was something wrong with them; and when [T.B.] shows up, he knows — she shows up because her mom drops her off. Almost a 30-year-old woman whose mom dropped her off at this house.’ Morton contends that these statements implicated his Fifth Amendment right; that is, he was the only person who would have been able to testify as to whether he knew the group. But the individuals also testified that they did not know Morton — they initially encountered him in the Metro PCS store, and thereafter Morton spent the entire day with them. It is true that the evidence did not establish that Morton had seen them around the neighborhood. But he did have an opportunity to see and interact with them at the cell phone store. And the testimony demonstrated that while the individuals were ‘functioning’ adults, there were indicators that they may have had disabilities. A reasonable inference from that could be that Morton observed the group and singled them out as a group he could latch on to. Thus, the assistant prosecuting attorney’s statements were proper for what he believed the strength of the state’s case would be. Defense counsel’s failure to object to the fleeting remark that Morton had seen the group around the neighborhood did not rise to ineffective assistance of counsel. The remaining statements Morton cites as objectionable occurred during closing argument, when the assistant prosecuting attorney argued the following: (1) ‘[T.B.] was substantially impaired because of autism’; (2) ‘[Morton] gave the police a different name. He did that because he knew sooner or later in that day something was going to take place that he didn’t want to answer for, and that’s why he gave them a fake name’; and (3) ‘[T.B.] testified that she never drank alcohol before.’ In regard to the statement about T.B.’s autism, Morton contends that the statement was not supported by any testimony and, therefore, the ‘misstatement of evidence [was] meant to tug at the heartstrings of the jury and enrage them.’ We are required to look at the closing argument as a whole to determine whether it deprived Morton of a fair trial or prejudiced him. Throughout the closing argument, the assistant prosecuting attorney argued that the combination of the medicine T.B. took with the alcohol impaired her; he also noted her Asperger’s diagnosis. The record supported the state’s argument. T.B. testified that the combination of the alcohol and her medicine made her feel drunk and lethargic. And her friends testified that Morton had to help her to the bathroom. The assistant prosecuting attorney’s statement neither deprived Morton of a fair trial nor prejudiced him. Defense counsel was not ineffective for not objecting. The next alleged misstatement Morton cites is the assistant prosecuting attorney’s argument that Morton gave the police a fake name because there was something he did not want to answer for. That was not a misstatement — Morton gave two different names during the relevant time frame: one name (‘Tony’) to the group of individuals and another name (‘Malcom Cline’) to the police. Prosecutors may draw reasonable inferences from the evidence at trial, commenting on those inferences during closing argument. It was a reasonable inference that Morton gave fake names to the group and to the police because he wanted to conceal his identity and, therefore, counsel was not ineffective for failing to object. The final alleged misstatement Morton contends deprived him of a fair trial was the assistant prosecuting attorney’s statement that T.B. never drank alcohol before. T.B. did testify that she was an occasional, social drinker. But she did testify that she had never had vodka before. Her friends also testified that she was not a heavy drinker. Based on the testimony, along with the trial court’s instructions that opening statements and closing arguments were not evidence, the assistant prosecuting attorney’s statement did not deprive Morton of a fair trial and defense counsel was not ineffective for not objecting. Moreover, shortly after the assistant prosecuting attorney made the argument about T.B. never having had alcohol before, he argued to the jury, ‘I wrote down what she said * * * she said she never had vodka before.’ In light of the above, we find no merit to Morton’s contention that his counsel was ineffective for failing to object to alleged facts not in evidence and misstatements of evidence.\"\n}\n```"}

State v. Hester (1976), 45 Ohio St.2d 71, 74 O.O.2d 156, 341 N.E.2d 304, paragraph four of the syllabus. When making that determination, a two-step process is usually employed. 'First, there must be a determination as to whether there has been a substantial violation of any of defense counsel's essential duties to his client. Next, and analytically separate from the question of whether the defendant's Sixth Amendment rights were violated, there must be a determination as to whether the defense was prejudiced by counsel's ineffectiveness.' State v. Lytle On the issue of counsel's ineffectiveness, the petitioner has the burden of proof, since in Ohio a properly licensed attorney is presumably competent. See Vaughn v. Maxwell (1965), 2 Ohio St.2d 299, 31 O.O.2d 567, 209 N.E.2d 164; State v. Jackson, 64 Ohio St.2d at 110–111, 18 O.O.3d at 351, 413 N.E.2d at 822. The first assignment of error alleges that counsel was ineffective for failing to object to statements of prior bad acts. The second assignment of error then claims that counsel was ineffective for not objecting when the State used those statements as support for its case in the rebuttal of closing argument. As the assignments of error are intertwined, we will address them together. One of the requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim is that counsel made an error that substantially affected his duties. Stein claims that counsel should have objected to the admission of irrelevant evidence and hearsay evidence. Relevant evidence is defined as 'evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.' Evid.R. 401. 'Evidence which is not relevant is not admissible.' Evid.R. 402. 'Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show conformity therewith.' Evid.R. 404(B). A review of the evidence shows that counsel failed to object to multiple instances of irrelevant evidence. Initially, the State brought in the testimony of Seibert to testify that Stein did not have the legal right to use the storage facility, and was thus stealing the use of the unit. Stein was not charged with a theft offense for the unauthorized use of the facility. Seibert was not able to testify as to what had been taken or even when the theft occurred as he was not the one who notified the police. The State argued at oral argument that Seibert’s testimony was relevant to establish that the theft occurred in Mercer County. That information is not relevant to this case, as the offenses at issue occurred in Logan County. Additionally, Taylor testified as to the break-in at the storage unit and how he knew that the vehicle he observed belonged to Stein. Seibert’s testimony served no real purpose other than to establish that Stein had committed a theft offense, which was not relevant to this case. Thus, this evidence was not admissible under the rules of evidence. The next series of instances of irrelevant evidence which was introduced at trial were the statements regarding the use and sale of illegal substances by Stein. These statements were made by Brugler during the interview, which was played to the jury. During the interview, Brugler repeatedly indicated that he believed that drugs were the motive for the shooting and implied that Stein was dealing meth. Statements about the presence of illegal substances were also introduced by the State when it questioned Eley as to whether he expected to find illegal drugs in the car when they robbed it. Tr. 140-41. Stein was not charged with any drug offenses in this case. Additionally, there was no testimony that any illegal drugs were stolen. All of the testimony indicated that there were no illegal substances stolen from the vehicle and thus none to be retrieved. Eley specifically testified that although he and Davidson had hoped there would be illegal drugs in the car, there were none. Tr. 140-42. This testimony was not relevant because it did not make any fact of consequence, i.e. whether the firing of the gun was felonious assault or self-defense, more or less likely. Stein also argues that the statements of Brugler regarding Eley’s statements were also hearsay. Hearsay is defined as 'a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Evid.R. 801(C). The statements in question were statements of Brugler made during the interview that Eley had told him that Stein was a drug dealer. These were out of court statements and do not meet one of the exceptions to make it admissible. The State argues that the statements were not hearsay because they were not offered for the truth of the matter asserted, i.e. that Stein was a drug dealer. However, this argument is not supported by the record. During the State’s rebuttal of closing arguments, the State made the following arguments to the jury while trying to give the jury a reason why Stein did not call the police to retrieve his stolen property. You know, in his interview, we hear about – the other witnesses brought up this mysterious guy named Casey that was also in the car going down. They didn’t tell the police about this Casey guy. Why aren’t they – what else aren’t they telling us? What else was in that backpack\\(^1\\) that no one’s talking about? Brett Eley gets caught with some meth in his pocket on the way down to Dayton – I’m sorry, Jason Davidson. Car crash, meth in his pocket, he’s fleeing from Logan County. Brett Eley is a meth user. They asked him [Stein] twice in the interview, does he get his meth from you, Mr. Stein? First time he doesn’t even respond. Second time he says no, he gets it from somebody else. So, why aren’t they talking about this? Because a drug dealer cannot report that his drugs have been stolen. What we have here is a thug going back to get his property. Prudent, law-abiding citizens – his words – don’t take guns over to people’s property – go on to their property, threaten them with it intimidate them with it. Tr. 390-91. If the statements regarding Stein being a drug dealer were not being offered for the truth of the matter asserted and no other evidence exists that Stein was a drug dealer, the State cannot imply during closing arguments that Stein is a drug dealer. The statements were hearsay, did not meet an exception, and should have been excluded upon a proper objection by trial counsel. \\(\\{\\text{¶34}\\}\\) The State also argued that there was no prejudice from the statements because they were exculpatory to the defendant since he denied the accusation. If the statements were exculpatory, what basis did the State have to infer that Stein was a drug dealer? As discussed above, there was no admissible evidence that Stein was dealing drugs because there were no charges involving drugs in this case. Thus, this argument to the jury made by the State had no rational relationship to Stein’s charges. Given that irrelevant evidence of prior bad acts was admitted and improper statements by the State during closing argument focused on that evidence, counsel’s performance was deficient by not objecting. Having found errors by counsel during trial, the next question is whether the errors were prejudicial. A judgment of conviction shall not be reversed based upon the erroneous admission of evidence 'unless it affirmatively appears on the record that the accused was or may have been prejudiced thereby.' R.C. 2945.83(C). 'The real issue when Evid.R. 404(B) evidence is improperly admitted at trial is whether a defendant has suffered any prejudice as a result.' State v. Morris, 141 Ohio St.3d 399, 2014-Ohio-5052, 24 N.E.3d 1153, ¶ 25. To make this determination, an appellate court must focus on both the impact of the offending evidence on the verdict and the strength of the remaining evidence. Id. The Ohio Supreme Court then stated three guiding principles: 1) was there prejudice; 2) can the appellate court state that 'the error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt; and 3) does the remaining evidence provide overwhelming evidence of guilt. Id. at ¶ 27-29. The Court noted that a new trial is necessary in cases where the appellate court cannot 'find beyond a reasonable doubt that the improper evidence had no effect' on the verdict. *Id.* at ¶30. The Court also held that the actions of the prosecutor'may combine with an evidentiary error to cause greater impact. *Id.* at ¶ 31. In the Morris case, the lower court had reversed the conviction not only because inflammatory evidence had been admitted into a case that was not strong, but also because the State had repeatedly referred to the evidence in closing argument. *Id.* at ¶30. The Ohio Supreme Court affirmed the appellate court’s determination that in *Morris*, they could not find that the admission of prior bad acts did not affect the verdict and that without the statements, the defendant would have been found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. *Id.* at ¶ 33. This case, like *Morris*, involves a case where evidence regarding other bad acts was admitted. 'Under longstanding principles of Anglo–American jurisprudence, an accused cannot be convicted of one crime by proving he committed other crimes or is a bad person.' *State v. Jamison*, 49 Ohio St.3d 182, 184, 552 N.E.2d 180 (1990). The State argued during closing arguments that Stein was not entitled to the self-defense verdict because he was a drug dealer who was going to retrieve his drugs. The State also referred to Stein as a thug. There was no evidence that any drugs were involved in this case. Stein was not charged with any drug related offenses and Eley testified there were no drugs stolen. Yet the State argued that there were and that Stein was a drug dealer. This argument may have caused the jury to regard Stein as a bad person who was more likely to be acting in accord with his criminal nature than one who was acting to protect his own life when he fired his weapon. This court cannot find that this evidence and the argument of the State did not have an impact on the verdict. Additionally, the remainder of the evidence was not overwhelming when it comes to self-defense. The testimony was inconsistent as to what happened, how Stein was carrying the gun, and even who shot first. Davidson, who was the one who shot Stein, testified that he fired first and Stein returned fire after he had been shot. Given the inconsistency of the testimony, this court does not find that the jury could not have found that the affirmative defense of self-defense was applicable and that the verdict would be the same beyond a reasonable doubt. Therefore, we cannot find that the errors of counsel were harmless. The first and second assignments of error are therefore sustained.\"\n}\n```"}

{"Index": "187-Stein", "allegation_num": "allegation_4", "allegation": "Fourth Assignment of Error: The cumulative effects of Stein’s first [three] assignments of error denied him a fair trial.", "discussion": "```json\n{\n  \"discussion\": \"In evaluating whether a petitioner has been denied effective assistance of counsel, this court has held that the test is 'whether the accused, under all the circumstances, * * * had a fair trial and substantial justice was done.' State v. Hester (1976), 45 Ohio St.2d 71, 74 O.O.2d 156, 341 N.E.2d 304, paragraph four of the syllabus. When making that determination, a two-step process is usually employed. 'First, there must be a determination as to whether there has been a substantial violation of any of defense counsel's essential duties to his client. Next, and analytically separate from the question of whether the defendant's Sixth Amendment rights were violated, there must be a determination as to whether the defense was prejudiced by counsel's ineffectiveness.' State v. Lytle On the issue of counsel's ineffectiveness, the petitioner has the burden of proof, since in Ohio a properly licensed attorney is presumably competent. See Vaughn v. Maxwell (1965), 2 Ohio St.2d 299, 31 O.O.2d 567, 209 N.E.2d 164; State v. Jackson, 64 Ohio St.2d at 110–111, 18 O.O.3d at 351, 413 N.E.2d at 822. The first assignment of error alleges that counsel was ineffective for failing to object to statements of prior bad acts. The second assignment of error then claims that counsel was ineffective for not objecting when the State used those statements as support for its case in the rebuttal of closing argument. As the assignments of error are intertwined, we will address them together. One of the requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim is that counsel made an error that substantially affected his duties. Stein claims that counsel should have objected to the admission of irrelevant evidence and hearsay evidence. Relevant evidence is defined as 'evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.' Evid.R. 401. 'Evidence which is not relevant is not admissible.' Evid.R. 402. 'Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show conformity therewith.' Evid.R. 404(B). A review of the evidence shows that counsel failed to object to multiple instances of irrelevant evidence. Initially, the State brought in the testimony of Seibert to testify that Stein did not have the legal right to use the storage facility, and was thus stealing the use of the unit. Stein was not charged with a theft offense for the unauthorized use of the facility. Seibert was not able to testify as to what had been taken or even when the theft occurred as he was not the one who notified the police. The State argued at oral argument that Seibert’s testimony was relevant to establish that the theft occurred in Mercer County. That information is not relevant to this case, as the offenses at issue occurred in Logan County. Additionally, Taylor testified as to the break-in at the storage unit and how he knew that the vehicle he observed belonged to Stein. Seibert’s testimony served no real purpose other than to establish that Stein had committed a theft offense, which was not relevant to this case. Thus, this evidence was not admissible under the rules of evidence. The next series of instances of irrelevant evidence which was introduced at trial were the statements regarding the use and sale of illegal substances by Stein. These statements were made by Brugler during the interview, which was played to the jury. During the interview, Brugler repeatedly indicated that he believed that drugs were the motive for the shooting and implied that Stein was dealing meth. Statements about the presence of illegal substances were also introduced by the State when it questioned Eley as to whether he expected to find illegal drugs in the car when they robbed it. Tr. 140-41. Stein was not charged with any drug offenses in this case. Additionally, there was no testimony that any illegal drugs were stolen. All of the testimony indicated that there were no illegal substances stolen from the vehicle and thus none to be retrieved. Eley specifically testified that although he and Davidson had hoped there would be illegal drugs in the car, there were none. Tr. 140-42. This testimony was not relevant because it did not make any fact of consequence, i.e. whether the firing of the gun was felonious assault or self-defense, more or less likely. Stein also argues that the statements of Brugler regarding Eley’s statements were also hearsay. Hearsay is defined as 'a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Evid.R. 801(C). The statements in question were statements of Brugler made during the interview that Eley had told him that Stein was a drug dealer. These were out of court statements and do not meet one of the exceptions to make it admissible. The State argues that the statements were not hearsay because they were not offered for the truth of the matter asserted, i.e. that Stein was a drug dealer. However, this argument is not supported by the record. During the State’s rebuttal of closing arguments, the State made the following arguments to the jury while trying to give the jury a reason why Stein did not call the police to retrieve his stolen property. You know, in his interview, we hear about – the other witnesses brought up this mysterious guy named Casey that was also in the car going down. They didn’t tell the police about this Casey guy. Why aren’t they – what else aren’t they telling us? What else was in that backpack\\(^1\\) that no one’s talking about? Brett Eley gets caught with some meth in his pocket on the way down to Dayton – I’m sorry, Jason Davidson. Car crash, meth in his pocket, he’s fleeing from Logan County. Brett Eley is a meth user. They asked him [Stein] twice in the interview, does he get his meth from you, Mr. Stein? First time he doesn’t even respond. Second time he says no, he gets it from somebody else. So, why aren’t they talking about this? Because a drug dealer cannot report that his drugs have been stolen. What we have here is a thug going back to get his property. Prudent, law-abiding citizens – his words – don’t take guns over to people’s property – go on to their property, threaten them with it intimidate them with it. Tr. 390-91. If the statements regarding Stein being a drug dealer were not being offered for the truth of the matter asserted and no other evidence exists that Stein was a drug dealer, the State cannot imply during closing arguments that Stein is a drug dealer. The statements were hearsay, did not meet an exception, and should have been excluded upon a proper objection by trial counsel. \\(\\{\\text{¶34}\\}\\) The State also argued that there was no prejudice from the statements because they were exculpatory to the defendant since he denied the accusation. If the statements were exculpatory, what basis did the State have to infer that Stein was a drug dealer? As discussed above, there was no admissible evidence that Stein was dealing drugs because there were no charges involving drugs in this case. Thus, this argument to the jury made by the State had no rational relationship to Stein’s charges. Given that irrelevant evidence of prior bad acts was admitted and improper statements by the State during closing argument focused on that evidence, counsel’s performance was deficient by not objecting. Having found errors by counsel during trial, the next question is whether the errors were prejudicial. A judgment of conviction shall not be reversed based upon the erroneous admission of evidence 'unless it affirmatively appears on the record that the accused was or may have been prejudiced thereby.' R.C. 2945.83(C). 'The real issue when Evid.R. 404(B) evidence is improperly admitted at trial is whether a defendant has suffered any prejudice as a result.' State v. Morris, 141 Ohio St.3d 399, 2014-Ohio-5052, 24 N.E.3d 1153, ¶ 25. To make this determination, an appellate court must focus on both the impact of the offending evidence on the verdict and the strength of the remaining evidence. Id. The Ohio Supreme Court then stated three guiding principles: 1) was there prejudice; 2) can the appellate court state that 'the error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt; and 3) does the remaining evidence provide overwhelming evidence of guilt. Id. at ¶ 27-29. The Court noted that a new trial is necessary in cases where the appellate court cannot 'find beyond a reasonable doubt that the improper evidence had no effect' on the verdict. *Id.* at ¶30. The Court also held that the actions of the prosecutor'may combine with an evidentiary error to cause greater impact. *Id.* at ¶ 31. In the Morris case, the lower court had reversed the conviction not only because inflammatory evidence had been admitted into a case that was not strong, but also because the State had repeatedly referred to the evidence in closing argument. *Id.* at ¶30. The Ohio Supreme Court affirmed the appellate court’s determination that in *Morris*, they could not find that the admission of prior bad acts did not affect the verdict and that without the statements, the defendant would have been found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. *Id.* at ¶ 33. This case, like *Morris*, involves a case where evidence regarding other bad acts was admitted. 'Under longstanding principles of Anglo–American jurisprudence, an accused cannot be convicted of one crime by proving he committed other crimes or is a bad person.' *State v. Jamison*, 49 Ohio St.3d 182, 184, 552 N.E.2d 180 (1990). The State argued during closing arguments that Stein was not entitled to the self-defense verdict because he was a drug dealer who was going to retrieve his drugs. The State also referred to Stein as a thug. There was no evidence that any drugs were involved in this case. Stein was not charged with any drug related offenses and Eley testified there were no drugs stolen. Yet the State argued that there were and that Stein was a drug dealer. This argument may have caused the jury to regard Stein as a bad person who was more likely to be acting in accord with his criminal nature than one who was acting to protect his own life when he fired his weapon. This court cannot find that this evidence and the argument of the State did not have an impact on the verdict. Additionally, the remainder of the evidence was not overwhelming when it comes to self-defense. The testimony was inconsistent as to what happened, how Stein was carrying the gun, and even who shot first. Davidson, who was the one who shot Stein, testified that he fired first and Stein returned fire after he had been shot. Given the inconsistency of the testimony, this court does not find that the jury could not have found that the affirmative defense of self-defense was applicable and that the verdict would be the same beyond a reasonable doubt. Therefore, we cannot find that the errors of counsel were harmless. The first and second assignments of error are therefore sustained.\"\n}\n```"}

Kirkland*, 140 Ohio St.3d 73, 2014-Ohio-1966, 15 N.E.3d 818, ¶ 68; see R.C. 2945.59. Generally, other-acts evidence is admissible if (1) it is offered for a purpose other than to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity with that character, Evid.R. 404(B), (2) it is relevant when offered for that purpose, and (3) the danger of unfair prejudice does not substantially outweigh the probative value, Evid.R. 403. *Kirkland* at ¶ 68, citing *State v. Williams*, 143 Ohio St.3d 521, 2012-Ohio-5695, 983 N.E.2d 1278, ¶ 20. Evans points to the exchange between the assistant prosecuting attorney and Brown, during direct examination, where the prosecutor asked about a fight Brown had had with Evans the night before. The assistant prosecuting attorney asked Brown, ‘Did this argument get physical or was there a lot of screaming?’ Brown responded, ‘Yes, it was a lot of screaming and he choked me. Like, he would slam me to the ground and stuff like that, but he never punched me.’ Evans argues that Brown’s testimony was improper other-acts evidence, which denied him a fair trial. Evans, however, did not object to the testimony, and thus, he has forfeited all but plain error. For this court to reverse on plain error, we must find that (1) there was an error, (2) the error was plain, i.e., an obvious defect in the trial court proceedings, and (3) the error affected substantial rights, i.e., it affected the outcome of the trial. State v. Barnes, 94 Ohio St.3d 21, 27, 759 N.E.2d 1240 (2002). Brown’s testimony about her physical fight with Evans the night before was relevant evidence because it demonstrated Evans’s motive and intent when he kicked in the door of the group home the following morning. See State v. Hamm, 1st Dist. Hamilton Nos. C-160230 and C-160231, 2017-Ohio-5595, ¶ 17-18; State v. Murry, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-130289, 2014-Ohio-1812, ¶ 8-11; State v. Marshall, 4th Dist. Lawrence No. o6CA23, 2007-Ohio-06298, ¶ 51-54; State v. Blonski, 125 Ohio App.3d 103, 113, 707 N.E.2d 1168 (9th Dist.1997). Thus, the admission of her testimony was not plain error when it was not error under Evid.R. 404(B). Evans also argues that the assistant prosecuting attorney improperly elicited other-acts evidence to impeach his credibility when he asked Evans on cross-examination about his prior misdemeanor-assault conviction: PROSECUTING ATTORNEY: Is it your testimony that you never assaulted Santana Benton? EVANS: No, I never assaulted her. I grabbed her. But I’ve never assaulted her, no, sir. PROSECUTING ATTORNEY: Do you remember coming down and pleading guilty to an assault? EVANS: I never pled guilty. We took it to trial. I told the Judge, I forgot which Judge it was, and she said in the statement I told her I grabbed her. And she said, well, that constituted assault. They didn’t give me any time. They pretty much gave me the time served on the charge. PROSECUTING ATTORNEY: My question was, when you went in front of Judge Grant, you were found guilty of assault? EVANS: You said pled guilty. Yes, I was found guilty on that. PROSECUTING ATTORNEY: Sorry. You were found guilty of assault against Santana Benton, right? EVANS: Yes, sir. Evans argues that the colloquy regarding his prior conviction violated Evid.R. 404(B) because it painted him as a violent person with a history of assaultive behavior and because it was an improper means of impeachment under Evid.R. 609. ‘Evid.R. 609 prohibits the use of a prior misdemeanor conviction to attack a witness’ credibility unless the crime involved dishonesty or a false statement.’ State v. Lewis, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 93AP-911, 1994 WL 171181, *8 (Apr. 28, 1994); see State v. Stokes, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 2016-CA-4, 2016-Ohio-7520, ¶ 31. The state concedes and we agree that the trial court’s admission of this testimony was improper. It does not fit within an Evid.R. 609 exception for prior convictions, and it was not offered for a valid purpose under Evid.R. 404(B). See State v. Ellis, 8 Ohio App.3d 27, 28, 455 N.E.2d 1025 (10th Dist.1982). However, we cannot conclude the admission of this evidence rises to the level of plain error. Evans’s case was tried to the court. In a bench trial, the judge is presumed to consider only materially admissible evidence. *State v. Fox*, 69 Ohio St.3d 183, 189, 631 N.E.2d 124 (1994). Here, the trial court supplied its reasoning for finding Evans guilty on the record, which did not include its consideration of this evidence. Thus, the admission of this other-acts evidence did not affect the outcome of the trial. *See State v. Williams*, 38 Ohio St.3d 346, 351, 528 N.E.2d 910 (1988) (holding harmless error in admitting defendant’s prior conviction, in light of remaining properly introduced evidence of defendant’s guilt).

Evid.R. 404(B) states that ‘[e]vidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith.’ Such evidence, may, however, be admissible for other purposes, including ‘as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.’ *State v. Kirkland*, 140 Ohio St.3d 73, 2014-Ohio-1966, 15 N.E.3d 818, ¶ 68; see R.C. 2945.59. Generally, other-acts evidence is admissible if (1) it is offered for a purpose other than to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity with that character, Evid.R. 404(B), (2) it is relevant when offered for that purpose, and (3) the danger of unfair prejudice does not substantially outweigh the probative value, Evid.R. 403. *Kirkland* at ¶ 68, citing *State v.

Evans points to the exchange between the assistant prosecuting attorney and Brown, during direct examination, where the prosecutor asked about a fight Brown had had with Evans the night before. The assistant prosecuting attorney asked Brown, ‘Did this argument get physical or was there a lot of screaming?’ Brown responded, ‘Yes, it was a lot of screaming and he choked me. Like, he would slam me to the ground and stuff like that, but he never punched me.’ Evans argues that Brown’s testimony was improper other-acts evidence, which denied him a fair trial. Evans, however, did not object to the testimony, and thus, he has forfeited all but plain error. For this court to reverse on plain error, we must find that (1) there was an error, (2) the error was plain, i.e., an obvious defect in the trial court proceedings, and (3) the error affected substantial rights, i.e., it affected the outcome of the trial. State v. Barnes, 94 Ohio St.3d 21, 27, 759 N.E.2d 1240 (2002). Brown’s testimony about her physical fight with Evans the night before was relevant evidence because it demonstrated Evans’s motive and intent when he kicked in the door of the group home the following morning. See State v. Hamm, 1st Dist. Hamilton Nos. C-160230 and C-160231, 2017-Ohio-5595, ¶ 17-18; State v. Murry, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-130289, 2014-Ohio-1812, ¶ 8-11; State v. Marshall, 4th Dist.

Thus, the admission of her testimony was not plain error when it was not error under Evid.R. 404(B). Evans also argues that the assistant prosecuting attorney improperly elicited other-acts evidence to impeach his credibility when he asked Evans on cross-examination about his prior misdemeanor-assault conviction: PROSECUTING ATTORNEY: Is it your testimony that you never assaulted Santana Benton? EVANS: No, I never assaulted her. I grabbed her. But I’ve never assaulted her, no, sir. PROSECUTING ATTORNEY: Do you remember coming down and pleading guilty to an assault? EVANS: I never pled guilty. We took it to trial. I told the Judge, I forgot which Judge it was, and she said in the statement I told her I grabbed her. And she said, well, that constituted assault. They didn’t give me any time. They pretty much gave me the time served on the charge. PROSECUTING ATTORNEY: My question was, when you went in front of Judge Grant, you were found guilty of assault? EVANS: You said pled guilty. Yes, I was found guilty on that. PROSECUTING ATTORNEY: Sorry. You were found guilty of assault against Santana Benton, right? EVANS: Yes, sir. Evans argues that the colloquy regarding his prior conviction violated Evid.R. 404(B) because it painted him as a violent person with a history of assaultive behavior and because it was an improper means of impeachment under Evid.R. 609. ‘Evid.R. 609 prohibits the use of a prior misdemeanor conviction to attack a witness’ credibility unless the crime involved dishonesty or a false statement.’ State v. Lewis, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 93AP-911, 1994 WL 171181, *8 (Apr. 28, 1994); see State v. Stokes, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 2016-CA-4, 2016-Ohio-7520, ¶ 31. The state concedes and we agree that the trial court’s admission of this testimony was improper. It does not fit within an Evid.R. 609 exception for prior convictions, and it was not offered for a valid purpose under Evid.R. 404(B). See State v. Ellis, 8 Ohio App.3d 27, 28, 455 N.E.2d 1025 (10th Dist.1982). However, we cannot conclude the admission of this evidence rises to the level of plain error. Evans’s case was tried to the court. In a bench trial, the judge is presumed to consider only materially admissible evidence. *State v. Fox*, 69 Ohio St.3d 183, 189, 631 N.E.2d 124 (1994). Here, the trial court supplied its reasoning for finding Evans guilty on the record, which did not include its consideration of this evidence. Thus, the admission of this other-acts evidence did not affect the outcome of the trial. *See State v. Williams*, 38 Ohio St.3d 346, 351, 528 N.E.2d 910 (1988) (holding harmless error in admitting defendant’s prior conviction, in light of remaining properly introduced evidence of defendant’s guilt).

Thomas*, 2018-Ohio-1081, 109 N.E.3d 616, ¶ 50 (8th Dist.).\\n\\nNewman claims that the prosecutor went beyond the bounds of appropriate trial advocacy in numerous ways: (1) by phrasing a question to a witness that she was on 'zero' PCP at the time of the shooting (tr. 512); (2) the prosecutor elicited perjured, or at the very least, unbelievable testimony from another witness; (3) the prosecutor committed misconduct during the testimony of a police officer that interviewed witnesses shortly after the shooting; and (4) the prosecutor went beyond the bounds of appropriate trial tactics when questioning another witness by badgering and harassing her.\\n\\nDuring the pretrial phase, the state requested that it be allowed to call Samantha Harrison ('Harrison') as a hostile witness, or in the alternative, as a court’s witness because Harrison, a passenger in the car with Harris when he was shot, had provided a written statement retracting previous statements identifying Newman as the gunman. In her most recent statement she indicated that she was high on PCP at the time of the shooting and that’s why her former statements were incorrect. (Tr. 58-60.) At trial, Harrison testified that she smoked PCP the night of the shooting. (Tr. 495.) Through questioning, the state attempted to show that Harrison was not high on PCP that night.\\n\\nDuring the testimony of Dr. Aisha Violette, the physician who treated Harrison for the wounds she sustained as a result of the shooting, the state asked numerous questions about Harrison’s physical condition. Dr. Violette testified that Harrison did not appear to be under the influence of PCP while at the hospital and the 'labs didn’t pick up any influence of drugs, correct, not the ones I recall.' (Tr. 453.) The state also highlighted the lack of PCP in lab results contained in Harrison’s medical records. (Tr. 503.)\\n\\nThis was not the prosecutor testifying, as Newman claims in support of his argument that the prosecutor acted improperly during trial. The line of questioning was appropriate given the recantation of prior statements and the stated reason for the recantation. 'Prosecutors are entitled to latitude as to what the evidence has shown and what inferences can reasonably be drawn from the evidence.' State v. Mason, 82 Ohio St.3d 144, 162, 694 N.E.2d 932 (1998), quoting State v. Smith, 80 Ohio St.3d 89, 111, 684 N.E.2d 668 (1997). Further, '[a] prosecutor may state his opinion if it is based on the evidence presented at trial.' Id., quoting State v. Watson, 61 Ohio St.3d 1, 10, 572 N.E.2d 97 (1991).\\n\\nNewman next claims that the testimony of Harris was so incredible that to elicit it amounted to prosecutorial misconduct.\\n\\nHarris testified that a man approached his car as he was stopped. The man was holding a revolver and put the gun through Harris’s open window and said 'run your pockets,' which Harris understood to mean he was being robbed. Harris struggled with the man and several shots were fired into the vehicle while the two fought over the firearm. During the struggle, Harris lifted the right sleeve of the gunman’s shirt, revealing a tattoo. Harris said that during the skirmish, he was trying to separate the gunman’s hand from the gun and he slid the gunman’s sleeve up. (Tr. 349.) Harris testified that the tattoo was of a skull with a flame on it and placed about midway up the gunman’s upper arm. (Tr. 350.) During trial, Newman was required to roll up his sleeve, and Harris was able to view Newman’s right bicep and found that the tattoo on Newman was the same as the one on the gunman that approached his vehicle and shot him. (Tr. 354.)\\n\\n'Prosecutorial misconduct via the presentation of perjured testimony requires the defendant to show that the prosecution knew the testimony was false.' State v. Clark, 7th Dist. Mahoning No. 08 MA 15, 2015-Ohio-2584, ¶ 24, citing State v. Iacona, 93 Ohio St.3d 83, 97, 752 N.E.2d 937 (2001).\\n\\nThere is no evidence in the record that the prosecutor knew Harris’s testimony was false. Further, it is not so unbelievable that during a struggle for a firearm clothing would be displaced. There is no evidence that this testimony, even if unbelievable, was knowingly false and elicited by actions of the prosecutor. See State v. Hillman, 10th Dist. Franklin Nos. 06AP-1230 and 07AP-728, 2008-Ohio-2341, ¶ 29. Therefore, this does not amount to prosecutorial misconduct.\\n\\nNewman next claims that when questioning Victoria Bascon ('Bascon'), another passenger in the car that Harris was driving, the state badgered her, taunted her, and acted inappropriately.\\n\\nDuring Bascon’s testimony, the state asked that she be treated as hostile on the basis of surprise. The record discloses that just prior to her testimony, she spoke with the prosecutor and a Cuyahoga County sheriff’s deputy and stated that she could identify the individual that shot at the driver of the vehicle in which she was riding. However, during her testimony, she indicated that she could not identify the shooter and did not see his face.\\n\\nThe questioning that followed was contentious, but did not stray beyond the bounds of proper questioning within the various rules of procedure. For instance, Newman claims that the prosecutor taunted the witness about the length of time she took to answer questions. However, even the trial court commented on the length of time it took for the witness to answer simple questions: 'Ma’am, it’s clear during your testimony, it was stilted. It was long delays in questions that should have produced — are you under some type of threat — has someone threatened you?' (Tr. 426.) The prosecutor’s questioning was not inappropriate under these circumstances.\\n\\nSimilarly, Newman points to the testimony of a police officer, Jacqueline Bennett ('Bennett'), regarding a witness identification of the shooter. (Tr. 370-382.) However, the solicitation of this testimony, to which no objection was raised, does not constitute prosecutorial misconduct. This argument does not present a reason to grant the application for reopening.\\n\\nPlain error does not exist in this record to establish that prosecutorial misconduct deprived Newman of a fair trial. There is no probability of a different outcome had appellate counsel raised prosecutorial misconduct on appeal. Therefore, Newman has not set forth a colorable claim that appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise this as an assignment of error.\"\n}\n```"}

{"Index": "110-Daboni", "allegation_num": "allegation_2", "allegation": "The verdicts on the counts of engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity were not supported by sufficient evidence.", "discussion": "```json\n{\n  \"discussion\": \"Appellant contends that the trial court erred in failing to merge, for purposes of sentencing, offenses that had a similar import, arose from the same conduct, and were not committed separately or with a separate animus. The State argues the trial court did not err in refusing to merge those counts for purposes of sentencing, arguing the offenses did not arise from the same conduct, and because they were committed separately or with a separate animus. The record reveals that trafficking count one stemmed from heroin that was found downstairs that was individually packaged, which was sold or offered to be sold. Trafficking count two stemmed from heroin that was found downstairs in another location that was individually packaged and prepared for shipment, transport, delivery, or distribution. Both of these trafficking counts stemmed from law enforcement finding, collectively, fifty-three baggies of individually wrapped heroin in two different locations in the downstairs of Appellant’s residence. The total amount of heroin found in these two downstairs locations was 20.9 grams. Conversely, the possession count stemmed from 24.94 grams of heroin found in an upstairs bedroom closet of the same residence that was not individually packaged. Thus, the total amount of heroin found in Appellant's residence was 45.84 grams and the total amount is what was cited in each of the separate offenses contained in the indictments and was apparently used to justify elevating the felonies to higher levels than the base fifth-degree felony as provided for in the statutes. This combined amount of 45.84 grams is referenced as well in the 'More Particular Bill of Particulars' filed by the State in each individual case. Appellant argues that under the Ruff analysis, all of these offenses should have merged because, under the first prong of Ruff, they were not dissimilar in import or significance, as they did not involve separate victims and no separate or identifiable harm resulted. Appellant argues that under the second prong of Ruff, the offenses were not committed separately, noting the drugs were recovered on the same day, in the same house and were the same substance. Appellant argues, under the third prong of Ruff, that the crimes were not committed with a separate animus, as all of the evidence presented at trial indicated a single motivation by Appellant, which was to traffic heroin. Quoting from the sentencing transcript, Appellant points out the following argument made by the State during sentencing: 'The testimony was pretty clear that uh the Defendant was not a drug user. He was here purely to traffic in drugs.' The State argues, under the first step of the Ruff analysis, which requires consideration of whether the offenses were committed with similar import or significance, that the victim for each of the offenses is the same, and the victim is society. However, the State contends that the resulting harm from the offenses is separate and identifiable. The State argues the harm resulting from the trafficking counts is to other individuals who would then possess and traffic the heroin themselves or use it. The State argues that the harm resulting from the possession was different in that no other individuals were harmed by Appellant merely possessing the heroin. The State makes no argument that Appellant was harmed by the possession of the heroin or that he intended it for his personal use. Rather, the State argues other individuals would be 'harmed or potentially harmed when Appellant sells or ships that heroin to others.' Based upon this reasoning, the State argues the offenses at issue, under these facts, were of dissimilar import or significance. The State argues under the second step of the Ruff analysis that the offenses were committed separately, and argues the fact that the drugs at issue were recovered on the same day, in the same house and were the same substance, does not equate to the offenses not being committed separately. The State argues that Appellant took active steps to engage in trafficking of the heroin found downstairs, which was individually packaged for sale. It further argues there was no evidence Appellant took any steps to engage in trafficking of the heroin found in ball form upstairs. The State argues, under the third step of the Ruff analysis, that the trafficking and possession counts here were committed with a separate animus and motivation. The State argues that Appellant took active steps to prepare the specific heroin that was the subject of the trafficking counts for sale or shipment, but that he did not possess the heroin that is the subject of the possession offense with the same animus or motivation. The State argues that 'while Appellant likely would have trafficked the heroin that was found upstairs, he took no active steps to traffic that heroin and possessed no immediate motive to traffic that heroin.' The State further argues that speculation that Appellant would have trafficked the heroin at some point in the future is not enough to support a charge of trafficking in heroin, and that Appellant merely possessed the heroin found upstairs 'with the animus or motivation to simply possess it at that time.' The State relies upon State v. Rodriguez, 2016-Ohio-452, 59 N.E.3d 619 in support of its arguments. Rodriguez was sentenced separately for trafficking, stemming from the seizure of marijuana from his associate’s backpack shortly after leaving Rodriguez’s residence, and possession of marijuana, stemming from the subsequent discovery of marijuana found in Rodriguez’s apartment shortly thereafter. Id. at ¶ 34. The Rodriguez court refused to merge the trafficking and possession counts for purposes of sentencing, arguing that there was no evidence in the record Rodriguez possessed and trafficked the marijuana with a single animus, for the purpose of trafficking. Id. at ¶ 28. The court went on to note that possession of drugs and trafficking of drugs are not always allied offenses of similar import when they are committed separately or where a different animus or motivation is present. Id. at ¶ 30. The State also relies on State v. Montoya, 12th Dist. Clermont No. CA2012-02-015, 2013-Ohio-3312, which found that possession and trafficking of heroin were not allied offenses of similar import where the defendant sold two to three balloons of heroin at a time but retained additional balloons of heroin that were not sold or offered for sale. Appellant argues the State’s reliance on Rodriguez is misplaced, arguing that the present case is factually distinguishable from Rodriguez as the record here clearly indicates that Appellant always possessed the heroin at issue for purposes of trafficking. Appellant cites this Court’s prior reasoning in State v. Shaw, 4th Dist. Scioto No. 07CA3190, 2008-Ohio-5910, which focused on whether the record showed the defendant’s sole purpose in possessing drugs was to sell them. In Shaw, we held that trafficking and possession of crack cocaine were allied offenses of similar import where there was no evidence that the defendant intended to retain a portion of the crack cocaine for personal use, and where the defendant’s confession and the prosecutor’s statement indicated the defendant possessed the drugs with the purpose of selling them. Id. at ¶ 14. The State criticizes Appellant’s reliance on Shaw, arguing the law regarding the analysis of allied offenses of similar import has changed since Shaw was decided in 2008, and noting Shaw employed the two-step allied offenses analysis set forth in State v. Cabrales, which it argues has since been replaced with the three-step analysis set forth in Ruff. As set forth in Rodriguez, supra, although it is possible to possess a drug with the same animus and conduct necessary to traffic it, once the drug is initially possessed, a separate animus 'distinct in time, supported by different conduct' can take place resulting in the additional offense being committed separately. Id. at ¶ 29. Thus, possession and trafficking offenses may be allied offenses of similar import, or not, depending on the particular facts and motivations of those involved. After contemplating the questions set forth in Ruff, we disagree with the trial court’s conclusion that the possession offense should not merge with the trafficking offenses. First, with respect to the first prong of the Ruff analysis, we conclude the offenses were of similar import and significance. The offenses of possession and trafficking in drugs, in this case heroin, are similar in significance and import where, as is the case here, the victims of the offense were the same and the harm was not separate and identifiable. As conceded by both parties, the victims of these offenses is society in general. We are not persuaded by the State’s argument that the possession offense, under these facts (which include no indication Appellant was a drug user himself), had a different victim than the trafficking offenses or resulted in a separate, identifiable harm. Thus, we conclude based upon the facts before us that the offenses herein are of similar import and significance. Second, with respect to the second prong of the Ruff analysis, we cannot conclude that the offenses were committed separately. As argued by Appellant, the trafficking and possession offenses at issue stemmed from heroin found during a search of Appellant’s residence. All charges involve drugs found on the same date, in the same residence, and involving the same substance: heroin. While we agree with the State that these factors do not automatically equate to the offenses not being committed separately, we believe under the facts presently before us, they do. This case is factually distinguishable from Rodriguez in that Rodguez’s trafficking charge was based upon drugs found in a backpack of his associate that were found outside in a car, while the possession charge was based upon drugs found inside his mother’s apartment. Id. ¶28. Here, all of the heroin was found inside Appellant’s residence, albeit in different locations. We believe this situation is much more similar to the facts in State v. Shaw, supra, where Shaw was charged with possession and trafficking of drugs after a traffic stop led to the discovery of drugs on his person, and also in a C.D. case in the vehicle he was driving. Shaw at ¶ 1. This court determined on appeal that Shaw's sentences for trafficking and possession should have merged where there was no evidence in the record to suggest he intended to retain a portion of the drugs at issue for his own use. Id. at ¶ 5. We further reject the State’s argument that the offenses should not merge because Appellant took active steps to traffic the heroin found downstairs, but did not take active steps to traffic the heroin found upstairs. Not only is there no evidence in the record indicating Appellant took active steps to traffic the heroin that was the subject of the possession offense, there is likewise no evidence in the record suggesting Appellant was a drug user or committed the possession offense separately to use the heroin himself. In light of Shaw, we believe this lack of evidence favors finding the offenses were not committed separately, especially when considering the analysis under the next step of the Ruff test. Finally, with respect to the third prong of the Ruff analysis, we cannot conclude these offenses were committed with a separate animus or motivation. While the State argued in its brief that Appellant possessed the heroin at issue merely to possess it, it also conceded in its brief that Appellant likely would have eventually trafficked it. As argued by Appellant, there is simply no evidence in the record to suggest Appellant was a drug user, or that his motivation in possessing the heroin found upstairs was possessed for the purpose of personal use. In this regard, the facts before us are directly on point with Shaw, supra. In fact, as set forth above, the State explicitly argued as much at the sentencing hearing, stating it was clear that Appellant’s purpose was 'purely to traffic in drugs.' The reasonable inference from the record before us is that Appellant and/or those working for him simply had not packaged the upstairs heroin for sale yet. Conversely, in Rodriguez, supra, at ¶ 28, the court noted that there was nothing in the record before it 'to establish that Rodriguez possessed the marijuana and trafficked a portion of it with only one animus or motivation * * *.' Here there is absolutely no evidence in the record Appellant was a drug user or possessed with the motivation to use. Further, and contrary to the State’s argument, we believe the analysis set forth in State v. Shaw, supra, is applicable to the facts presently before us, despite the fact that it was released prior to the more detailed allied offenses test set forth in Ruff. In reaching its decision, Shaw relied on the reasoning of State v. Cabrales, 118 Ohio St.3d 54, 2008-Ohio-1625, 886 N.E.2d 181, for the proposition that trafficking and possession of drugs are allied offenses of similar import. Shaw at ¶ 13; citing Cabrales at ¶ 31. However, as noted in Shaw, the Cabrales test requires consideration of the defendant's conduct to determine whether the offenses were committed separately or with a separate animus. Id. at ¶ 14; citing Cabrales at ¶ 14. In that regard, the Cabrales test is not unlike the test set forth in Ruff. In fact, both the First and Eighth District Courts of Appeals have stated that the conclusion reached in Cabrales survives the application of Ruff, and thus they declined to depart from it. See State v. Bradley, 2015-Ohio-5421, 55 N.E.3d 580, ¶ 42 (8th Dist. 2015) and State v. Murph, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-150263, 2015-Ohio-5076, ¶ 7. Thus, we find Shaw is still relevant, instructive and applicable. In light of the foregoing, we conclude that the trial court erred in failing to merge the possession of heroin with the already-merged trafficking in heroin counts, for purposes of sentencing. For this reason, we sustain Appellant’s first assignment of error. Accordingly, we reverse the trial court's imposition of sentences on these counts and remand this matter to the trial court with instructions to impose a single, mandatory sentence of eight years for the all three merged offenses.\"\n}\n```"}

The State argues that 'while Appellant likely would have trafficked the heroin that was found upstairs, he took no active steps to traffic that heroin and possessed no immediate motive to traffic that heroin.' The State further argues that speculation that Appellant would have trafficked the heroin at some point in the future is not enough to support a charge of trafficking in heroin, and that Appellant merely possessed the heroin found upstairs 'with the animus or motivation to simply possess it at that time.' The State relies upon State v. Rodriguez, 2016-Ohio-452, 59 N.E.3d 619 in support of its arguments. Rodriguez was sentenced separately for trafficking, stemming from the seizure of marijuana from his associate’s backpack shortly after leaving Rodriguez’s residence, and possession of marijuana, stemming from the subsequent discovery of marijuana found in Rodriguez’s apartment shortly thereafter. Id. at ¶ 34. The Rodriguez court refused to merge the trafficking and possession counts for purposes of sentencing, arguing that there was no evidence in the record Rodriguez possessed and trafficked the marijuana with a single animus, for the purpose of trafficking. Id. at ¶ 28. The court went on to note that possession of drugs and trafficking of drugs are not always allied offenses of similar import when they are committed separately or where a different animus or motivation is present. Id. at ¶ 30. The State also relies on State v. Montoya, 12th Dist. Clermont No. CA2012-02-015, 2013-Ohio-3312, which found that possession and trafficking of heroin were not allied offenses of similar import where the defendant sold two to three balloons of heroin at a time but retained additional balloons of heroin that were not sold or offered for sale. Appellant argues the State’s reliance on Rodriguez is misplaced, arguing that the present case is factually distinguishable from Rodriguez as the record here clearly indicates that Appellant always possessed the heroin at issue for purposes of trafficking. Appellant cites this Court’s prior reasoning in State v. Shaw, 4th Dist. Scioto No. 07CA3190, 2008-Ohio-5910, which focused on whether the record showed the defendant’s sole purpose in possessing drugs was to sell them. In Shaw, we held that trafficking and possession of crack cocaine were allied offenses of similar import where there was no evidence that the defendant intended to retain a portion of the crack cocaine for personal use, and where the defendant’s confession and the prosecutor’s statement indicated the defendant possessed the drugs with the purpose of selling them. Id. at ¶ 14. The State criticizes Appellant’s reliance on Shaw, arguing the law regarding the analysis of allied offenses of similar import has changed since Shaw was decided in 2008, and noting Shaw employed the two-step allied offenses analysis set forth in State v. Cabrales, which it argues has since been replaced with the three-step analysis set forth in Ruff. As set forth in Rodriguez, supra, although it is possible to possess a drug with the same animus and conduct necessary to traffic it, once the drug is initially possessed, a separate animus 'distinct in time, supported by different conduct' can take place resulting in the additional offense being committed separately. Id. at ¶ 29. Thus, possession and trafficking offenses may be allied offenses of similar import, or not, depending on the particular facts and motivations of those involved. After contemplating the questions set forth in Ruff, we disagree with the trial court’s conclusion that the possession offense should not merge with the trafficking offenses. First, with respect to the first prong of the Ruff analysis, we conclude the offenses were of similar import and significance. The offenses of possession and trafficking in drugs, in this case heroin, are similar in significance and import where, as is the case here, the victims of the offense were the same and the harm was not separate and identifiable. As conceded by both parties, the victims of these offenses is society in general. We are not persuaded by the State’s argument that the possession offense, under these facts (which include no indication Appellant was a drug user himself), had a different victim than the trafficking offenses or resulted in a separate, identifiable harm. Thus, we conclude based upon the facts before us that the offenses herein are of similar import and significance. Second, with respect to the second prong of the Ruff analysis, we cannot conclude that the offenses were committed separately. As argued by Appellant, the trafficking and possession offenses at issue stemmed from heroin found during a search of Appellant’s residence. All charges involve drugs found on the same date, in the same residence, and involving the same substance: heroin. While we agree with the State that these factors do not automatically equate to the offenses not being committed separately, we believe under the facts presently before us, they do. This case is factually distinguishable from Rodriguez in that Rodguez’s trafficking charge was based upon drugs found in a backpack of his associate that were found outside in a car, while the possession charge was based upon drugs found inside his mother’s apartment. Id. ¶28. Here, all of the heroin was found inside Appellant’s residence, albeit in different locations. We believe this situation is much more similar to the facts in State v. Shaw, supra, where Shaw was charged with possession and trafficking of drugs after a traffic stop led to the discovery of drugs on his person, and also in a C.D. case in the vehicle he was driving. Shaw at ¶ 1. This court determined on appeal that Shaw's sentences for trafficking and possession should have merged where there was no evidence in the record to suggest he intended to retain a portion of the drugs at issue for his own use. Id. at ¶ 5. We further reject the State’s argument that the offenses should not merge because Appellant took active steps to traffic the heroin found downstairs, but did not take active steps to traffic the heroin found upstairs. Not only is there no evidence in the record indicating Appellant took active steps to traffic the heroin that was the subject of the possession offense, there is likewise no evidence in the record suggesting Appellant was a drug user or committed the possession offense separately to use the heroin himself. In light of Shaw, we believe this lack of evidence favors finding the offenses were not committed separately, especially when considering the analysis under the next step of the Ruff test. Finally, with respect to the third prong of the Ruff analysis, we cannot conclude these offenses were committed with a separate animus or motivation. While the State argued in its brief that Appellant possessed the heroin at issue merely to possess it, it also conceded in its brief that Appellant likely would have eventually trafficked it. As argued by Appellant, there is simply no evidence in the record to suggest Appellant was a drug user, or that his motivation in possessing the heroin found upstairs was possessed for the purpose of personal use. In this regard, the facts before us are directly on point with Shaw, supra. In fact, as set forth above, the State explicitly argued as much at the sentencing hearing, stating it was clear that Appellant’s purpose was 'purely to traffic in drugs.' The reasonable inference from the record before us is that Appellant and/or those working for him simply had not packaged the upstairs heroin for sale yet. Conversely, in Rodriguez, supra, at ¶ 28, the court noted that there was nothing in the record before it 'to establish that Rodriguez possessed the marijuana and trafficked a portion of it with only one animus or motivation * * *.' Here there is absolutely no evidence in the record Appellant was a drug user or possessed with the motivation to use. Further, and contrary to the State’s argument, we believe the analysis set forth in State v. Shaw, supra, is applicable to the facts presently before us, despite the fact that it was released prior to the more detailed allied offenses test set forth in Ruff. In reaching its decision, Shaw relied on the reasoning of State v. Cabrales, 118 Ohio St.3d 54, 2008-Ohio-1625, 886 N.E.2d 181, for the proposition that trafficking and possession of drugs are allied offenses of similar import. Shaw at ¶ 13; citing Cabrales at ¶ 31. However, as noted in Shaw, the Cabrales test requires consideration of the defendant's conduct to determine whether the offenses were committed separately or with a separate animus. Id. at ¶ 14; citing Cabrales at ¶ 14. In that regard, the Cabrales test is not unlike the test set forth in Ruff. In fact, both the First and Eighth District Courts of Appeals have stated that the conclusion reached in Cabrales survives the application of Ruff, and thus they declined to depart from it. See State v. Bradley, 2015-Ohio-5421, 55 N.E.3d 580, ¶ 42 (8th Dist. 2015) and State v. Murph, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-150263, 2015-Ohio-5076, ¶ 7. Thus, we find Shaw is still relevant, instructive and applicable. In light of the foregoing, we conclude that the trial court erred in failing to merge the possession of heroin with the already-merged trafficking in heroin counts, for purposes of sentencing. For this reason, we sustain Appellant’s first assignment of error. Accordingly, we reverse the trial court's imposition of sentences on these counts and remand this matter to the trial court with instructions to impose a single, mandatory sentence of eight years for the all three merged offenses.\"\n}\n```"}
{"Index": "110-Daboni", "allegation_num": "allegation_4", "allegation": "The imposition of maximum possible sentences on all counts is not clearly and convincingly supported by the record.", "discussion": "```json\n{\n  \"discussion\": \"Appellant contends that the trial court erred in failing to merge, for purposes of sentencing, offenses that had a similar import, arose from the same conduct, and were not committed separately or with a separate animus. The State argues the trial court did not err in refusing to merge those counts for purposes of sentencing, arguing the offenses did not arise from the same conduct, and because they were committed separately or with a separate animus. The record reveals that trafficking count one stemmed from heroin that was found downstairs that was individually packaged, which was sold or offered to be sold. Trafficking count two stemmed from heroin that was found downstairs in another location that was individually packaged and prepared for shipment, transport, delivery, or distribution. Both of these trafficking counts stemmed from law enforcement finding, collectively, fifty-three baggies of individually wrapped heroin in two different locations in the downstairs of Appellant’s residence. The total amount of heroin found in these two downstairs locations was 20.9 grams. Conversely, the possession count stemmed from 24.94 grams of heroin found in an upstairs bedroom closet of the same residence that was not individually packaged. Thus, the total amount of heroin found in Appellant's residence was 45.84 grams and the total amount is what was cited in each of the separate offenses contained in the indictments and was apparently used to justify elevating the felonies to higher levels than the base fifth-degree felony as provided for in the statutes. This combined amount of 45.84 grams is referenced as well in the 'More Particular Bill of Particulars' filed by the State in each individual case. Appellant argues that under the Ruff analysis, all of these offenses should have merged because, under the first prong of Ruff, they were not dissimilar in import or significance, as they did not involve separate victims and no separate or identifiable harm resulted. Appellant argues that under the second prong of Ruff, the offenses were not committed separately, noting the drugs were recovered on the same day, in the same house and were the same substance. Appellant argues, under the third prong of Ruff, that the crimes were not committed with a separate animus, as all of the evidence presented at trial indicated a single motivation by Appellant, which was to traffic heroin. Quoting from the sentencing transcript, Appellant points out the following argument made by the State during sentencing: 'The testimony was pretty clear that uh the Defendant was not a drug user. He was here purely to traffic in drugs.' The State argues, under the first step of the Ruff analysis, which requires consideration of whether the offenses were committed with similar import or significance, that the victim for each of the offenses is the same, and the victim is society. However, the State contends that the resulting harm from the offenses is separate and identifiable. The State argues the harm resulting from the trafficking counts is to other individuals who would then possess and traffic the heroin themselves or use it. The State argues that the harm resulting from the possession was different in that no other individuals were harmed by Appellant merely possessing the heroin. The State makes no argument that Appellant was harmed by the possession of the heroin or that he intended it for his personal use. Rather, the State argues other individuals would be 'harmed or potentially harmed when Appellant sells or ships that heroin to others.' Based upon this reasoning, the State argues the offenses at issue, under these facts, were of dissimilar import or significance. The State argues under the second step of the Ruff analysis that the offenses were committed separately, and argues the fact that the drugs at issue were recovered on the same day, in the same house and were the same substance, does not equate to the offenses not being committed separately. The State argues that Appellant took active steps to engage in trafficking of the heroin found downstairs, which was individually packaged for sale. It further argues there was no evidence Appellant took any steps to engage in trafficking of the heroin found in ball form upstairs. The State argues, under the third step of the Ruff analysis, that the trafficking and possession counts here were committed with a separate animus and motivation. The State argues that Appellant took active steps to prepare the specific heroin that was the subject of the trafficking counts for sale or shipment, but that he did not possess the heroin that is the subject of the possession offense with the same animus or motivation. The State argues that 'while Appellant likely would have trafficked the heroin that was found upstairs, he took no active steps to traffic that heroin and possessed no immediate motive to traffic that heroin.'

BAGLEY, 473 U.S. 667 (1985).", "discussion": "```json\n{\n  \"discussion\": \"On appeal, Brantley argues that the trial court abused its discretion by applying the materiality standard set forth in Bagley as opposed to the more defense-friendly standard set forth in Giglio. Brantley maintains that applying the improper standard caused the trial court to reach an incorrect result with respect to its materiality analysis. In support of his underlying position, Brantley stresses that Townsend was the only witness to place Brantley and Haywood at the scene of the crime around the time the murders were committed. Although Townsend never testified that Ms. Welch mentioned Brantley while she was peering into her apartment, Brantley argues that mentioning Haywood was just as impactful given that the State’s theory of the case was predicated on the notion that Brantley and Haywood were together that evening. Brantley further emphasizes that Townsend was the last witness to see Ms. Welch and Ms. Nash alive. A review of the record in this matter reveals that the testimony offered by Townsend regarding his whereabouts on the evening of the murders was consistent with information police obtained through phone records and surveillance videos. The State also presented evidence of cell tower logs that placed Brantley and Haywood near the Kimlyn Circle apartments on the evening of the murders. The State presented evidence that several of Townsend’s friends attended the gathering hosted by Mr. Roberts on the evening of April 17, 2013, including Isaac Love and Kevin Cook. While Townsend testified that he was unaware of drugs exchanging hands that evening, Mr. Love and Mr. Cook testified that drug transactions did in fact take place. Cell phone records showed that Mr. Roberts’ phone received a call from a phone registered to Haywood shortly after 1:00 a.m. on April 18, 2013. Not long after, a call was made from Haywood’s phone to Deonte Woods. Mr. Woods was connected to Brantley and Haywood through both friendship as well as their involvement in the drug world. When Haywood called Mr. Woods, he asked Mr. Woods to follow him to an undisclosed location. Haywood did not explain why he needed Mr. Woods to follow him but Mr. Woods testified that such requests were not necessarily uncommon in their relationship. Haywood drove to Mr. Woods’ residence in a black Kia. Brantley was a passenger in the vehicle. Mr. Woods then followed Haywood and Brantley in his red Kia to the Gurley Avenue area of Akron, which is close to the Kimlyn Circle apartments. When they arrived, Brantley and Haywood instructed Mr. Woods to park his vehicle. Haywood and Brantley then drove away. While he sat in his vehicle, Mr. Woods fell asleep. When Mr. Woods awoke, he attempted to call and text the two men but he was unable to reach them. The State presented phone records showing that Haywood received a text message at 2:10 a.m. that stated, ‘Kill both of these niggas.’ (Sic.) The text message was sent from a phone number associated with Brantley. Another text message from the phone number associated with Brantley was sent to Haywood at 2:48 a.m. that stated, ‘I’m bouta shoot Dutch go get da shit and then I’ma kill both des n****** but u got to hurry up so we can get up out of here[.]’ (Sic.) Brantley eventually called Mr. Woods to check if he was still there and if there was anyone else in the area. Brantley and Haywood then jogged to Mr. Woods’ vehicle and got in. Brantley was holding a white t-shirt and a small bag that looked to contain approximately half an ounce of drugs. Mr. Woods was aware that half an ounce of drugs could be worth a substantial sum of money. After Brantley and Haywood got into the vehicle, Mr. Woods heard one of them say, ‘Take it to our grave.’ Mr. Woods did not know who made that statement but he clarified that one of them told him, ‘Take it to our grave or I’ll kill you.’ Mr. Woods specifically heard Brantley say, ‘I doubled back to kill them.’ Although Mr. Woods was not exactly sure about what had transpired, he did not ask any questions. Instead, he transported Brantley and Haywood to Donte’s Game Day bar and then went home. The following morning, Haywood texted Mr. Woods and asked if Mr. Woods had told his cousin about what happened. Mr. Woods responded in the negative. Isaac Love, who had attended the Kimlyn Circle gathering on the evening of April 17, 2013, testified that he placed a call to Mr. Roberts the following morning. An unfamiliar man answered the phone. When Mr. Love called the number a second time, a woman answered the phone. Mr. Love assumed that Ms. Welch had answered the phone. When Mr. Love asked to speak with Mr. Roberts, the woman indicated that he was not around. Mr. Love then inquired as to when Mr. Roberts would return. The woman responded that would never happen. Mr. Love and his wife then drove to the Kimlyn Circle apartments in an attempt to figure out what was going on. The door to Mr. Roberts’ apartment was opened. Mr. Love entered and he ultimately discovered the bodies of Mr. Roberts, Ms. Welch, Mr. Delaney, and Ms. Nash in the basement. Mr. Love notified the police. Cell phone records played a large role in police coming to suspect Brantley and Haywood. Police did not find any cell phones in the basement of the Kimlyn Circle apartment. However, Mr. Roberts’ phone was located in the middle of a street on April 18, 2013, and it was ultimately turned over to police. The last incoming call on Mr. Roberts’ phone around the time of the incident was from a phone associated with Haywood. When police spoke with Haywood, they found that his phone had been reset to its factory setting. Police were able to obtain information about Haywood’s calls and texts through Verizon and it was at that time they learned that he had received two texts about killing people at approximately 2:00 a.m. on April 18, 2013. During a subsequent interview with Brantley, police learned that the texts were sent from a phone associated with him. The mother of Haywood’s child, S.J., attempted to reach Haywood on multiple occasions during the early morning hours of April 18, 2013. S.J. also attempted to reach Brantley and Mr. Woods. Roughly a week after the incident, S.J. sent a text message to Brantley expressing concern that police had Mr. Roberts’ phone, and that Brantley’s number was in his phone. Several days later, S.J. sent another message to Brantley where she suggested that Brantley and Haywood needed to change their phone numbers. With the aid of a software program, police were able to figure out that Brantley deleted a text that he had sent to Haywood that referenced killing people. Police also learned that, on the afternoon of April 18, 2013, Haywood had sent Brantley a screenshot of a news article reporting on the murders. A careful review of the record reveals that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Brantley’s petition. This holds true regardless of whether the trial court applied the materiality standard set forth in Giglio or the materiality standard set forth in Bagley. Even under the more defense-friendly materiality standard set forth in Giglio, Brantley has not demonstrated that there is any reasonable likelihood that Townsend’s false testimony affected the judgment of the jury with respect to either Brantley’s underlying convictions or the sentence imposed. See Giglio, 405 U.S. at 154. While Brantley analogizes the facts of this case to Giglio, we note that Giglio involved a scenario where the prosecution’s case hinged ‘almost entirely’ on the testimony of the witness who gave false testimony about his deal with the prosecution. Id. at 154. By contrast, the State’s case here included an overwhelming amount of circumstantial evidence against Brantley that was independent from Townsend’s testimony. The State’s most compelling evidence against Brantley was not predicated on a finding by the jury that Townsend was credible. While Brantley argues that Townsend was the only witness to place Brantley and Haywood at the scene of the murders, the State presented evidence of cell tower logs that showed Brantley and Haywood were in the vicinity of the Kimlyn Circle apartments around the time of the murders. Mr. Woods testified that he followed Brantley and Haywood to a street in the vicinity of the Kimlyn Circle apartments, where he was ordered to wait. After he received a call from Brantley to make sure nobody was around, Brantley and Haywood returned to Mr. Woods’ vehicle. When Brantley and Haywood entered the vehicle, Mr. Woods heard Brantley say that he ‘doubled back to kill them.’ One of the men threatened Mr. Woods by saying, ‘Take it to our grave or I’ll kill you.’ The State further presented evidence that Brantley sent Haywood two texts that discussed killing people that evening, including one that referenced shooting ‘Dutch[.]’ Under these circumstances, Brantley has not demonstrated that there is any reasonable likelihood that Townsend’s false testimony affected the judgment of the jury with respect to either his convictions or sentence. Accordingly, we cannot say that the trial court’s denial of Brantley’s petition constituted an abuse of discretion.\"\n}\n```"}

Haywood did not explain why he needed Mr. Woods to follow him but Mr. Woods testified that such requests were not necessarily uncommon in their relationship. Haywood drove to Mr. Woods’ residence in a black Kia. Brantley was a passenger in the vehicle. Mr. Woods then followed Haywood and Brantley in his red Kia to the Gurley Avenue area of Akron, which is close to the Kimlyn Circle apartments. When they arrived, Brantley and Haywood instructed Mr. Woods to park his vehicle. Haywood and Brantley then drove away. While he sat in his vehicle, Mr. Woods fell asleep. When Mr. Woods awoke, he attempted to call and text the two men but he was unable to reach them. The State presented phone records showing that Haywood received a text message at 2:10 a.m. that stated, ‘Kill both of these niggas.’ (Sic.) The text message was sent from a phone number associated with Brantley. Another text message from the phone number associated with Brantley was sent to Haywood at 2:48 a.m. that stated, ‘I’m bouta shoot Dutch go get da shit and then I’ma kill both des n****** but u got to hurry up so we can get up out of here[.]’ (Sic.) Brantley eventually called Mr. Woods to check if he was still there and if there was anyone else in the area. Brantley and Haywood then jogged to Mr. Woods’ vehicle and got in. Brantley was holding a white t-shirt and a small bag that looked to contain approximately half an ounce of drugs. Mr. Woods was aware that half an ounce of drugs could be worth a substantial sum of money. After Brantley and Haywood got into the vehicle, Mr. Woods heard one of them say, ‘Take it to our grave.’ Mr. Woods did not know who made that statement but he clarified that one of them told him, ‘Take it to our grave or I’ll kill you.’ Mr. Woods specifically heard Brantley say, ‘I doubled back to kill them.’ Although Mr. Woods was not exactly sure about what had transpired, he did not ask any questions. Instead, he transported Brantley and Haywood to Donte’s Game Day bar and then went home. The following morning, Haywood texted Mr. Woods and asked if Mr. Woods had told his cousin about what happened. Mr. Woods responded in the negative. Isaac Love, who had attended the Kimlyn Circle gathering on the evening of April 17, 2013, testified that he placed a call to Mr. Roberts the following morning. An unfamiliar man answered the phone. When Mr. Love called the number a second time, a woman answered the phone. Mr. Love assumed that Ms. Welch had answered the phone. When Mr. Love asked to speak with Mr. Roberts, the woman indicated that he was not around. Mr. Love then inquired as to when Mr. Roberts would return. The woman responded that would never happen. Mr. Love and his wife then drove to the Kimlyn Circle apartments in an attempt to figure out what was going on. The door to Mr. Roberts’ apartment was opened. Mr. Love entered and he ultimately discovered the bodies of Mr. Roberts, Ms. Welch, Mr. Delaney, and Ms. Nash in the basement. Mr. Love notified the police. Cell phone records played a large role in police coming to suspect Brantley and Haywood. Police did not find any cell phones in the basement of the Kimlyn Circle apartment. However, Mr. Roberts’ phone was located in the middle of a street on April 18, 2013, and it was ultimately turned over to police. The last incoming call on Mr. Roberts’ phone around the time of the incident was from a phone associated with Haywood. When police spoke with Haywood, they found that his phone had been reset to its factory setting. Police were able to obtain information about Haywood’s calls and texts through Verizon and it was at that time they learned that he had received two texts about killing people at approximately 2:00 a.m. on April 18, 2013. During a subsequent interview with Brantley, police learned that the texts were sent from a phone associated with him. The mother of Haywood’s child, S.J., attempted to reach Haywood on multiple occasions during the early morning hours of April 18, 2013. S.J. also attempted to reach Brantley and Mr. Woods. Roughly a week after the incident, S.J. sent a text message to Brantley expressing concern that police had Mr. Roberts’ phone, and that Brantley’s number was in his phone. Several days later, S.J. sent another message to Brantley where she suggested that Brantley and Haywood needed to change their phone numbers. With the aid of a software program, police were able to figure out that Brantley deleted a text that he had sent to Haywood that referenced killing people. Police also learned that, on the afternoon of April 18, 2013, Haywood had sent Brantley a screenshot of a news article reporting on the murders. A careful review of the record reveals that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Brantley’s petition. This holds true regardless of whether the trial court applied the materiality standard set forth in Giglio or the materiality standard set forth in Bagley. Even under the more defense-friendly materiality standard set forth in Giglio, Brantley has not demonstrated that there is any reasonable likelihood that Townsend’s false testimony affected the judgment of the jury with respect to either Brantley’s underlying convictions or the sentence imposed. See Giglio, 405 U.S. at 154. While Brantley analogizes the facts of this case to Giglio, we note that Giglio involved a scenario where the prosecution’s case hinged ‘almost entirely’ on the testimony of the witness who gave false testimony about his deal with the prosecution. Id. at 154. By contrast, the State’s case here included an overwhelming amount of circumstantial evidence against Brantley that was independent from Townsend’s testimony. The State’s most compelling evidence against Brantley was not predicated on a finding by the jury that Townsend was credible. While Brantley argues that Townsend was the only witness to place Brantley and Haywood at the scene of the murders, the State presented evidence of cell tower logs that showed Brantley and Haywood were in the vicinity of the Kimlyn Circle apartments around the time of the murders. Mr. Woods testified that he followed Brantley and Haywood to a street in the vicinity of the Kimlyn Circle apartments, where he was ordered to wait. After he received a call from Brantley to make sure nobody was around, Brantley and Haywood returned to Mr. Woods’ vehicle. When Brantley and Haywood entered the vehicle, Mr. Woods heard Brantley say that he ‘doubled back to kill them.’ One of the men threatened Mr. Woods by saying, ‘Take it to our grave or I’ll kill you.’ The State further presented evidence that Brantley sent Haywood two texts that discussed killing people that evening, including one that referenced shooting ‘Dutch[.]’ Under these circumstances, Brantley has not demonstrated that there is any reasonable likelihood that Townsend’s false testimony affected the judgment of the jury with respect to either his convictions or sentence. Accordingly, we cannot say that the trial court’s denial of Brantley’s petition constituted an abuse of discretion.\"\n}\n```"}

In Davis, at issue was a detective’s testimony that the defendant 'was being very deceptive.' Id. at ¶123. The court held that the statement was 'erroneously admitted,' because it 'expressed [the detective’s] opinion that Davis was being untruthful ***.

In other words, Dandridge mischaracterizes this testimony as vouching for the victim’s credibility. Rather, we find that Officer Gilmer is explaining that M.T. was nervous and reluctant to report, as are many victims of sexual abuse, and this explains why she was hesitant to speak with him. Officer Gilmer’s testimony does not render an opinion about the truthfulness of M.T.’s allegations.\\n\\nTurning to Lieut.

In Davis, at issue was a detective’s testimony that the defendant 'was being very deceptive.' Id. at ¶123. The court held that the statement was 'erroneously admitted,' because it 'expressed [the detective’s] opinion that Davis was being untruthful ***.

Merriam-Webster Online, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/forthcoming (accessed Aug. 10, 2021). Apropos to this appeal, we focus on the definition in '2b.'\\n\\nArguably, Lieut. Knack’s testimony could be heard by the jury as offering an opinion regarding J.H.’s credibility based on what he observed during his interviews. However, upon review, we find any error to be harmless.\\n\\nCrim.R. 52(A) defines 'harmless error,' and it states that 'any error, defect, irregularity, or variance which does not affect substantial rights shall be disregarded.' Lieut. Knack’s testimony about his interview with J.H. did not affect Dandridge’s substantial rights.\\n\\nJ.H.’s testimony at trial showed that she was not forthcoming concerning this entire case. The state did not call her as a witness, and in fact, she testified for the defense. J.H. did testify that M.T. disclosed Dandridge’s abuse, along with a timeline, to her. However, J.H. did not directly answer many of the questions Dandridge’s attorney posed on direct examination. For example, asked what she thought when M.T. made the disclosure to her, J.H. answered, 'I didn’t know what to think. I have to go back a little bit now. Now, far as Tone —. * * * Now Antonio, we was okay with Tone. We had no problems with him.” The prosecutor objected stating, 'This isn’t the question that was asked.' Furthermore, on cross-examination, J.H. testified that at the time of trial, she did not'really have a relationship' with her daughter, M.T.\\n\\nAnother example of J.H. not being forthcoming is found in the following testimony:\\n\\nQ: And you did admit to the detective that [M.T.] walked in on you and the defendant having sex, correct?\\n\\nA: Yeah, she walked in on us, yes.\\n\\nQ: And you told her to leave, and the defendant told her to stay, correct?\\n\\nA: Yeah. We weren’t doing anything.\\n\\nQ: I asked you a simple question, ma’am, so please listen to my question. You told the detective that [M.T.] walked in on you and the defendant having sex. You told her to leave and he told her to say. Correct?\\n\\nA: Yes, that’s correct.\\n\\nJ.H.’s hesitancy to be involved in this case was apparent to the jury through her own testimony, and the jury did not need to hear Lieut. Knack’s testimony that J.H. was not forthcoming to reach this conclusion. Additionally, the court gave the following curative instruction to the jury:'so I would ask that you disregard any statements of opinion that you may have heard regarding demeanors of individuals made by Lieutenant Detective Knack.' This court has held that 'curative instructions are presumed to be an effective way to remedy errors that occur during trial.' Parma Hts. v. Owca, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 103606, 2013-Ohio-179, ¶ 37.\\n\\nAccordingly, we find that any error the court committed is harmless. We further find that Dandridge failed to show that he was prejudiced by his counsel’s failure to object to the testimony at issue.\\n\\nDandridge’s first assignment of error is overruled.\"\n}\n```"}

But our review of the record convinces us that the evidence in support of guilt was overwhelming. Contrary to Morrissette’s argument, the surveillance video footage showing him reaching for something at his hip while looking at and walking towards the victim, in the exact area where the shooting took place, seconds before the shooting, was substantial physical evidence connecting him to the murder. And the inference from that footage was corroborated by testimony from multiple credible witnesses. For instance, Taylor testified that he had seen Morrissette shoot Tremble and that Morrissette had asked for help in getting rid of his gun after admitting to shooting Tremble. Admittedly, Taylor had not stepped forward as an eyewitness until he had been arrested on his own charges. But Taylor’s prior experience as a witness adequately explained his reluctance to assist the police. Miller and Cody testified that Morrissette had been “looking for” Tremble when he left their apartment with a gun compatible with the murder weapon minutes before Tremble was shot. And Cody further testified that Morrissette had admitted to shooting Tremble when, as confirmed by the surveillance video footage, Morrissette returned to Cody's apartment building shortly after the shooting. Other testimony supported a finding of guilt. Anderson and Inman both testified that they had heard Morrissette threaten to kill Tremble and admit to shooting him. Tremble's sister Naicha identified Morrissette as the individual she had seen at the crime scene immediately after the shooting. Finally, Morrissette's statements in his recorded phone calls from jail showed a consciousness of guilt. He admitted that he had fled from and concealed himself from the police to avoid apprehension, intended to feign insanity to avoid a long prison sentence for murder, and had tried to distance himself from the nickname Psycho because he knew it would be connected to the shooter.

Crim.R. 33(B) provides that a motion for new trial must be filed within 14 days after the verdict has been rendered, unless a defendant claims the motion was based on the grounds of newly discovered evidence. Additionally, Crim.R. 33(C) requires that a motion under Crim.R. 33 (A)(2) must be sustained by an affidavit showing its truth.\\n\\nA Crim.R. 33 motion for a new trial is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion. State v. Schiebel, 55 Ohio St.3d 71, 77, 564 N.E.2d 54 (1990). ‘The term “abuse of discretion” * * * implies that the court’s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable.’” (Citations omitted.) Blakemore v. Blakemore, 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 450 N.E.2d 1140 (1983), quoting State v. Adams, 62 Ohio St.2d 151, 404 N.E.2d 144 (1980).\\n\\nIn the instant case, Cummings’s motion for new trial was not timely filed as required by Crim.R. 33(B), nor did he seek leave to file his motion properly. In order to obtain leave, a defendant must demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that they were unavoidably prevented from discovering the new evidence within the time period provided by Crim.R. 33(B). A party is ‘unavoidably prevented’ from filing a motion for a new trial if they have ‘no knowledge of the existence of the [evidence or] ground supporting the motion for [a] new trial and [with reasonable diligence,] could not have learned of the existence of that ground within the time prescribed for filing the motion for new trial.’” State v. Sutton, 2016-Ohio-7612, 73 N.E.3d 981, ¶ 12 (8th Dist.), quoting State v. Walden, 19 Ohio App.3d 141, 145-146, 483 N.E.2d 859 (10th Dist.1984). Once the trial court grants leave, the motion for new trial must be filed within seven days, and the motion must be supported by an affidavit demonstrating the existence of the grounds for the motion. Crim.R. 33(B).\\n\\nCummings did not seek leave of the trial court within 14 days after the verdict to file the motion, nor did he include an affidavit demonstrating the existence of the grounds for the motion.4 Rather, Cummings filed his motion for a new trial more than three months after the jury verdict. Nonetheless, the trial court entertained the motion and held a hearing on the matter. At the hearing, the court stated there was ‘good reason’ to consider Cummings’s untimely motion.\\n\\nA review of the record in the instant case reveals defense counsel objected to the jail calls being introduced as evidence at trial. The state did not provide defense counsel with the jail calls until the week of trial. The state explained that the jail calls were not provided until the week of trial because Cummings made ‘numerous, numerous calls’ while he was in jail for the previous seven months. The state further explained that it had to go through all the calls and narrow them down to the calls that were relevant. The state ultimately deemed that three jail calls were relevant. In the last call, the state explained that Cummings was speaking to a relative and goes on to say how the prosecutor’s office is doing everything in its power to railroad him. Cummings states, ‘I know that I did this s * * *[.]’ At that point, the telephone conversation drops. The state’s position was that Cummings was ‘making a full admission that even though he believes [the prosecutor’s] office is railroading him, that he knows he’s in trouble at that point because he did it.’ Defense counsel was not able to review the calls on his personal computer because of software issues. The state offered defense counsel access to a ‘blank computer’ for defense counsel and Cummings to review the calls. The trial court then gave defense counsel as much time as needed to speak with Cummings and review the calls. After a recess, the trial proceeded with the state calling Sergeant Christopher to the stand.\\n\\nMonths later, defense counsel and Cummings reviewed all of the evidence provided by the state, including all the jail call tapes in preparation for Cummings’s other criminal cases. After listening to these tapes, it was discovered that the state never provided defense counsel with a copy of the recorded jail call containing the statement from Cummings that ‘I did this s * * *,’ which was played for the jury at Cummings’s joint trial.\\n\\nDuring the hearing on Cummings’s motion for a new trial, defense counsel argued that because he was able to actually listen to the tapes ‘moments before Sergeant Christopher testified, nothing jumped off the page at me.’ Defense counsel objected to the calls before and after they were played. He did not ‘stand in front of the jury and strenuously object because * * * that [was] a strategic decision on my part. I’m not going to stand there and repeatedly object to the stuff that’s coming in.’ The trial judge asked defense counsel to explain why he did not recognize the calls were different from what he listened to with Cummings and what was played in court.

Crim.R. 33(B) provides that a motion for new trial must be filed within 14 days after the verdict has been rendered, unless a defendant claims the motion was based on the grounds of newly discovered evidence. Additionally, Crim.R. 33(C) requires that a motion under Crim.R. 33 (A)(2) must be sustained by an affidavit showing its truth.\\n\\nA Crim.R. 33 motion for a new trial is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion. State v. Schiebel, 55 Ohio St.3d 71, 77, 564 N.E.2d 54 (1990). ‘The term “abuse of discretion” * * * implies that the court’s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable.’” (Citations omitted.) Blakemore v. Blakemore, 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 450 N.E.2d 1140 (1983), quoting State v. Adams, 62 Ohio St.2d 151, 404 N.E.2d 144 (1980).\\n\\nIn the instant case, Cummings’s motion for new trial was not timely filed as required by Crim.R. 33(B), nor did he seek leave to file his motion properly. In order to obtain leave, a defendant must demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that they were unavoidably prevented from discovering the new evidence within the time period provided by Crim.R. 33(B). A party is ‘unavoidably prevented’ from filing a motion for a new trial if they have ‘no knowledge of the existence of the [evidence or] ground supporting the motion for [a] new trial and [with reasonable diligence,] could not have learned of the existence of that ground within the time prescribed for filing the motion for new trial.’” State v. Sutton, 2016-Ohio-7612, 73 N.E.3d 981, ¶ 12 (8th Dist.), quoting State v. Walden, 19 Ohio App.3d 141, 145-146, 483 N.E.2d 859 (10th Dist.1984). Once the trial court grants leave, the motion for new trial must be filed within seven days, and the motion must be supported by an affidavit demonstrating the existence of the grounds for the motion. Crim.R. 33(B).\\n\\nCummings did not seek leave of the trial court within 14 days after the verdict to file the motion, nor did he include an affidavit demonstrating the existence of the grounds for the motion.4 Rather, Cummings filed his motion for a new trial more than three months after the jury verdict. Nonetheless, the trial court entertained the motion and held a hearing on the matter. At the hearing, the court stated there was ‘good reason’ to consider Cummings’s untimely motion.\\n\\nA review of the record in the instant case reveals defense counsel objected to the jail calls being introduced as evidence at trial. The state did not provide defense counsel with the jail calls until the week of trial. The state explained that the jail calls were not provided until the week of trial because Cummings made ‘numerous, numerous calls’ while he was in jail for the previous seven months. The state further explained that it had to go through all the calls and narrow them down to the calls that were relevant. The state ultimately deemed that three jail calls were relevant. In the last call, the state explained that Cummings was speaking to a relative and goes on to say how the prosecutor’s office is doing everything in its power to railroad him. Cummings states, ‘I know that I did this s * * *[.]’ At that point, the telephone conversation drops. The state’s position was that Cummings was ‘making a full admission that even though he believes [the prosecutor’s] office is railroading him, that he knows he’s in trouble at that point because he did it.’ Defense counsel was not able to review the calls on his personal computer because of software issues. The state offered defense counsel access to a ‘blank computer’ for defense counsel and Cummings to review the calls. The trial court then gave defense counsel as much time as needed to speak with Cummings and review the calls. After a recess, the trial proceeded with the state calling Sergeant Christopher to the stand.\\n\\nMonths later, defense counsel and Cummings reviewed all of the evidence provided by the state, including all the jail call tapes in preparation for Cummings’s other criminal cases. After listening to these tapes, it was discovered that the state never provided defense counsel with a copy of the recorded jail call containing the statement from Cummings that ‘I did this s * * *,’ which was played for the jury at Cummings’s joint trial.\\n\\nDuring the hearing on Cummings’s motion for a new trial, defense counsel argued that because he was able to actually listen to the tapes ‘moments before Sergeant Christopher testified, nothing jumped off the page at me.’ Defense counsel objected to the calls before and after they were played. He did not ‘stand in front of the jury and strenuously object because * * * that [was] a strategic decision on my part. I’m not going to stand there and repeatedly object to the stuff that’s coming in.’ The trial judge asked defense counsel to explain why he did not recognize the calls were different from what he listened to with Cummings and what was played in court. Defense counsel explained that he was preparing for five cases, which were serious. There was a multitude of discovery in these cases. He knew at trial that the state’s intention was to play them.\\n\\nThe state acknowledged upon checking the disc that was provided to defense counsel at trial, that the disc did not contain the correct jail call. The state reiterated that, at trial, it advised defense counsel the significance of the jail calls.

THOMAS THAT WERE REQUESTED IN HIS DEMAND FOR DISCOVERY.", "discussion": "```json\n{\n  \"discussion\": \"Appellant argues that the trial court failed to grant a mistrial or impose a sanction when the prosecution elicited testimony from witnesses regarding statements made by Appellant, where these statements were not provided to the defense in its demand for discovery. We note that in his brief, Appellant cites to the wrong version of the criminal rule on which he relies. The correct version of Crim.R. 16(B) requires prosecuting attorneys to provide copies or photographs of certain information to the defense provided that the defense makes a written demand for discovery. Specifically, Crim.R. 16(B)(1), (5), and (7) provide that, following such a demand, the prosecution must provide: (1) Any written or recorded statement by the defendant or a co-defendant, including police summaries of such statements * * * (5) Any evidence favorable to the defendant and material to guilt or punishment; * * * (7) Any written or recorded statement by a witness in the state’s case-in-chief, or that it reasonably anticipates calling as a witness in rebuttal. The rule specifically refers to discoverable evidence that is written or recorded. Other courts have determined that, ‘[a] writing or recording is only a statement for purposes of Crim.R. 16 if the witness prepared, signed, or adopted the statement; or if it is a substantially verbatim recital of the witness’s statement written in a continuous, narrative form.’ State v. Scoggins, 4th Dist. No. 16CA3767, 2017-Ohio-8989, ¶ 38; State v. Cunningham, 105 Ohio St.3d 197, 2004-Ohio-7007, 824 N.E.2d 504, ¶ 44; State v. Phillips, 4th Dist. Nos. 89-CA-32 & 89 CA-33, 1992 WL 42790, *5 (Mar. 5, 1992); State v. Johnson, 62 Ohio App.2d 31, 403 N.E.2d 1003 (6th Dist.1978), paragraph one of the syllabus; State v. Moore, 74 Ohio App.3d 334, 340, 598 N.E.2d 1224 (10th Dist.1991). Appellant argues that there were four different witness statements made at trial that were not disclosed after his demand for discovery, in violation of Crim.R. 16. The first is a statement made by Mrs. Thomas, who testified that during the attack Appellant said ‘[i]f you call the cops, I am going to kill you.’ (Tr., p. 398.) The second was made by his youngest daughter, Teri Thomas, who testified Appellant stated that he was ‘going to put [Mrs. Thomas] in the ICU * * * [Mrs. Thomas] [will] suffer before they get a divorce.’ (Tr., p. 324.) The third was made by his daughter-in-law, Taylor Thomas, who testified that on the way to the hospital Appellant said ‘[t]hat he was really, really sorry, and he didn’t mean what he did.’ (Tr., p. 289.) The final statement was made by Brittany Higgs, Appellant’s oldest daughter, who stated that while checking Appellant into the psychiatric facility at the hospital, Appellant was asked what had brought him to the facility. Higgs testified that Appellant responded, ‘[w]ell, I guess I’m crazy, because I tried to drown my wife in the bathtub.’ (Tr., p. 576.) Appellant argues that these oral statements witnesses testified were made by him were discoverable evidence pursuant to Crim.R. 16 and that failure to provide them prior to trial amounted to prejudicial error, warranting mistrial or other sanction. This argument is meritless given the actual language and intent of the rule. The testimony in question was made by witnesses whose names and addresses were indisputably disclosed. The relevant provisions of Crim.R. 16(B) explicitly state that the kind and quality of discoverable evidence the rule is concerned with is that which is written or recorded, or is ‘favorable to the defendant and material to guilt or punishment.’ It is clear that these statements were not favorable to Appellant, so they fail to meet this prong of the statute. Regardless, the statements in question were volunteered by the witnesses at trial. They had not previously been written or recorded. As such, the statements do not meet the requirements necessary in order to be considered a discoverable statement pursuant to Crim.R. 16: they were not written or recorded; were not prepared, signed, or adopted by the witness; nor were they verbatim recitals written in continuous, narrative form. Scoggins, supra. Appellant argues that Crim.R. 16 is violated when the state fails to compile and provide a written summary of any oral statement that may have been made. This argument is based on 1994 caselaw and relies on a version of the law that is no longer valid. Even under the outdated version of Crim.R. 16, the statements that were required to be compiled and provided in written form were oral statements made by a defendant to a prosecutor or law enforcement official. The statements Appellant complains of in this case were made by Appellant, but were not made to a prosecutor or law enforcement official. Rather, these statements were made to his relatives and to hospital personnel. Even under the former version of the rule these statements would not have been required to be summarized and given to Appellant. We have held that ‘Crim.R. 16 does not mandate the pretrial discovery of witness statements.’ State v. McKinnon, 7th Dist. No. 09 CO 17, 2010-Ohio-2145, ¶ 16. The Sixth District further clarified that ‘[a]lthough the rule requires the state to disclose witnesses' statements, it does not require the state to reduce interviews with potential witnesses to writing.’ State v. Clark, 6th Dist. No. L-17-1044, 2018-Ohio-521, ¶ 38; State v. Jackson, 9th Dist. No. 27739, 2017-Ohio-278, ¶ 11, 81 N.E.3d 942. Moreover, a prosecutor's notes of his discussions with witnesses are protected under Crim.R. 16 as work product. Scoggins, supra, at ¶ 38; State v. Henry, 37 Ohio App.3d 3, 523 N.E.2d 877 (6th Dist.1987), paragraph three of the syllabus. These holdings underscore that the state does not owe a duty to record or make a written summary of oral statements made by witnesses, but merely to provide recorded or written statements if these were otherwise recorded or written in the course of the investigation and do not amount to attorney work product. Even if we were to assume, arguendo, that the state's failure to disclose oral statements made by Appellant to witnesses is, in fact, a Crim.R. 16 violation, we would still conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying the motion for mistrial or by failing to impose a sanction. The Ohio Supreme Court has held a violation of Crim.R. 16 constitutes reversible error ‘only when there is a showing that (1) the prosecution's failure to disclose was a willful violation of the rule, (2) foreknowledge of the information would have benefited the accused in the preparation of his defense, and (3) the accused suffered some prejudicial effect.’ State v. Joseph, 73 Ohio St.3d 450, 458, 653 N.E.2d 285 (1995), citing State v. Parson, 6 Ohio St.3d 442, 445, 453 N.E.2d 689 (1983). The court in State v. Litton, 12th Dist. No. CA2016-04-005, 2016-Ohio-7913, ¶ 11, citing State v. Bowshier, 2d Dist. No. 06-CA-41, 2007-Ohio-5364, ¶ 31 has defined willful as ‘intent, purpose or design to injure.’ Appellant argues that nondisclosure was willful because the prosecutor knowingly elicited witness testimony in his case-in-chief that contained the testimony Appellant alleges were prejudicial. The state contends Appellant failed to demonstrate any willful conduct on the part of the prosecution. Moreover, as noted by the state, Appellant does not argue that the state failed to provide written witness statements during discovery, but that the witnesses’ live testimony at trial contained additional statements made by Appellant, and these could be seen as prejudicial. The state contends Appellant did not object to the statements at trial. A review of the transcripts reveals that while Appellant never objected to any of the four statements made by the four separate witnesses at the time they were made, he did raise an objection the next trial day. Regardless, Appellant’s contention about the witnesses’ trial testimony is misplaced. As noted, Crim.R. 16 serves as a protection against the state willfully withholding prepared written statements that are favorable to the defendant and material to the issue of guilt or innocence. Appellant received prepared, written witness statements prior to trial. The statements at issue here were made by the state’s witnesses during trial and which did not appear in their prepared statements. Appellant does not claim that the state deliberately hid the statements, or even knew that they would be made during trial. Moreover, Appellant did not lodge an immediate objection to the statements when they were uttered, instead allowing the direct testimony to proceed unfettered until the next day, when the issue was raised during a bench conference. If Appellant never made these statements to or in front of the witnesses, as he contends, he had an opportunity to cross-examine each witness, utilizing their written statements (that did not include the disputed remarks) to impeach their direct testimony. He did not attempt such an impeachment. Based on the criminal rule, the prosecutor's failure to disclose the oral statements made by the defendant to or in front of various witnesses is far from willful. The state was not under a duty to disclose these oral statements or compile and provide written summaries of statements not otherwise recorded. We note that there is no evidence of record that the state was aware of these statements made by Appellant to the witnesses prior to their trial testimony. Assuming the witnesses may have disclosed them to the prosecutor, they would be protected as work product. Ultimately, assuming we could find that the state's conduct was willful and defense counsel may have benefited from disclosure of the disputed statements when preparing Appellant's defense, the statements were not so prejudicial as to deny Appellant a fair trial and warrant a mistrial. As the record is replete with evidence of Appellant's conduct on the day in question from multiple witnesses, the disputed statements are not likely to have deprived Appellant of a fair trial. Regarding Appellant's claim that the trial court abused its discretion in failing to impose a sanction, this argument is also meritless. ‘Imposition of discovery sanctions is discretionary, and we review the trial court's decision for an abuse of discretion.’ Clark, supra, at ¶ 37; State v. Darmond, 135 Ohio St.3d 343, 2013-Ohio-966, 986 N.E.2d 971, ¶ 20, 33. Abuse of discretion in this case means that the trial court’s decision was unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. Blakemore v. Blakemore, 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 450 N.E.2d 1140 (1983); State v. Clark, 6th Dist. No. L-17-1044, 2018-Ohio-521, ¶ 37 citing State ex rel. Askew v. Goldhart, 75 Ohio St.3d 608, 610, 665 N.E.2d 200 (1996). Crim.R. 16(L)(1) dictates regulation of discovery and states: ‘The trial court may make orders regulating discovery not inconsistent with this rule. If at any time during the course of the proceedings it is brought to the attention of the court that a party has failed to comply with this rule or with an order issued pursuant to this rule, the court may order such party to permit the discovery or inspection, grant a continuance, or prohibit the party from introducing in evidence the material not disclosed, or it may make such other order as it deems just under the circumstances.’ This record shows the state did not run afoul of the discovery rules. The trial court here was correct in overruling the motion to dismiss and in permitting the statements to be heard through witness testimony. Even if the state had failed to turn over discoverable statements, the court was well within the realm of discretion in permitting the testimony because it falls within the broad discretion granted to the court under Crim.R. 16(L)(1). For the reasons set forth above Appellant’s first assignment of error is without merit and is overruled.\"\n}\n```"}

THOMAS A FAIR TRIAL.", "discussion": "```json\n{\n  \"discussion\": \"Appellant argues that the trial court failed to grant a mistrial or impose a sanction when the prosecution elicited testimony from witnesses regarding statements made by Appellant, where these statements were not provided to the defense in its demand for discovery. We note that in his brief, Appellant cites to the wrong version of the criminal rule on which he relies. The correct version of Crim.R. 16(B) requires prosecuting attorneys to provide copies or photographs of certain information to the defense provided that the defense makes a written demand for discovery. Specifically, Crim.R. 16(B)(1), (5), and (7) provide that, following such a demand, the prosecution must provide: (1) Any written or recorded statement by the defendant or a co-defendant, including police summaries of such statements * * * (5) Any evidence favorable to the defendant and material to guilt or punishment; * * * (7) Any written or recorded statement by a witness in the state’s case-in-chief, or that it reasonably anticipates calling as a witness in rebuttal. The rule specifically refers to discoverable evidence that is written or recorded. Other courts have determined that, ‘[a] writing or recording is only a statement for purposes of Crim.R. 16 if the witness prepared, signed, or adopted the statement; or if it is a substantially verbatim recital of the witness’s statement written in a continuous, narrative form.’ State v. Scoggins, 4th Dist. No. 16CA3767, 2017-Ohio-8989, ¶ 38; State v. Cunningham, 105 Ohio St.3d 197, 2004-Ohio-7007, 824 N.E.2d 504, ¶ 44; State v. Phillips, 4th Dist. Nos. 89-CA-32 & 89 CA-33, 1992 WL 42790, *5 (Mar. 5, 1992); State v. Johnson, 62 Ohio App.2d 31, 403 N.E.2d 1003 (6th Dist.1978), paragraph one of the syllabus; State v. Moore, 74 Ohio App.3d 334, 340, 598 N.E.2d 1224 (10th Dist.1991). Appellant argues that there were four different witness statements made at trial that were not disclosed after his demand for discovery, in violation of Crim.R. 16. The first is a statement made by Mrs. Thomas, who testified that during the attack Appellant said ‘[i]f you call the cops, I am going to kill you.’ (Tr., p. 398.) The second was made by his youngest daughter, Teri Thomas, who testified Appellant stated that he was ‘going to put [Mrs. Thomas] in the ICU * * * [Mrs. Thomas] [will] suffer before they get a divorce.’ (Tr., p. 324.) The third was made by his daughter-in-law, Taylor Thomas, who testified that on the way to the hospital Appellant said ‘[t]hat he was really, really sorry, and he didn’t mean what he did.’ (Tr., p. 289.) The final statement was made by Brittany Higgs, Appellant’s oldest daughter, who stated that while checking Appellant into the psychiatric facility at the hospital, Appellant was asked what had brought him to the facility. Higgs testified that Appellant responded, ‘[w]ell, I guess I’m crazy, because I tried to drown my wife in the bathtub.’ (Tr., p. 576.) Appellant argues that these oral statements witnesses testified were made by him were discoverable evidence pursuant to Crim.R. 16 and that failure to provide them prior to trial amounted to prejudicial error, warranting mistrial or other sanction. This argument is meritless given the actual language and intent of the rule. The testimony in question was made by witnesses whose names and addresses were indisputably disclosed. The relevant provisions of Crim.R. 16(B) explicitly state that the kind and quality of discoverable evidence the rule is concerned with is that which is written or recorded, or is ‘favorable to the defendant and material to guilt or punishment.’ It is clear that these statements were not favorable to Appellant, so they fail to meet this prong of the statute. Regardless, the statements in question were volunteered by the witnesses at trial. They had not previously been written or recorded. As such, the statements do not meet the requirements necessary in order to be considered a discoverable statement pursuant to Crim.R. 16: they were not written or recorded; were not prepared, signed, or adopted by the witness; nor were they verbatim recitals written in continuous, narrative form. Scoggins, supra. Appellant argues that Crim.R. 16 is violated when the state fails to compile and provide a written summary of any oral statement that may have been made. This argument is based on 1994 caselaw and relies on a version of the law that is no longer valid. Even under the outdated version of Crim.R. 16, the statements that were required to be compiled and provided in written form were oral statements made by a defendant to a prosecutor or law enforcement official. The statements Appellant complains of in this case were made by Appellant, but were not made to a prosecutor or law enforcement official. Rather, these statements were made to his relatives and to hospital personnel. Even under the former version of the rule these statements would not have been required to be summarized and given to Appellant. We have held that ‘Crim.R. 16 does not mandate the pretrial discovery of witness statements.’ State v. McKinnon, 7th Dist. No. 09 CO 17, 2010-Ohio-2145, ¶ 16. The Sixth District further clarified that ‘[a]lthough the rule requires the state to disclose witnesses' statements, it does not require the state to reduce interviews with potential witnesses to writing.’ State v. Clark, 6th Dist. No. L-17-1044, 2018-Ohio-521, ¶ 38; State v. Jackson, 9th Dist. No. 27739, 2017-Ohio-278, ¶ 11, 81 N.E.3d 942. Moreover, a prosecutor's notes of his discussions with witnesses are protected under Crim.R. 16 as work product. Scoggins, supra, at ¶ 38; State v. Henry, 37 Ohio App.3d 3, 523 N.E.2d 877 (6th Dist.1987), paragraph three of the syllabus. These holdings underscore that the state does not owe a duty to record or make a written summary of oral statements made by witnesses, but merely to provide recorded or written statements if these were otherwise recorded or written in the course of the investigation and do not amount to attorney work product. Even if we were to assume, arguendo, that the state's failure to disclose oral statements made by Appellant to witnesses is, in fact, a Crim.R. 16 violation, we would still conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying the motion for mistrial or by failing to impose a sanction. The Ohio Supreme Court has held a violation of Crim.R. 16 constitutes reversible error ‘only when there is a showing that (1) the prosecution's failure to disclose was a willful violation of the rule, (2) foreknowledge of the information would have benefited the accused in the preparation of his defense, and (3) the accused suffered some prejudicial effect.’ State v. Joseph, 73 Ohio St.3d 450, 458, 653 N.E.2d 285 (1995), citing State v. Parson, 6 Ohio St.3d 442, 445, 453 N.E.2d 689 (1983). The court in State v. Litton, 12th Dist. No. CA2016-04-005, 2016-Ohio-7913, ¶ 11, citing State v. Bowshier, 2d Dist. No. 06-CA-41, 2007-Ohio-5364, ¶ 31 has defined willful as ‘intent, purpose or design to injure.’ Appellant argues that nondisclosure was willful because the prosecutor knowingly elicited witness testimony in his case-in-chief that contained the testimony Appellant alleges were prejudicial. The state contends Appellant failed to demonstrate any willful conduct on the part of the prosecution. Moreover, as noted by the state, Appellant does not argue that the state failed to provide written witness statements during discovery, but that the witnesses’ live testimony at trial contained additional statements made by Appellant, and these could be seen as prejudicial. The state contends Appellant did not object to the statements at trial. A review of the transcripts reveals that while Appellant never objected to any of the four statements made by the four separate witnesses at the time they were made, he did raise an objection the next trial day. Regardless, Appellant’s contention about the witnesses’ trial testimony is misplaced. As noted, Crim.R. 16 serves as a protection against the state willfully withholding prepared written statements that are favorable to the defendant and material to the issue of guilt or innocence. Appellant received prepared, written witness statements prior to trial. The statements at issue here were made by the state’s witnesses during trial and which did not appear in their prepared statements. Appellant does not claim that the state deliberately hid the statements, or even knew that they would be made during trial. Moreover, Appellant did not lodge an immediate objection to the statements when they were uttered, instead allowing the direct testimony to proceed unfettered until the next day, when the issue was raised during a bench conference. If Appellant never made these statements to or in front of the witnesses, as he contends, he had an opportunity to cross-examine each witness, utilizing their written statements (that did not include the disputed remarks) to impeach their direct testimony. He did not attempt such an impeachment. Based on the criminal rule, the prosecutor's failure to disclose the oral statements made by the defendant to or in front of various witnesses is far from willful. The state was not under a duty to disclose these oral statements or compile and provide written summaries of statements not otherwise recorded. We note that there is no evidence of record that the state was aware of these statements made by Appellant to the witnesses prior to their trial testimony. Assuming the witnesses may have disclosed them to the prosecutor, they would be protected as work product. Ultimately, assuming we could find that the state's conduct was willful and defense counsel may have benefited from disclosure of the disputed statements when preparing Appellant's defense, the statements were not so prejudicial as to deny Appellant a fair trial and warrant a mistrial. As the record is replete with evidence of Appellant's conduct on the day in question from multiple witnesses, the disputed statements are not likely to have deprived Appellant of a fair trial. Regarding Appellant's claim that the trial court abused its discretion in failing to impose a sanction, this argument is also meritless. ‘Imposition of discovery sanctions is discretionary, and we review the trial court's decision for an abuse of discretion.’ Clark, supra, at ¶ 37; State v. Darmond, 135 Ohio St.3d 343, 2013-Ohio-966, 986 N.E.2d 971, ¶ 20, 33. Abuse of discretion in this case means that the trial court’s decision was unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. Blakemore v. Blakemore, 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 450 N.E.2d 1140 (1983); State v. Clark, 6th Dist. No. L-17-1044, 2018-Ohio-521, ¶ 37 citing State ex rel. Askew v. Goldhart, 75 Ohio St.3d 608, 610, 665 N.E.2d 200 (1996). Crim.R. 16(L)(1) dictates regulation of discovery and states: ‘The trial court may make orders regulating discovery not inconsistent with this rule. If at any time during the course of the proceedings it is brought to the attention of the court that a party has failed to comply with this rule or with an order issued pursuant to this rule, the court may order such party to permit the discovery or inspection, grant a continuance, or prohibit the party from introducing in evidence the material not disclosed, or it may make such other order as it deems just under the circumstances.’ This record shows the state did not run afoul of the discovery rules.

To prevail on an ineffective-assistance claim, an appellant must demonstrate that: (1) counsel’s performance was deficient, and (2) counsel’s deficient performance prejudiced the defense. *Strickland v. Washington*, 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984); *State v. Bradley*, 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 141-142, 538 N.E.2d 373 (1989).\\n\\nIn reviewing defense counsel’s performance, we must remain highly deferential. *Strickland* at 689. We must “recognize that counsel is strongly presumed to have rendered adequate assistance and made all significant decisions in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment.” *Id.* at 690.\\n\\nAn appellant’s demonstration that counsel’s performance was deficient does not warrant the reversal of a conviction if counsel’s error had no effect on the judgment. *Id.* at 691; *Bradley* at 142. The appellant must affirmatively demonstrate that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s deficient performance, the result of the trial would have been different. *Strickland* at 693-694; *Bradley* at 143.\\n\\n{¶34} **A. Failure to hire a forensic pathology expert.** Pennington first asserts that defense counsel’s performance was deficient because counsel failed to request funds for or hire a forensic pathology expert to contradict the opinion of the state’s forensic pathology expert, Dr. Stephens.\\n\\n{¶35} Generally, the decision whether to call any witness “falls within the rubric of trial strategy and will not be second-guessed by a reviewing court.” *State v. Treesh*, 90 Ohio St.3d 460, 490, 739 N.E.2d 749 (2001). A decision by defense counsel not to call an expert witness and instead rely on cross-examination of the state’s expert is generally a matter of trial strategy and does not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. *State v. Hunter*, 131 Ohio St.3d 67, 2011-Ohio-6524, 960 N.E.2d 955, ¶ 66; *State v. Mundt*, 115 Ohio St.3d 22, 2007-Ohio-4836, 873 N.E.2d 828, ¶ 118; *State v. McHenry*, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-170671, 2018-Ohio-3383, ¶ 25.\\n\\n{¶36} Here, trial counsel conducted a thorough and rigorous cross-examination of the state’s expert, attacking her opinion that the manner of death was homicide, and leading her to concede that there was a chance, albeit slim, that the victim had shot herself. We conclude that defense counsel’s decision not to hire or call a forensic pathology expert fell “within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.” *See State v. Thompson*, 141 Ohio St.3d 254, 2014-Ohio-4751, 23 N.E.3d 1096, ¶ 244, quoting *Strickland*, 466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674.\\n\\n{¶37} Pennington directs us to *Hinton v. Alabama*, 571 U.S. 263, 274-275, 134 S.Ct. 1081, 188 L.Ed.2d 1 (2014), where the United States Supreme Court held that trial counsel had rendered deficient performance by employing an expert he knew to be inadequate because he failed to understand the resources that state law made available to him. However, *Hinton* involved a postconviction proceeding where the defendant produced evidence outside the trial record, including the affidavits of three experts who had reached different conclusions than the state’s experts. See id. at 270.\\n\\n{¶38} In this case, on the other hand, Pennington cannot establish prejudice based on the record before us. Resolving this issue in Pennington’s favor would be purely speculative. See State v. Madrigal, 87 Ohio St.3d 378, 390, 721 N.E.2d 52 (2000). Nothing in the record indicates that testimony from another forensic pathologist would have been favorable to Pennington and would have altered the outcome of the trial. See id. at 390-391; Mundt at ¶ 118; State v. Jeffries, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-170182, 2018-Ohio-2160, ¶ 78-79. “Establishing that would require proof outside the record, such as affidavits demonstrating the probable testimony. Such a claim is not appropriately considered on a direct appeal.” Madrigal at 391. Therefore, even assuming that counsel’s failure to obtain a forensic pathology expert was deficient, Pennington has failed to demonstrate any resulting prejudice.\\n\\n{¶39} B. Failure to discover that the handgun model was defective. Pennington also argues that counsel should have discovered that the model of handgun that caused Herald’s injuries, a Taurus PT111 Millennium, was defective and had been the subject of a Florida class-action lawsuit that alleged defects with the handgun’s firing. He asserts that information regarding the defects in the Taurus handguns was “widely publicized,” citing a court order that approved a class-action settlement in the Florida case. See Carter v.

As we have stated, we are unable to determine on appeal whether ineffective assistance of counsel occurred where the allegations of ineffectiveness are based on facts not appearing in the record. See State v. Cooperrider, 4 Ohio St.3d 226, 228, 448 C. Failure to subpoena the victim’s mother. Pennington contends that defense counsel should have subpoenaed Herald’s mother to testify at trial because she had made statements that caused the police to investigate the possibility that Herald had previously attempted suicide.\\n\\nWe will not second-guess counsel’s decision not to call any witness because that is a matter squarely within the ambit of trial strategy. See Treesh, 90 Ohio St.3d at 490, 739 N.E.2d 749. It is possible that defense counsel interviewed Herald’s mother and decided that her testimony would not be favorable to Pennington. Moreover, although Pennington claims that testimony by Herald’s mother may have been favorable to his defense, there is nothing in the record to support that assertion. Therefore, we cannot say that Pennington was prejudiced by counsel’s decision not to call Herald’s mother as a witness. And we note that defense counsel was able to get into evidence the officer’s testimony about a possible prior suicide attempt.\\n\\nD. Failure to advise a pretrial guilty plea to the weapons-under-disability count. Finally, Pennington contends that trial counsel should have advised him to enter a guilty plea to the weapons charge prior to trial to prevent the state from introducing into evidence the shotgun, shotgun shells, and certain ammunition that was not compatible with the shotgun or with the handgun that caused Herald’s injuries. He claims that the evidence was relevant only to the weapons charge and would not have been admissible at trial if he had entered the plea beforehand.\\n\\nPennington has not demonstrated that counsel’s performance was deficient, or that but for counsel’s deficient performance, the result of the bench trial would have been different.\"\n}\n```"}

{"Index": "137-Richey", "allegation_num": "allegation_1", "allegation": "THE TRIAL COURT ERRED WHEN IT DENIED DEFENDANT-APPELLANT'S CRIMINAL RULE 29 MOTION FOR ACQUITTAL.", "discussion": "```json\n{\n  \"discussion\": \"In his first assignment of error, appellant asserts the trial court erred in denying his motion for acquittal under Crim.R. 29. A motion for acquittal under Crim.R. 29 attacks the sufficiency of the evidence. Therefore, in reviewing whether the trial court erred in denying a motion for acquittal under Crim.R. 29, we apply the same standard used to review a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence. Sufficiency of the evidence is a legal standard that tests whether the evidence is adequate to sustain a verdict as a matter of law. In reviewing a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, an appellate court must determine 'whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.' Where the evidence, 'if believed, would convince the average mind of the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt,' it is sufficient to sustain a conviction. 'The testimony of a single witness, if believed by the finder of fact, is sufficient to support a criminal conviction.' With regard to the firearm specifications attached to each charge except for the charge of having weapons while under disability, appellant argues the state did not present sufficient evidence to support the specifications because 'the police did not find a firearm on [appellant] or anywhere in the house where he was living [and] [n]o gun was admitted into evidence.' J.H. testified appellant pointed his gun at and shot Flannery. Carroll testified appellant stated he was 'about to shoot' Flannery; immediately after, Carroll heard a bang. Based on this testimony, there was sufficient evidence to support the firearm specifications. Appellant contends the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to convict him of kidnapping, aggravated robbery, aggravated murder, murder, and having weapons while under disability. With the exception of the firearm specifications, as previously discussed, appellant does not provide separate arguments, with citation to either the record or caselaw, in support of his contention that his convictions were not supported by sufficient evidence. Instead, appellant makes a consolidated argument challenging the witnesses' credibility. Specifically, appellant argues there were no independent eyewitnesses who identified him as the shooter, there was no physical evidence at the crime scene tying him to the incident, and '[t]he only evidence that links [appellant] to these crimes is the testimony of his alleged co-defendants, who each got significant deals from the state by testifying.' Thus, although appellant frames his assignment of error in terms of sufficiency of the evidence, appellant's contentions actually address the manifest weight of the evidence. Therefore, appellant's arguments regarding the credibility of the witnesses are more appropriately considered in our analysis of his second assignment of error. Nevertheless, we examine whether appellant's convictions for kidnapping, aggravated robbery, aggravated murder, murder, and having weapons while under disability were supported by sufficient evidence. Pursuant to R.C. 2905.01, a person is guilty of kidnapping if the person 'by force, threat, or deception * * * remove[d] another from the place where the other person is found or restrain[ed] the liberty of the other person' for the purpose of 'facilitat[ed] the commission of any felony.' Here, J.H. testified appellant restrained Flannery's liberty by pointing a gun at him and ordering him to move to the backyard. Carroll also testified appellant ordered Flannery to move to the backyard. Based on the testimony at trial, we find appellant's conviction for kidnapping was supported by sufficient evidence. Pursuant to R.C. 2911.01(A)(1), a person is guilty of aggravated robbery if the person 'in attempting or committing a theft offense, as defined in section 2913.01 of the Revised Code, or in fleeing immediately after the attempt or offense [had] a deadly weapon on or about the offender's person or under the offender's control and either display[ed] the weapon, brandish[ed] it, indicate[d] that the offender possesse[d] it, or use[d] it.' Pursuant to R.C. 2913.01(K)(1), 'theft offense' includes a violation of R.C. 2913.02, namely theft. R.C. 2913.02 provides that a person is guilty of theft when the person 'with purpose to deprive the owner of property or services, * * * knowingly obtain[ed] or exert[ed] control over either the property or services * * * [w]ithout the consent of the owner or person authorized to give consent.' 'Deadly weapon' is defined in R.C. 2923.11 as 'any instrument, device, or thing capable of inflicting death, and designed or specially adapted for use as a weapon, or possessed, carried, or used as a weapon.' Here, J.H. testified appellant pointed a gun at Flannery and demanded Flannery step off the porch. Carroll testified he and appellant planned to rob a pizza delivery driver. According to Carroll, appellant told Flannery, 'You know what time it is,' which, according to Carroll, meant this was a robbery. Carroll testified he took money from Flannery, while J.H. took the pizzas. Based on the testimony at trial, we find appellant's conviction for aggravated robbery was supported by sufficient evidence. R.C. 2903.01 provides in pertinent part that a person is guilty of murder if that person 'purposely cause[d] the death of another *** while committing or attempting to commit, or while fleeing immediately after committing or attempting to commit, kidnapping [or] aggravated robbery.' Pursuant to R.C. 2903.02, a person is guilty of murder if the person 'purposely cause[d] the death of another.' J.H. testified he witnessed appellant shoot Flannery after holding him at gunpoint. Carroll testified appellant told him, 'Watch out, Cuz. I'm about to shoot him.' Carroll moved out of the way and then heard a bang. This testimony, when considered in conjunction with the testimony relating to kidnapping and aggravated robbery, was sufficient to support appellant's conviction for aggravated murder and murder. R.C. 2923.13 provides, in pertinent part, that unless relieved from disability, 'no person shall knowingly acquire, have, carry, or use any firearm or dangerous ordnance, if *** [t]he person *** has been convicted of any felony offense of violence or has been adjudicated a delinquent child for the commission of an offense that, if committed by an adult, would have been a felony offense of violence.' Here, appellant stipulated to his prior record for purposes of the charge of having weapons while under disability. Based on this stipulation combined with the evidence presented at trial, we find sufficient evidence supported appellant’s conviction for having weapons while under disability. Therefore, having found the state presented sufficient evidence to support appellant’s convictions, we overrule appellant’s first assignment of error.\"\n}\n```"}

Nevertheless, we examine whether appellant's convictions for kidnapping, aggravated robbery, aggravated murder, murder, and having weapons while under disability were supported by sufficient evidence. Pursuant to R.C. 2905.01, a person is guilty of kidnapping if the person 'by force, threat, or deception * * * remove[d] another from the place where the other person is found or restrain[ed] the liberty of the other person' for the purpose of 'facilitat[ed] the commission of any felony.' Here, J.H. testified appellant restrained Flannery's liberty by pointing a gun at him and ordering him to move to the backyard. Carroll also testified appellant ordered Flannery to move to the backyard. Based on the testimony at trial, we find appellant's conviction for kidnapping was supported by sufficient evidence. Pursuant to R.C. 2911.01(A)(1), a person is guilty of aggravated robbery if the person 'in attempting or committing a theft offense, as defined in section 2913.01 of the Revised Code, or in fleeing immediately after the attempt or offense [had] a deadly weapon on or about the offender's person or under the offender's control and either display[ed] the weapon, brandish[ed] it, indicate[d] that the offender possesse[d] it, or use[d] it.' Pursuant to R.C. 2913.01(K)(1), 'theft offense' includes a violation of R.C. 2913.02, namely theft. R.C. 2913.02 provides that a person is guilty of theft when the person 'with purpose to deprive the owner of property or services, * * * knowingly obtain[ed] or exert[ed] control over either the property or services * * * [w]ithout the consent of the owner or person authorized to give consent.' 'Deadly weapon' is defined in R.C. 2923.11 as 'any instrument, device, or thing capable of inflicting death, and designed or specially adapted for use as a weapon, or possessed, carried, or used as a weapon.' Here, J.H. testified appellant pointed a gun at Flannery and demanded Flannery step off the porch. Carroll testified he and appellant planned to rob a pizza delivery driver. According to Carroll, appellant told Flannery, 'You know what time it is,' which, according to Carroll, meant this was a robbery. Carroll testified he took money from Flannery, while J.H. took the pizzas. Based on the testimony at trial, we find appellant's conviction for aggravated robbery was supported by sufficient evidence. R.C. 2903.01 provides in pertinent part that a person is guilty of murder if that person 'purposely cause[d] the death of another *** while committing or attempting to commit, or while fleeing immediately after committing or attempting to commit, kidnapping [or] aggravated robbery.' Pursuant to R.C. 2903.02, a person is guilty of murder if the person 'purposely cause[d] the death of another.' J.H. testified he witnessed appellant shoot Flannery after holding him at gunpoint. Carroll testified appellant told him, 'Watch out, Cuz. I'm about to shoot him.' Carroll moved out of the way and then heard a bang. This testimony, when considered in conjunction with the testimony relating to kidnapping and aggravated robbery, was sufficient to support appellant's conviction for aggravated murder and murder. R.C. 2923.13 provides, in pertinent part, that unless relieved from disability, 'no person shall knowingly acquire, have, carry, or use any firearm or dangerous ordnance, if *** [t]he person *** has been convicted of any felony offense of violence or has been adjudicated a delinquent child for the commission of an offense that, if committed by an adult, would have been a felony offense of violence.' Here, appellant stipulated to his prior record for purposes of the charge of having weapons while under disability. Based on this stipulation combined with the evidence presented at trial, we find sufficient evidence supported appellant’s conviction for having weapons while under disability. Therefore, having found the state presented sufficient evidence to support appellant’s convictions, we overrule appellant’s first assignment of error.\"\n}\n```"}

A motion for acquittal under Crim.R. 29 attacks the sufficiency of the evidence. Therefore, in reviewing whether the trial court erred in denying a motion for acquittal under Crim.R. 29, we apply the same standard used to review a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence. Sufficiency of the evidence is a legal standard that tests whether the evidence is adequate to sustain a verdict as a matter of law. In reviewing a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, an appellate court must determine 'whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.' Where the evidence, 'if believed, would convince the average mind of the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt,' it is sufficient to sustain a conviction. 'The testimony of a single witness, if believed by the finder of fact, is sufficient to support a criminal conviction.' With regard to the firearm specifications attached to each charge except for the charge of having weapons while under disability, appellant argues the state did not present sufficient evidence to support the specifications because 'the police did not find a firearm on [appellant] or anywhere in the house where he was living [and] [n]o gun was admitted into evidence.' J.H. testified appellant pointed his gun at and shot Flannery. Carroll testified appellant stated he was 'about to shoot' Flannery; immediately after, Carroll heard a bang. Based on this testimony, there was sufficient evidence to support the firearm specifications. Appellant contends the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to convict him of kidnapping, aggravated robbery, aggravated murder, murder, and having weapons while under disability. With the exception of the firearm specifications, as previously discussed, appellant does not provide separate arguments, with citation to either the record or caselaw, in support of his contention that his convictions were not supported by sufficient evidence. Instead, appellant makes a consolidated argument challenging the witnesses' credibility. Specifically, appellant argues there were no independent eyewitnesses who identified him as the shooter, there was no physical evidence at the crime scene tying him to the incident, and '[t]he only evidence that links [appellant] to these crimes is the testimony of his alleged co-defendants, who each got significant deals from the state by testifying.' Thus, although appellant frames his assignment of error in terms of sufficiency of the evidence, appellant's contentions actually address the manifest weight of the evidence. Therefore, appellant's arguments regarding the credibility of the witnesses are more appropriately considered in our analysis of his second assignment of error. Nevertheless, we examine whether appellant's convictions for kidnapping, aggravated robbery, aggravated murder, murder, and having weapons while under disability were supported by sufficient evidence.

Appellant argues dismissal was a proper sanction under Crim.R.16 for the state’s alleged failure to disclose material evidence favorable to her defense in violation of her constitutional rights identified in Brady v. Maryland. We disagree. In Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.E.2d 215 (1963), the U.S. Supreme Court stated “the suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material to either guilt or punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.” Evidence subject to disclosure under Brady is that which is both favorable and material to the defense. For purposes of the disclosure requirement, evidence is only considered material “if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A ‘reasonable probability’ is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome. This standard of materiality applies regardless of whether the evidence is specifically, generally or not at all requested by the defense.” State v. Johnston, 39 Ohio St.3d 48, 529 N.E.2d 898 (1988), citing United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 87 L.E.2d 481 (1985). “The mere possibility that an item of undisclosed information might have helped the defense, or might have affected the outcome of the trial, does not establish ‘materiality’ in the constitutional sense.” State v. Jackson, 57 Ohio St.3d 29, 33, 565 N.E.2d 549 (1991), citing United States v. Agurs, 427 U.S. 97, 109-110, 96 S.Ct. 2392, 49 L.E.2d 342 (1976). Under these guidelines, we shall first address whether the accusations against the warden were material to appellant’s defense and therefore subject to disclosure by the state. Appellant argues the state improperly withheld material evidence that the warden charging her with cruelty to animals was, himself, previously accused of cruelty to animals. Appellant argues these allegations are material to her defense as they impact the warden’s credibility as a witness. She further argues the state’s failure to disclose this information deprived her of a fair trial. The record with regard to these allegations consists of appellant’s pretrial oral motion to dismiss and the state’s response. In support of her motion, appellant argued she received information regarding the allegations against the warden through a public records request to the Ohio Department of Agriculture which were not disclosed by the state prior to her trial. The state acknowledged having been recently made aware of an investigation into the party making the prior allegations against the warden but noted the actual claims of animal abuse were referred to the Ohio Attorney General to avoid a conflict in investigating a fellow county official. The state further noted that the Ohio Attorney General’s investigation resulted in no charges being filed against the warden and that the allegations were more than three years old at the time of appellant’s trial. Appellant countered that even an allegation of animal cruelty was sufficient to warrant disclosure as the information went to the warden’s credibility as one of the state’s two witnesses. The trial court denied appellant’s motion to dismiss based on the representations of the parties and the matter proceeded to trial. Our review of the record reveals nothing to support appellant’s argument that the allegations against the warden were material and therefore subject to disclosure. Allegations of animal cruelty against the warden from three years prior to appellant’s trial do not attach to his credibility as a witness. “Under Evid.R. 608(B), the ability of trial counsel to discredit a witness through cross-examination concerning particular conduct of a witness is not absolute; it is limited in its exercise to the court’s sound discretion in determining if the inquiry will lead to particular instances of conduct which are clearly probative of untruthfulness.” State v. Whites Landing Fisheries, LLC, 2017-Ohio-7537, 96 N.E.3d 1236, ¶ 48 (6th Dist.), citing State v. Williams, 1 Ohio App.3d 156, 158, 440 N.E.2d 65 (10th Dist.1981). In White Landing Fisheries, we affirmed the trial court’s order barring attempted impeachment of the state’s witness using allegations of past criminal behavior since those allegations, for which no criminal charges were filed, were not clearly probative of the witnesses’ untruthfulness. Id. at ¶ 52-53. We reach the same conclusion here and find no connection between the warden having been merely accused of animal cruelty and his ability to testify truthfully. Additionally, at trial the warden testified that the basis for the charges against appellant was the information he received from the veterinarian. Therefore, any issue regarding his credibility is unlikely to have resulted in a different outcome as the factual basis for the verdict was established by the veterinarian. Accordingly, we find the allegations against the warden were not subject to disclosure by the state as they do not constitute favorable material evidence as described in Brady. There is no reasonable probability that had a jury heard the warden was previously accused of animal cruelty it would have reached a different result. This lack of probability renders the allegations against the dog warden immaterial to appellant’s defense and her assignment of error fails. Appellant’s assignment of error fails for an additional reason. Indeed, her own motion to dismiss reveals her inability to succeed in supporting a Brady violation. In her motion to dismiss, she acknowledged her receipt of the allegations prior to trial. Notably, appellant does not argue that additional information was suppressed by the prosecution, but merely that the information in her possession at trial was not disclosed in response to her discovery request. As a result, the information which she complains was not disclosed was in fact available for her use when cross-examining the warden. We note that in addressing an alleged Brady violation, “[w]here *** the evidence is revealed in time for the defense to use it effectively at or before trial, no constitutional violation has occurred.” State v. Barzacchini, 96 Ohio App.3d 440, 454, 645 N.E.2d 137 (6th Dist.1994), citing United States v. Presser, 844 F.2d 1275 (6th Cir.1988). Here, appellant was aware of the allegations against the warden on the day of trial. She intended to use the animal cruelty allegations to impeach his credibility as a witness. In denying her motion to dismiss, the trial court neither ruled on the admissibility of the allegations nor limited appellant’s ability to use the allegations on cross-examination. Therefore, she had all allegedly suppressed information in her possession at the time of trial and could have attempted to use it during cross-examination of the warden. Nevertheless, appellant failed to question the warden regarding the prior allegations at trial. Having this information available for effective use at trial precludes the finding of a *Brady* violation.\"\n}\n```"}

He contends that the other acts evidence deprived him of his constitutional rights to due process and a fair trial. The state filed a notice of intent to use other acts evidence in which it asserted that it intended to introduce evidence at trial related to appellant’s relationship with Judith Spang and his 1989 conviction in Lucas County for arson. The state represented that it intended to use other acts evidence to show appellant’s motive and a clear modus operandi in which he burns down the residence of women with whom he is romantically involved. In response to the state’s notice of intent, defense counsel filed a motion in limine to exclude any evidence relating to appellant’s other crimes, wrongs, or bad acts. Therein, defense counsel argued that the evidence would be irrelevant to the charges at issue in this case, and that the evidence would be unfairly prejudicial and deny appellant his rights to due process and a fair trial. The trial court held a hearing on defense counsel’s motion in limine on December 12, 2016. The state argued that an exception to Evid.R. 404(B) applied, in that the other acts evidence was admissible to establish identity through a modus operandi. The state asserted that appellant and Judith were dating and that their relationship quickly deteriorated. The state further alleged that Judith discovered that appellant was using her credit card without her permission which caused her to break up with him. Defense counsel argued that the other acts evidence was not necessary to prove identity and that the state could establish identity by other means, such as scientific evidence, evidence related to credit card transactions, and cell phone records. Defense counsel contended that the other acts evidence was far more prejudicial than probative and that the prejudice could not be cured by a limiting instruction. Finally, defense counsel opined that the state was attempting to circumvent appellant’s Fifth Amendment right to refuse to testify at trial. After considering the parties’ arguments, the trial court ruled that it would allow the state to introduce other acts evidence over defense counsel’s objection. The record reflects that the state introduced other acts evidence at trial through the testimony of Judith’s son, Jason Spang, and Rosemary Grubbs. The state also presented other acts testimony through Grubbs regarding her romantic relationship with appellant and appellant’s conduct after they broke up. Specifically, Grubbs testified that after she ended the relationship, appellant sent her nasty emails, verbally abused her, and sent a letter to Grubbs’s employer. Grubbs also testified about an incident during which appellant acted belligerently towards an employee at Best Buy, which made her uneasy. In its notice of intent to use other acts evidence, the state did not indicate that it intended to use other acts evidence involving Grubbs. Appellant argues that the trial court erred by admitting Grubbs’s testimony because the testimony had no relevance to the case. Specifically, appellant contends that Grubbs did not know the victim, and that the state used her testimony to depict appellant as an aggressive, belligerent person. Appellant’s brief at 28. Appellant argues that Grubbs’s testimony about the email appellant sent her and his conduct at Best Buy was irrelevant and inadmissible under Evid.R. 404(B) pursuant to the three-part test in Williams, 134 Ohio St.3d 521, 2012-Ohio-5695, 983 N.E.2d 1278. The state, on the other hand, argues that the other acts evidence involving Grubbs was relevant to establishing appellant’s motive and intent — appellant targeted older women and when the relationships ended, he sought revenge. After reviewing the record, and applying the three-part Williams test to the facts of this case, we find no basis upon which to conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting the other acts evidence involving the emails that appellant sent to Grubbs. Grubbs’s testimony regarding the emails that appellant sent her is not only relevant to establishing the identity of the perpetrator of the murder and arson offenses, it was imperative to the state’s case. Grubbs’s testimony about the emails appellant sent her confirmed that the accounts used to access the banking websites on the victim’s computer after her death belonged to appellant. As noted above, the forensic examination of the victim’s computer revealed that the banking websites were accessed by a “foxsheline” account. (Tr. 1531.) Furthermore, Eric Devlin, who conducted the forensic examination, testified that he was able to rebuild approximately 1,500 web-based emails for “foxsheline” email accounts through the email providers yahoo and hotmail. Devlin explained, “I found personal [emails] that were composed to a Rosemary Grubbs by — it was under the foxsheline [email] account and it was signed by [appellant], as well.” (Tr. 1524.) Grubbs testified that appellant referred to himself in emails as “Fox.” (Tr. 1290.) Accordingly, the trial court did not err in admitting this other acts evidence. On the other hand, the other acts evidence involving Grubbs that pertained to her relationship with appellant and his conduct following their break-up is arguably irrelevant to appellant’s involvement in the murder and arson involving Bewley. Furthermore, although other acts evidence may be admitted for the legitimate purpose of showing motive, we cannot say that Grubbs’s testimony regarding appellant’s conduct after their relationship ended was relevant to appellant’s motive for killing the victim and setting her body on fire. The state asserts that appellant’s motive was “to target older women for financial support and then burn down their residence in revenge when the relationship begins to dissolve.” Appellee’s brief at 18-19. The other acts evidence involving Grubbs pertained to appellant’s conduct after she ended their romantic relationship — there was no evidence that Grubbs was supporting appellant financially, nor that he resorted to arson as a means of revenge for the break-up. Nevertheless, we cannot say that the error in the admission of Grubbs’s testimony, if any, was such that it affected appellant’s substantial rights and that there exists a reasonable probability that but for the admission of her testimony, the outcome at trial would have been different. See Parma v. Odolecki, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 104160, 2017-Ohio-2979, ¶ 64-65.

Furthermore, Eric Devlin, who conducted the forensic examination, testified that he was able to rebuild approximately 1,500 web-based emails for “foxsheline” email accounts through the email providers yahoo and hotmail. Devlin explained, “I found personal [emails] that were composed to a Rosemary Grubbs by — it was under the foxsheline [email] account and it was signed by [appellant], as well.” (Tr. 1524.) Grubbs testified that appellant referred to himself in emails as “Fox.” (Tr. 1290.) Accordingly, the trial court did not err in admitting this other acts evidence. On the other hand, the other acts evidence involving Grubbs that pertained to her relationship with appellant and his conduct following their break-up is arguably irrelevant to appellant’s involvement in the murder and arson involving Bewley. Furthermore, although other acts evidence may be admitted for the legitimate purpose of showing motive, we cannot say that Grubbs’s testimony regarding appellant’s conduct after their relationship ended was relevant to appellant’s motive for killing the victim and setting her body on fire. The state asserts that appellant’s motive was “to target older women for financial support and then burn down their residence in revenge when the relationship begins to dissolve.” Appellee’s brief at 18-19. The other acts evidence involving Grubbs pertained to appellant’s conduct after she ended their romantic relationship — there was no evidence that Grubbs was supporting appellant financially, nor that he resorted to arson as a means of revenge for the break-up. Nevertheless, we cannot say that the error in the admission of Grubbs’s testimony, if any, was such that it affected appellant’s substantial rights and that there exists a reasonable probability that but for the admission of her testimony, the outcome at trial would have been different.

He contends that the other acts evidence deprived him of his constitutional rights to due process and a fair trial. The state filed a notice of intent to use other acts evidence in which it asserted that it intended to introduce evidence at trial related to appellant’s relationship with Judith Spang and his 1989 conviction in Lucas County for arson. The state represented that it intended to use other acts evidence to show appellant’s motive and a clear modus operandi in which he burns down the residence of women with whom he is romantically involved. In response to the state’s notice of intent, defense counsel filed a motion in limine to exclude any evidence relating to appellant’s other crimes, wrongs, or bad acts. Therein, defense counsel argued that the evidence would be irrelevant to the charges at issue in this case, and that the evidence would be unfairly prejudicial and deny appellant his rights to due process and a fair trial. The trial court held a hearing on defense counsel’s motion in limine on December 12, 2016. The state argued that an exception to Evid.R. 404(B) applied, in that the other acts evidence was admissible to establish identity through a modus operandi. The state asserted that appellant and Judith were dating and that their relationship quickly deteriorated. The state further alleged that Judith discovered that appellant was using her credit card without her permission which caused her to break up with him. Defense counsel argued that the other acts evidence was not necessary to prove identity and that the state could establish identity by other means, such as scientific evidence, evidence related to credit card transactions, and cell phone records. Defense counsel contended that the other acts evidence was far more prejudicial than probative and that the prejudice could not be cured by a limiting instruction. Finally, defense counsel opined that the state was attempting to circumvent appellant’s Fifth Amendment right to refuse to testify at trial. After considering the parties’ arguments, the trial court ruled that it would allow the state to introduce other acts evidence over defense counsel’s objection. The record reflects that the state introduced other acts evidence at trial through the testimony of Judith’s son, Jason Spang, and Rosemary Grubbs. The state also presented other acts testimony through Grubbs regarding her romantic relationship with appellant and appellant’s conduct after they broke up. Specifically, Grubbs testified that after she ended the relationship, appellant sent her nasty emails, verbally abused her, and sent a letter to Grubbs’s employer. Grubbs also testified about an incident during which appellant acted belligerently towards an employee at Best Buy, which made her uneasy. In its notice of intent to use other acts evidence, the state did not indicate that it intended to use other acts evidence involving Grubbs. Appellant argues that the trial court erred by admitting Grubbs’s testimony because the testimony had no relevance to the case. Specifically, appellant contends that Grubbs did not know the victim, and that the state used her testimony to depict appellant as an aggressive, belligerent person. Appellant’s brief at 28. Appellant argues that Grubbs’s testimony about the email appellant sent her and his conduct at Best Buy was irrelevant and inadmissible under Evid.R. 404(B) pursuant to the three-part test in Williams, 134 Ohio St.3d 521, 2012-Ohio-5695, 983 N.E.2d 1278. The state, on the other hand, argues that the other acts evidence involving Grubbs was relevant to establishing appellant’s motive and intent — appellant targeted older women and when the relationships ended, he sought revenge. After reviewing the record, and applying the three-part Williams test to the facts of this case, we find no basis upon which to conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting the other acts evidence involving the emails that appellant sent to Grubbs.

He contends that when law enforcement requested the search warrant it withheld facts in order to obtain the warrant. For instance, he claims the issuing judge was not informed that Padgett had not had a romantic relationship with Appellant for over a year when the controlled purchase was arranged. Likewise, he contends the court was not informed Padgett allegedly had no contact with Appellant for over a year prior to the controlled buys. He asserts the court was not told of the statements law enforcement personnel told Padgett to use to get Appellant to sell her the drugs; the statements were to use his love for her and that she could convince him to take this risk that was so significant. Appellant argues the withholding of all this information indicates the search warrant was not based on probable cause.\\n\\nThe Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution provides that, ‘no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.’ The Fourth Amendment, however, does not contain any ‘provision expressly precluding the use of evidence obtained in violation of its commands.’ United States v. Leon, 468 U.S. 897, 906, 104 S.Ct. 3405 (1984). Rather, the exclusionary rule was judicially created to safeguard Fourth Amendment rights. State v. Hoffman, 141 Ohio St.3d 428, 2014–Ohio–4795, 25 N.E.3d 993, ¶ 24, quoting United States v. Calandra, 414 U.S. 338, 348, 94 S.Ct. 613 (1974). Consequently, evidence seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment may be suppressed pursuant to the exclusionary rule.\\n\\nPursuant to Ohio Crim.R. 41, a request for a search warrant must be accompanied by a sworn affidavit ‘establishing the grounds for issuing the warrant.’ Crim.R. 41(C)(1). A search warrant will be issued if the judge finds, based on the information in the affidavit, ‘probable cause for the search exists.’ Crim.R. 41(C)(2).\\n\\nIn determining the sufficiency of probable cause in an affidavit submitted in support of a search warrant, the duty of the judge or magistrate issuing the warrant is to simply ‘make a practical, common-sense decision whether, given all the circumstances set forth in the affidavit before him [or her], including the ‘veracity’ and ‘basis of knowledge’ of persons supplying hearsay information, there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.’ State v. George, 45 Ohio St.3d 325, 554 N.E.2d 640 (1989), paragraph one of the syllabus, quoting Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 238–239, 103 S.Ct. 2317 (1983). The issuing judge or magistrate is confined to the averments contained in the affidavit supporting the issuance of the search warrant. State v. Swift, 12th Dist. No. CA2013-08-161, 2014-Ohio-2004, ¶ 16. Therefore, it is ‘essential that an affidavit for a search warrant include facts establishing probable cause that the items sought to be searched for and seized are related to the commission of some crime.’ State v. J.A.C., 12th Dist. Nos. CA2017-04-044 and CA2017-04-045, 2018-Ohio-361, ¶ 18.\\n\\nAs the reviewing court, we do not conduct a de novo review as to whether the search warrant affidavit provided sufficient probable cause. George, 45 Ohio St.3d 325 at paragraph two of the syllabus. Rather, this court’s limited duty is to ensure the judge or magistrate issuing the search warrant had a substantial basis for concluding probable cause existed based on the information contained within the four corners of the affidavit. Id. See also Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. at 238-239. In making this determination, the reviewing courts must examine the totality of the circumstances. State v. Jones, 143 Ohio St.3d 266, 2015-Ohio-483, 37 N.E.3d 123, ¶ 13. A reviewing court is required to afford great deference to the judge or magistrate's determination of probable cause ‘and doubtful or marginal cases in this area should be resolved in favor of upholding the warrant.’ Id. at ¶ 14, quoting George, 45 Ohio St.3d 325 at paragraph two of the syllabus.\\n\\nThe affidavit used to obtain the search warrant was admitted as an exhibit at the suppression hearing. That affidavit solely relied on the two controlled drug transactions and does not reference any statements Padgett made to the officers. It also does not indicate the officer told her what statements she should say to Appellant to get him to sell her drugs. The affidavit does not indicate Padgett's previous contact with Appellant or their prior relationship.

Regarding his facial challenge to the statute, Conway argues that these conflicts amount to violations of the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution, principles of separation of powers, and the 'due course of law' and 'open courts' provisions of the Ohio Constitution. (Appellant's Brief at 7-11.) We rejected these specific challenges to the statute in our decision affirming the dismissal of Conway's successive petition for postconviction relief from his other death penalty conviction. State v. Conway, 10th Dist. No. 12AP-412, 2013-Ohio-3741, ¶ 62, applying State v. McGuire, 12th Dist. No. CA2000-10-011 (Apr. 23, 2001). We are bound by our previous holding on these issues, adopt them here, and reject Conway's facial challenge to R.C. 2953.23(A). In his 'as-applied' challenge to R.C. 2953.23(A), Conway argues as follows: As applied to Petitioner's case, the statute ignores the complex and evolving body of equitable principles established by judicial decisions. For example, the evidentiary documents presented in support of Conway's petition might not establish by clear and convincing evidence that, but for constitutional error at trial, no reasonable fact-finder would have found Conway guilty of the capital murder or sentenced him to death.

Under his assignment of error, Smith claims the trial court erred in overruling his motions for a new trial. Specifically, Smith contends his motions should have been granted because the State failed to disclose the recorded conversation between Detective Mason and Plummer. According to Smith, the State’s failure to disclose the audio recording constituted a violation of the United States Supreme Court’s decision in Brady, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215, because the recording contained information that was both material and exculpatory. We disagree. Standard of Review Generally, ‘[a] reviewing court will not disturb a trial court’s decision granting or denying a Crim.R. 33 motion for new trial absent an abuse of discretion.’ (Citation omitted.) State v. LaMar, 95 Ohio St.3d 181, 2002-Ohio-2128, 767 N.E.2d 166, ¶ 82. However, the Supreme Court of Ohio has indicated that a trial court’s ruling on a motion for new trial claiming a Brady violation should be reviewed using ‘a due process analysis rather than an abuse of discretion test because the issue on review concern[s] [the defendant’s] due process right to a fair trial, namely the suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to [the defendant].’ State v. Johnston, 39 Ohio St.3d 48, 60, 529 N.E.2d 898 (1988). Accord State v. Oldaker, 4th Dist. Meigs No. 16CA3, 2017-Ohio-1201, ¶ 19; State v. Webb, 12th Dist. Clermont No. CA2014-01-013, 2014-Ohio-2894, ¶ 16; State v. Keith, 192 Ohio App.3d 231, 2011-Ohio-407, 948 N.E.2d 976, ¶ 41 (3d Dist.); State v. Hoffman, 11th Dist. Lake No. 2001-L-022, 2002-Ohio-6576, ¶ 19. Based on this precedent, we review de novo a trial court’s ruling on a motion for new trial alleging a Brady violation, as the relevant inquiry is whether due process was violated by the prosecutor’s failure to disclose evidence. State v. Moore, 3d Dist. Union No. 14-08-43, 2009-Ohio-2106, ¶ 19; State v. Glover, 2016-Ohio-2833, 64 N.E.3d 442, ¶ 35 (8th Dist.); United States v. Bullock, 130 Fed.Appx. 706, 722 (6th Cir.2005), citing United States v. Phillip, 948 F.2d 241, 250 (6th Cir.1991) (‘[t]he standard of review for the materiality of a purported Brady violation is de novo because it presents a mixed question of law and fact’). Brady Analysis Pursuant to the United States Supreme Court’s decision in Brady, ‘the suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.’ Brady, 373 U.S. at 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215. Therefore, in order to establish a due process violation under Brady, the defendant must demonstrate that: ‘(1) the prosecution failed to disclose evidence upon request; (2) the evidence was favorable to the defendant; and (3) the evidence was material.’ State v. Goney, 2d Dist. Greene No. 2017-CA-43, 2018-Ohio-2115, ¶ 66; Moore v. Illinois, 408 U.S. 786, 794-795, 92 S.Ct. 2562, 33 L.Ed.2d 706 (1972). Because exculpatory and impeachment evidence are favorable to the defendant, both types of evidence may be the subject of a *Brady* violation, so long as the evidence is material. *United States v. Bagley*, 473 U.S. 667, 676, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 87 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985). ‘Evidence is considered material ‘if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different.’ ’ State v. Royster, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 26378, 2015-Ohio-625, ¶ 16, quoting *Bagley* at 682. A ‘reasonable probability’ is ‘a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.’ *Bagley* at 682. ‘As a rule, undisclosed evidence is not material simply because it may have helped the defendant to prepare for trial.’ State v. Brown, 115 Ohio St.3d 55, 2007-Ohio-4837, 873 N.E.2d 858, ¶ 49. ‘The United States Supreme Court has rejected a standard of materiality that focuses ‘on the impact of the undisclosed evidence on the defendant’s ability to prepare for trial, rather than the materiality of the evidence to the issue of guilt or innocence.’ ’ *Id.*, quoting *United States v. Agurs*, 427 U.S. 97, 112-113, 96 S.Ct. 2392, 49 L.Ed.2d 342 (1976), fn. 20. Furthermore, no *Brady* violation occurs when the undisclosed evidence is cumulative to evidence already known by the defense at the time of trial. *See State v. Cook*, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-950090, 1995 WL 763671, *3 (Dec. 29, 1995). There is also no *Brady* violation ‘if the evidence that was allegedly withheld is merely cumulative to evidence presented at trial.’ (Citations omitted.) *State v. Bonilla*, 2d Dist. Greene No. 2008 CA 68, 2009-Ohio-4784, ¶ 26. In this case, there is no dispute that the recording of the conversation between Detective Mason and Plummer was not disclosed by the State until after Smith’s trial concluded. However, after reviewing the recording in question, this court finds that a majority of the information on the recording was cumulative to information already known by Smith prior to trial. This is because a majority of the information on the recording was also contained in the summary report prepared by Detective Mason and in Plummer's written statement, both of which were disclosed to Smith during discovery. Nevertheless, there was some information on the recording that was not contained in either Detective Mason's report or Plummer's written statement. Upon review, this court finds that such information was not favorable to Smith and/or not material. The information in question was as follows: - Plummer's former boyfriend, Ferguson, told her that Smith's ‘thing’ was choking people and that Smith had even choked Ferguson before. - Plummer believed that Smith was doing drugs not only because Plummer had money missing (which was indicated in Mason's report and Plummer's written statement), but also because Smith was acting funny, being secretive, and going into other rooms of her apartment and staying there for long periods of time. Plummer also indicated that a friend saw Smith ‘get something.’ - Plummer's eyes were yellow with blood in them after Smith choked her. - Plummer was on a respirator in the hospital due to breathing problems. - Smith wanted to kiss Plummer and tried to have sex with Plummer, but they were never naked around each other and Plummer never wanted that kind of relationship with Smith. - Plummer had drug problems in the past. - Ferguson had been Smith's friend for 35 years. - Plummer had a protection order against Ferguson. - Despite having a protection order against Ferguson, Plummer contacted Ferguson and told him about Smith choking her, which upset Ferguson. - Ferguson told Plummer that he had gotten on Smith's Facebook page ‘and wrote a bunch of stuff,’ which scared Plummer because it alerted Smith to the fact that she had called the police. - Ferguson had not been ‘hanging around’ Smith. Plummer’s statements concerning Smith’s suspected drug use and Ferguson’s report of Smith’s tendency to choke others were clearly unfavorable to Smith in that they lend credibility to Plummer’s version of events and did nothing more than weaken Smith’s credibility. Plummer’s statement regarding her yellow, bloodshot eyes was also unfavorable to Smith because it was consistent with the photographs of Plummer’s injuries which were disclosed to Smith during discovery. Likewise, Plummer’s statement that she was on a respirator due to breathing problems was unfavorable to Smith because it contradicted Smith’s claim that Plummer wanted to be choked (and ultimately deprived of air) for sexual gratification. Instead, Plummer’s claimed breathing problem and need for a respirator supported her assertion that the choking incident was not consensual. Plummer’s statements indicating that she never kissed Smith, was never nude around Smith, and never wanted a sexual relationship with Smith were consistent with her trial testimony and were clearly unfavorable to Smith's consensual sexual encounter defense. Specifically, these statements supported Plummer's claim that she never had sex with Smith, a claim that was present in Detective Mason's summary report. Despite this, Smith argues that Plummer could be heard hesitating on the recording when Detective Mason asked her whether she had a sexual relationship with Smith. Smith argues that said hesitation was favorable evidence that could have been used to attack Plummer's credibility. After reviewing the portion of the recording in question, this court finds that Plummer merely said the word 'um' and briefly paused before answering Detective Mason's question. Contrary to Smith's claim otherwise, nothing in the nature or timing of Plummer's response would make one question its veracity. The remainder of the non-cumulative information on the recording concerned Plummer's prior drug problem and her former boyfriend, Ferguson. The fact that Plummer had a prior drug problem would have been inadmissible at trial because it was extrinsic to the felonious assault and was not clearly probative of Plummer's truthfulness or untruthfulness. See Evid.R. 608(B). Because Plummer's prior drug problem was inadmissible, it would not have affected the outcome of trial, and thus did not constitute material evidence. Finally, the information regarding Plummer's former boyfriend, Ferguson, was also immaterial evidence, as it had nothing to do with the felonious assault in question and would not have impacted the jury's guilty verdict. We further note that Plummer's written statement referred to Ferguson by name, and thus put the defense on notice of Ferguson’s relationship to the parties. The defense, therefore, was free to locate and question Ferguson prior to trial. Smith nevertheless argues that the information on the audio recording was favorable and material because it could have been used to impeach Detective Mason’s and Plummer’s trial testimony. This claim fails for multiple reasons. With regard to Plummer, the only information on the audio recording that was inconsistent with Plummer’s trial testimony was a statement that Plummer made to Mason indicating that she told Smith several times to stop choking her. During trial, Plummer testified that she was unable to tell Smith to stop choking her because she was gasping for air. Plummer’s inconsistent statement in the audio recording, however, was included in Detective Mason’s supplemental report. Therefore, Smith was aware of the inconsistency prior to trial and could have impeached Plummer using the detective’s report. As for Detective Mason, the only inconsistency in Mason’s trial testimony and the audio recording was unfavorable to Smith. Specifically, Mason testified and wrote in his report that Plummer told him she and Smith kissed each other one time in the past. That statement, however, was not supported by the audio recording, as Plummer merely told Mason that Smith ‘wanted to kiss [her] and stuff.’ During the recorded conversation, Plummer never stated that she and Smith had kissed. This information did not favor Smith in any way, but instead supported Plummer’s claim that she and Smith were just friends. For the foregoing reasons, we do not find that the State’s inadvertent failure to disclose the recorded conversation between Detective Mason and Plummer constituted a Brady violation, as the information on the audio recording was cumulative to information already known by the defense prior to trial and/or did not constitute favorable, material evidence that would have affected the outcome of trial.\"\n}\n```"}

The state nevertheless contends that Buehner could have made the public records request within the 120-day period prescribed by Crim.R. 33(B), and that Buehner has offered no explanation as to why he waited almost 12 years after his conviction to request this information. We think the explanation is obvious; the state informed Buehner’s trial counsel that no exculpatory statements from Anderson or any of the identified witnesses existed at the time of trial. Buehner would have had no reason to believe that a request for exculpatory evidence made within 120 days after the verdict would produce a different result from the very same request made prior to trial, particularly since the state was required to produce the requested evidence before trial under Crim.R. 16. Exculpatory evidence is evidence that would tend to exculpate a defendant of guilt or reduce a defendant’s penalty. Anderson told police that the shooter and the other two individuals in the truck were black whereas Buehner is white. If believed, Anderson’s statement suggests that someone other than Buehner murdered Saunders. Additionally, Gail Jenkins told police that although the driver of the truck was white, the other two passengers were black, including the middle passenger. Had Gail Jenkins testified at trial, her testimony would have contradicted Price’s and Edwards’s testimony to the extent that they claimed there were two white perpetrators and one black perpetrator in the black truck. Therefore, at the very least, Anderson and Jenkins’s statements constituted exculpatory evidence that should have been produced in pretrial discovery. The state asserts there was no evidence that the prosecutor had Anderson’s, Jenkins’s, or any other undisclosed statements in its possession prior to trial. Indeed, the prosecutor stated on the record on the first day of trial that he was cognizant of defense counsel’s requests for exculpatory evidence and of the state’s continuing duty to provide exculpatory information to the defense, but that ‘there was nothing to give them.’ The record indicates that the state provided full discovery responses to Buehner’s requests based on the evidence in the state’s possession, and that the undisclosed witness statements remained in the possession of the Cleveland Police Department. Therefore, there is no evidence that the state intentionally withheld exculpatory evidence from the defense. However, the Cleveland Police Department’s knowledge is imputed to the state. Therefore, even if Anderson and the other witnesses’ statements were never turned over to the prosecutor’s office, the state was not relieved of its obligation to disclose them. Buehner had no knowledge of the exculpatory information contained in the undisclosed police reports. Nor did he have any reason to believe that the police reports contained improperly suppressed exculpatory evidence because the state represented that no exculpatory evidence existed. Therefore, although Buehner’s motion for new trial was untimely, his motion for leave to file a motion for new trial and the supporting documents clearly and convincingly demonstrate that Buehner was avoidably prevented from discovering the exculpatory evidence. Therefore, the trial court erred in denying Buehner’s motion for leave to file a motion for new trial.\"\n}\n```"}

Maryland*, 373 U.S. 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194, [10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963)] and [the trial court] did not hold a hearing on the issues.", "discussion": "```json\n{\n  \"discussion\": \"In the sole assignment of error, Austin argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea because the state withheld critical evidence from him — specifically, surveillance video footage. Austin further argues that the state’s failure to provide him with the surveillance video amounted to a *Brady* violation that caused him to “wrongfully accept a plea agreement,” resulting in a manifest injustice. As explained above, the state concedes that the trial court erred in denying Austin’s motion, but for a different reason. The state, relying on State v. Moon, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 101930, 2015-Ohio-1648, argues the trial court was without jurisdiction to rule on Austin’s motion while his direct appeal was pending before this court. In Moon, this court found that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to rule on the defendant’s motion to withdraw his guilty plea because the trial court ruled on his motion during the pendency of his direct appeal, which involved his guilty plea. Moon at ¶ 7. As a result, the trial court’s ruling on the motion was a nullity. Id., citing State v. Lauharn, 2d Dist. Miami No. 2011 CA 10, 2012-Ohio-1572, ¶ 9-10. This court has explained “[w]hen a notice of appeal is filed, the trial court loses jurisdiction except to take action in aid of the appeal.” State v. Drake, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 105908, 2017-Ohio-7328, ¶ 2, citing State ex rel. Special Prosecutors v. Judges, Court of Common Pleas, 55 Ohio St.2d 94, 97, 378 N.E.2d 162 (1978). The trial court retains jurisdiction over issues “‘not inconsistent with the appellate court’s jurisdiction to reverse, modify, or affirm the judgment from which an appeal is taken’ — what is characterized as acts ‘not in conflict’ with appellate jurisdiction.” Id., quoting Yee v. Erie Cty. Sheriff’s Dept., 51 Ohio St.3d 43, 44, 553 N.E.2d 1354 (1990). In Drake, we explained that an exception to the rule in Special Prosecutors exists for collateral attacks to a judgment of conviction. Id. at _ 3. Specifically, “R.C. 2953.21(D) states: ‘the court shall consider a petition that is timely filed under division (A)(2) of this section even if a direct appeal of the judgment is pending.’” Id., quoting R.C. 2953.21(D). “However, ‘R.C. 2953.21 and 2953.23 do not govern a Crim.R. 32.1 postsentence motion to withdraw a guilty plea.’” Id., quoting State v. Bush, 96 Ohio St.3d 235, 2002-Ohio-3993, 773 N.E.2d 522, syllabus. “Given that a postsentence Crim.R. 32.1 motion is not collateral[,] but is filed in the underlying criminal case and * * * targets the withdrawal of a plea, it is not a ‘collateral challenge to the validity of a conviction or sentence.’” Bush at ¶ 13, quoting State v. Calhoun, 86 Ohio St.3d 279, 281, 1999-Ohio-102, 714 N.E.2d 905. In the instant case, Austin plainly styled his motion as a motion to withdraw a guilty plea under Crim.R. 32.1. The trial court ruled on this motion while Austin’s direct appeal concerning his guilty plea was pending before this court. As a result, the trial court was without jurisdiction to rule on this motion. Drake at _ 4; Moon at _ 7. Therefore, the trial court’s denial of the motion was a nullity. Id., citing Lauharn at _ 13.

In his first assignment, Goney contends that the trial court erred when it imposed a definite prison term for the RVOs. Specifically, Goney argues that pursuant to R.C. 2929.14(B)(2)(b), the jury, not the trial court, was required to find that Goney attempted to cause, threatened to cause, or actually caused serious physical harm before the trial court could impose sentence for the RVO specifications. R.C. 2929.14(B)(2)(b) states in pertinent part: (b) The court shall impose on an offender the longest prison term authorized or required for the offense and shall impose on the offender an additional definite prison term of one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, or ten years if all of the following criteria are met: (i) The offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a specification of the type described in section 2941.149 of the Revised Code that the offender is a repeat violent offender. (ii) The offender within the preceding twenty years has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to three or more offenses described in division (CC)(1) of section 2929.01 of the Revised Code * * * (iii) The offense or offenses of which the offender currently is convicted * * * (is) any felony of the second degree that is an offense of violence and the trier of fact finds that the offense involved an attempt to cause or a threat to cause serious physical harm to a person or resulted in serious physical harm to a person. Based upon the language in R.C. 2929.14(B)(2)(b)(iii), Goney argues that the jury, not the trial court, was required to find beyond a reasonable doubt that he attempted to cause or threatened to cause serious physical harm, or that his actions resulted in serious physical harm. Each crime for which Goney was convicted required him to be found guilty of inflicting, attempting to inflict, or threatening to inflict only physical harm, not serious physical harm. Goney was ultimately convicted of Count I, robbery (R.C. 2911.02(A)(2)), Count III, kidnapping (R.C. 2905.01(A)(2)), and Count IV, abduction (R.C. 2905.01(A)(2)). As previously stated, the trial court merged Count IV into Count III. The trial court sentenced Goney to a mandatory eight years in prison for robbery. Upon finding Goney to be a repeat violent offender, the trial court imposed an additional two years in prison to be served consecutively to his eight-year robbery sentence. With respect to his sentence for kidnapping, the trial court sentenced Goney to a mandatory eight years in prison. Again, finding Goney to be a repeat violent offender, the trial court imposed an additional two years in prison to be served consecutively to his eight-year kidnapping sentence. The trial court then ordered that Goney’s sentences for Counts I and III be served consecutively to one another, for an aggregate sentence of twenty years in prison. R.C. 2911.02(A)(2) states in pertinent part: (A) No person, in attempting or committing a theft offense or in fleeing immediately after the attempt or offense, shall do any of the following: (2) Inflict, attempt to inflict, or threaten to inflict physical harm on another[.] R.C. 2905.01(A)(2) states in pertinent part: (A) No person, by force, threat, or deception, * * *, shall remove another from the place where the other person is found or restrain the liberty of the other person, for any of the following purposes: (2) To facilitate the commission of any felony or flight thereafter[.] Initially, we note that we agree with the Eleventh District Court of Appeals in State v. Payne, 11th Dist. Lake No. 2004-L-118, 2005-Ohio-7043, in which the court held that in order to be constitutionally permissible under Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), “any fact, other than a prior conviction, must be determined by a jury or admitted by the appellant.” (Emphasis sic.) Id. at ¶ 114. Thus, any fact other than a prior conviction that is found by a jury or admitted by the defendant complies with Apprendi, regardless of whether it relates to a prior or current conviction. State v. Wilson, __ N.E.3d __, 2018-Ohio-902, ¶ 90 (11th Dist.). It is undisputed that in the instant case, Goney did not admit to any allegations that he attempted to cause or threatened serious physical harm, or that his actions resulted in serious physical harm with respect to any of the offenses for which he was convicted. Accordingly, under Apprendi, Goney was entitled to have a jury decide whether he should be designated as a repeat violent offender. See State v. Bishop, 5th Dist. Stark No. 2014-CA-190, 2015-Ohio-3023, ¶ 19–21. Nevertheless, as the U.S. Supreme Court stated in Blakely v. Washington, 542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), “nothing prevents a defendant from waiving his Apprendi rights [to a jury determination of every element of the charge]. *** Even a defendant who stands trial may consent to judicial fact-finding as to sentence enhancements, which may well be in his interest if relevant evidence would prejudice him at trial.” Id. at 310. While the Sixth Amendment generally prohibits judicial fact-finding, there is an “exception for prior criminal convictions and the defendant's consent to judicial fact-finding.” State v. Hunter, 123 Ohio St.3d 164, 2009-Ohio-4147, 915 N.E.2d 292, ¶ 30, citing State v. Foster, 109 Ohio St.3d 1, 2006-Ohio-856, 845 N.E.2d 470, ¶ 7. Prior to trial, Goney filed a motion in limine in which he noted that pursuant to R.C. 2941.149(B), “[t]he court shall determine the issue of whether an offender is a repeat violent offender.” Therefore, according to Goney's liminal motion, “[t]he issue of whether the Defendant is a repeat violent offender is a question for the court, not the jury.” Accordingly, Goney requested that the trial court determine whether he should be designated as a RVO. The trial court granted Goney’s motion in limine at a hearing where Goney was present. Thus, Goney consented to judicial fact-finding regarding his designation as a repeat violent offender. That is not the end of our analysis, however. In the instant case, although the trial court was asked to determine if Goney was guilty of the RVO specifications, the trial court was still required to make all of the appropriate findings based upon the evidence before enhancing Goney’s sentence as an RVO. The trial court was only permitted to enhance Goney’s sentence relative to the RVO specifications if, as trier of fact, the trial court found appellant's actions threatened, attempted, or resulted in “serious physical harm” to the victim. See State v. Brown, 10th Dist. Franklin Nos. 10AP-836 and 10AP-845, 2011-Ohio-3159, ¶ 23, fn. 2 (holding the trial court properly enhanced the defendant's sentence for second-degree felony robbery only because the indictment for the attached RVO specification alleged “serious physical harm” and the jury instructions for the robbery count included a finding of “serious physical harm”); State v. Davis, 7th Dist. Mahoning No. 08 MA 152, 2009-Ohio-5079, ¶ 36 (holding that, although the defendant may have in fact threatened to cause serious physical harm to the robbery victims, only the trier of fact was permitted to make such a finding for purposes of penalty enhancement). Initially, we note that nowhere in Goney’s indictment did the State allege that he attempted to cause or threatened “serious physical harm,” or that his actions resulted in “serious physical harm” with respect to any of the offenses for which he was convicted. Moreover, the jury instructions contain no mention of “serious physical harm.” Most importantly, the trial court did not make a finding that Goney attempted to cause or threatened “serious physical harm” against the complaining witness, Melissa Wright, before finding him guilty of the RVO specifications, and the trial record contains no threat of serious physical harm. In fact, at the sentencing hearing held on July 10, 2017, the trial court stated the following: The Court: As recorded in the Court’s repeat violent offender entry, the Court found the Defendant to be a repeat violent offender, and pursuant to R.C. 2929.14(B)(2)(b) finds the following: The Defendant is convicted of a R.C. 2941.149 specification that the Defendant is a repeat violent offender. The offense the Defendant is currently convicted of is a second degree felony that is an offense of violence, and the trier of fact finds that the offense involved an attempt or a threat to cause physical harm to a person or result in serious physical harm to a person. (Emphasis added.) Here, we find that the trial court made the proper findings with respect to R.C. 2929.14(B)(2)(b)(i) and (ii). Specifically, the trial court found that Goney was “convicted of a specification of the type described in section 2941.149 of the Revised Code that the offender is a repeat violent offender,” and he “within the preceding twenty years has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to three or more offenses described in division (CC)(1) of section 2929.01 of the Revised Code * * *.” Id. However, with respect to R.C. 2929.14(B)(2)(b)(iii), the record establishes that the trial court failed to find that Goney attempted to cause or threatened “serious physical harm” against a person before finding him guilty of the RVO specifications. Rather, as noted above, the trial court found “that the offense involved an attempt or a threat to cause physical harm to a person.” (Emphasis added.) Simply put, “physical harm” and “serious physical harm” represent two distinct legal standards and cannot be used interchangeably. Therefore, pursuant to the clear language in R.C. 2929.14(B)(2)(b)(iii), the trial court failed to make the proper findings. Furthermore, although the trial court ostensibly found “that the offense involved * * * serious physical harm to a person,” there is no evidence in the record to support such a finding, with regard to Wright based on the evidence surrounding the robbery of the Fairborn Circle K. Thus, because the trial court failed to make the proper findings pursuant to R.C. 2929.14(B)(2)(b)(iii), it erred when it found Goney guilty of the RVO specifications.\"\n}\n```"}

Rather, as noted above, the trial court found “that the offense involved an attempt or a threat to cause physical harm to a person.” (Emphasis added.) Simply put, “physical harm” and “serious physical harm” represent two distinct legal standards and cannot be used interchangeably. Therefore, pursuant to the clear language in R.C. 2929.14(B)(2)(b)(iii), the trial court failed to make the proper findings. Furthermore, although the trial court ostensibly found “that the offense involved * * * serious physical harm to a person,” there is no evidence in the record to support such a finding, with regard to Wright based on the evidence surrounding the robbery of the Fairborn Circle K. Thus, because the trial court failed to make the proper findings pursuant to R.C. 2929.14(B)(2)(b)(iii), it erred when it found Goney guilty of the RVO specifications.\"\n}\n```"}
{"Index": "425-Goney", "allegation_num": "allegation_4", "allegation": "THE TRIAL COURT ERRED WHEN IT DENIED THE DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR A MISTRIAL.", "discussion": "```json\n{\n  \"discussion\": \"Goney's first assignment of error is as follows: THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN IMPOSING A DEFINITE PRISON TERM FOR A REPEAT VIOLENT OFFENDER SPECIFICATION. In his first assignment, Goney contends that the trial court erred when it imposed a definite prison term for the RVOs. Specifically, Goney argues that pursuant to R.C. 2929.14(B)(2)(b), the jury, not the trial court, was required to find that Goney attempted to cause, threatened to cause, or actually caused serious physical harm before the trial court could impose sentence for the RVO specifications. R.C. 2929.14(B)(2)(b) states in pertinent part: (b) The court shall impose on an offender the longest prison term authorized or required for the offense and shall impose on the offender an additional definite prison term of one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, or ten years if all of the following criteria are met: (i) The offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a specification of the type described in section 2941.149 of the Revised Code that the offender is a repeat violent offender. (ii) The offender within the preceding twenty years has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to three or more offenses described in division (CC)(1) of section 2929.01 of the Revised Code * * * (iii) The offense or offenses of which the offender currently is convicted * * * (is) any felony of the second degree that is an offense of violence and the trier of fact finds that the offense involved an attempt to cause or a threat to cause serious physical harm to a person or resulted in serious physical harm to a person. Based upon the language in R.C. 2929.14(B)(2)(b)(iii), Goney argues that the jury, not the trial court, was required to find beyond a reasonable doubt that he attempted to cause or threatened to cause serious physical harm, or that his actions resulted in serious physical harm. Each crime for which Goney was convicted required him to be found guilty of inflicting, attempting to inflict, or threatening to inflict only physical harm, not serious physical harm. Goney was ultimately convicted of Count I, robbery (R.C. 2911.02(A)(2)), Count III, kidnapping (R.C. 2905.01(A)(2)), and Count IV, abduction (R.C. 2905.01(A)(2)). As previously stated, the trial court merged Count IV into Count III. The trial court sentenced Goney to a mandatory eight years in prison for robbery. Upon finding Goney to be a repeat violent offender, the trial court imposed an additional two years in prison to be served consecutively to his eight-year robbery sentence. With respect to his sentence for kidnapping, the trial court sentenced Goney to a mandatory eight years in prison. Again, finding Goney to be a repeat violent offender, the trial court imposed an additional two years in prison to be served consecutively to his eight-year kidnapping sentence. The trial court then ordered that Goney’s sentences for Counts I and III be served consecutively to one another, for an aggregate sentence of twenty years in prison. R.C. 2911.02(A)(2) states in pertinent part: (A) No person, in attempting or committing a theft offense or in fleeing immediately after the attempt or offense, shall do any of the following: (2) Inflict, attempt to inflict, or threaten to inflict physical harm on another[.] R.C. 2905.01(A)(2) states in pertinent part: (A) No person, by force, threat, or deception, * * *, shall remove another from the place where the other person is found or restrain the liberty of the other person, for any of the following purposes: (2) To facilitate the commission of any felony or flight thereafter[.] Initially, we note that we agree with the Eleventh District Court of Appeals in State v. Payne, 11th Dist. Lake No. 2004-L-118, 2005-Ohio-7043, in which the court held that in order to be constitutionally permissible under Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), “any fact, other than a prior conviction, must be determined by a jury or admitted by the appellant.” (Emphasis sic.) Id. at ¶ 114. Thus, any fact other than a prior conviction that is found by a jury or admitted by the defendant complies with Apprendi, regardless of whether it relates to a prior or current conviction. State v. Wilson, __ N.E.3d __, 2018-Ohio-902, ¶ 90 (11th Dist.). It is undisputed that in the instant case, Goney did not admit to any allegations that he attempted to cause or threatened serious physical harm, or that his actions resulted in serious physical harm with respect to any of the offenses for which he was convicted. Accordingly, under Apprendi, Goney was entitled to have a jury decide whether he should be designated as a repeat violent offender. See State v. Bishop, 5th Dist. Stark No. 2014-CA-190, 2015-Ohio-3023, ¶ 19–21. Nevertheless, as the U.S. Supreme Court stated in Blakely v. Washington, 542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), “nothing prevents a defendant from waiving his Apprendi rights [to a jury determination of every element of the charge]. *** Even a defendant who stands trial may consent to judicial fact-finding as to sentence enhancements, which may well be in his interest if relevant evidence would prejudice him at trial.” Id. at 310. While the Sixth Amendment generally prohibits judicial fact-finding, there is an “exception for prior criminal convictions and the defendant's consent to judicial fact-finding.” State v. Hunter, 123 Ohio St.3d 164, 2009-Ohio-4147, 915 N.E.2d 292, ¶ 30, citing State v. Foster, 109 Ohio St.3d 1, 2006-Ohio-856, 845 N.E.2d 470, ¶ 7. Prior to trial, Goney filed a motion in limine in which he noted that pursuant to R.C. 2941.149(B), “[t]he court shall determine the issue of whether an offender is a repeat violent offender.” Therefore, according to Goney's liminal motion, “[t]he issue of whether the Defendant is a repeat violent offender is a question for the court, not the jury.” Accordingly, Goney requested that the trial court determine whether he should be designated as a RVO. The trial court granted Goney’s motion in limine at a hearing where Goney was present. Thus, Goney consented to judicial fact-finding regarding his designation as a repeat violent offender. That is not the end of our analysis, however. In the instant case, although the trial court was asked to determine if Goney was guilty of the RVO specifications, the trial court was still required to make all of the appropriate findings based upon the evidence before enhancing Goney’s sentence as an RVO. The trial court was only permitted to enhance Goney’s sentence relative to the RVO specifications if, as trier of fact, the trial court found appellant's actions threatened, attempted, or resulted in “serious physical harm” to the victim. See State v. Brown, 10th Dist. Franklin Nos. 10AP-836 and 10AP-845, 2011-Ohio-3159, ¶ 23, fn. 2 (holding the trial court properly enhanced the defendant's sentence for second-degree felony robbery only because the indictment for the attached RVO specification alleged “serious physical harm” and the jury instructions for the robbery count included a finding of “serious physical harm”); State v. Davis, 7th Dist. Mahoning No. 08 MA 152, 2009-Ohio-5079, ¶ 36 (holding that, although the defendant may have in fact threatened to cause serious physical harm to the robbery victims, only the trier of fact was permitted to make such a finding for purposes of penalty enhancement). Initially, we note that nowhere in Goney’s indictment did the State allege that he attempted to cause or threatened “serious physical harm,” or that his actions resulted in “serious physical harm” with respect to any of the offenses for which he was convicted. Moreover, the jury instructions contain no mention of “serious physical harm.” Most importantly, the trial court did not make a finding that Goney attempted to cause or threatened “serious physical harm” against the complaining witness, Melissa Wright, before finding him guilty of the RVO specifications, and the trial record contains no threat of serious physical harm. In fact, at the sentencing hearing held on July 10, 2017, the trial court stated the following: The Court: As recorded in the Court’s repeat violent offender entry, the Court found the Defendant to be a repeat violent offender, and pursuant to R.C. 2929.14(B)(2)(b) finds the following: The Defendant is convicted of a R.C. 2941.149 specification that the Defendant is a repeat violent offender. The offense the Defendant is currently convicted of is a second degree felony that is an offense of violence, and the trier of fact finds that the offense involved an attempt or a threat to cause physical harm to a person or result in serious physical harm to a person. (Emphasis added.) Here, we find that the trial court made the proper findings with respect to R.C. 2929.14(B)(2)(b)(i) and (ii). Specifically, the trial court found that Goney was “convicted of a specification of the type described in section 2941.149 of the Revised Code that the offender is a repeat violent offender,” and he “within the preceding twenty years has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to three or more offenses described in division (CC)(1) of section 2929.01 of the Revised Code * * *.” Id. However, with respect to R.C. 2929.14(B)(2)(b)(iii), the record establishes that the trial court failed to find that Goney attempted to cause or threatened “serious physical harm” against a person before finding him guilty of the RVO specifications. Rather, as noted above, the trial court found “that the offense involved an attempt or a threat to cause physical harm to a person.” (Emphasis added.) Simply put, “physical harm” and “serious physical harm” represent two distinct legal standards and cannot be used interchangeably. Therefore, pursuant to the clear language in R.C. 2929.14(B)(2)(b)(iii), the trial court failed to make the proper findings. Furthermore, although the trial court ostensibly found “that the offense involved * * * serious physical harm to a person,” there is no evidence in the record to support such a finding, with regard to Wright based on the evidence surrounding the robbery of the Fairborn Circle K. Thus, because the trial court failed to make the proper findings pursuant to R.C. 2929.14(B)(2)(b)(iii), it erred when it found Goney guilty of the RVO specifications.\"\n}\n```"}

Evid.R. 404(B) provides that ‘[e]vidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.’ R.C. 2945.59 contains a similar provision. The evidence, even though offered for an admissible purpose, must be excluded ‘if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, of confusion of the issues, or of misleading the jury.’ Evid.R. 403(A). Prior to trial, the state filed a notice that it intended, pursuant to Evid.R. 404(B), to use evidence of Barrow’s involvement in and conviction for another kidnapping. At trial, the state sought to introduce this evidence through testimony by Sergeant Howard Grant. Just prior to Grant’s testimony, defense counsel asked for a sidebar conference. He requested that the trial court provide a limiting instruction. The trial court stated that it would give a limiting instruction that the state was offering the testimony to show modus operandi and identity, to show that Barrow’s actions were purposeful, and that Barrow’s involvement was not part of a scheme with George. Grant then testified that he became aware that police were investigating an ongoing kidnapping and were concerned for the victim’s safety. He informed Detective Hilbert, the investigating officer, that six to seven months earlier he had investigated two kidnappings that were similar to the one Detective Hilbert was investigating. At that point, the trial court, at the state's request, gave the jury the following limiting instruction: ‘Evidence is about to be received about the commission of crimes or other acts other than the offense with which the defendant, Mr. Barrow, is charged in this trial. That evidence is being received only for a limited purpose. It is not received and you may not consider it to prove the character of the defendant in order to show that he acted in conformity with that character. If you find that the evidence of other crimes or acts is true and that the defendant, Mr. Barrow, committed them you may consider that evidence only for the purposes of deciding whether it proves the defendant’s motive, intent, or purpose, preparation or plan to commit the offenses charged in this trial and also the identity of Mr. Barrow as well as the fact that he was not part of a plan or scheme involving -- with Mr. George.’ Sergeant Grant testified that in 2013 and 2014, he had investigated two kidnappings two weeks apart where an individual had been kidnapped and held for a large ransom. Barrow's counsel then asked to approach the bench. Defense counsel objected, arguing that Barrow had been investigated for two kidnapping incidents, but charged for only one of them. The court stated that the limiting instruction sufficiently covered these acts as well as any conviction, that the assistant prosecuting attorney would clarify that Barrow had been charged in connection with only one investigation, and that the defense counsel would have the opportunity to clarify that on cross-examination. Following the sidebar conference, Sergeant Grant testified that he had been investigating two kidnappings where the kidnapped individuals had relatives who were known participants in the drug trade and carried large sums of money. The kidnappers would make phone contact with the victim, lure the victim to a location, throw the victim into a van, and then drive to another location to bind the victim. The kidnappers would then contact the victim's family, threatening to kill the victim or his or her family members if they did not pay the ransom. Sergeant Grant testified that Barrow had been a suspect in both kidnapping investigations. He had been charged in connection with one of these kidnappings and he had pleaded guilty to kidnapping. Here, evidence of the first police investigation of Barrow and his prior kidnapping conviction was relevant and was admitted for proper purposes under Evid.R. 404(B). Barrow's defense at trial was that he did not lure George into his van and hold him for ransom, but that George had solicited Barrow to stage his own kidnapping to extort money from his family. Thus, Barrow placed his motive, plan, and intent at issue in the trial. Sergeant Grant's testimony was admissible to prove Barrow's motive and intent when he lured George into the van and held him for ransom. See State v. Johnson, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 23508, 2011-Ohio-1133, ¶ 55. Evidence that Barrow had engaged in an identical kidnapping scheme six to seven months earlier tended to disprove Barrow's assertion that the kidnapping was a ruse. Thus, the trial court did not err by admitting the evidence. While Barrow claims that the trial court's limiting instruction to the jury was not effective to correct any prejudice stemming from Sergeant Grant's testimony, he points to no specific instance of prejudice. The jury is presumed to follow the instructions, including curative instructions, given to it by the trial court judge. *State v. Loza*, 71 Ohio St.3d 61, 75, 641 N.E.2d 1082 (1994). The trial court, erred, however, in permitting Sergeant Grant to testify about the second kidnapping investigation where Barrow had been a suspect, but had not been charged with a crime.

The court stated that the limiting instruction sufficiently covered these acts as well as any conviction, that the assistant prosecuting attorney would clarify that Barrow had been charged in connection with only one investigation, and that the defense counsel would have the opportunity to clarify that on cross-examination. Following the sidebar conference, Sergeant Grant testified that he had been investigating two kidnappings where the kidnapped individuals had relatives who were known participants in the drug trade and carried large sums of money. The kidnappers would make phone contact with the victim, lure the victim to a location, throw the victim into a van, and then drive to another location to bind the victim. The kidnappers would then contact the victim's family, threatening to kill the victim or his or her family members if they did not pay the ransom. Sergeant Grant testified that Barrow had been a suspect in both kidnapping investigations. He had been charged in connection with one of these kidnappings and he had pleaded guilty to kidnapping. Here, evidence of the first police investigation of Barrow and his prior kidnapping conviction was relevant and was admitted for proper purposes under Evid.R. 404(B). Barrow's defense at trial was that he did not lure George into his van and hold him for ransom, but that George had solicited Barrow to stage his own kidnapping to extort money from his family. Thus, Barrow placed his motive, plan, and intent at issue in the trial. Sergeant Grant's testimony was admissible to prove Barrow's motive and intent when he lured George into the van and held him for ransom. See State v. Johnson, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 23508, 2011-Ohio-1133, ¶ 55. Evidence that Barrow had engaged in an identical kidnapping scheme six to seven months earlier tended to disprove Barrow's assertion that the kidnapping was a ruse. Thus, the trial court did not err by admitting the evidence. While Barrow claims that the trial court's limiting instruction to the jury was not effective to correct any prejudice stemming from Sergeant Grant's testimony, he points to no specific instance of prejudice. The jury is presumed to follow the instructions, including curative instructions, given to it by the trial court judge. *State v. Loza*, 71 Ohio St.3d 61, 75, 641 N.E.2d 1082 (1994). The trial court, erred, however, in permitting Sergeant Grant to testify about the second kidnapping investigation where Barrow had been a suspect, but had not been charged with a crime. But error, if any, was harmless on this record. The state’s evidence against Barrow was overwhelming. We, therefore, overrule the first assignment of error.\"\n}\n```"}

Evid.R. 404(B) provides that ‘[e]vidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.’ R.C. 2945.59 contains a similar provision. The evidence, even though offered for an admissible purpose, must be excluded ‘if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, of confusion of the issues, or of misleading the jury.’ Evid.R. 403(A). Prior to trial, the state filed a notice that it intended, pursuant to Evid.R. 404(B), to use evidence of Barrow’s involvement in and conviction for another kidnapping. At trial, the state sought to introduce this evidence through testimony by Sergeant Howard Grant. Just prior to Grant’s testimony, defense counsel asked for a sidebar conference. He requested that the trial court provide a limiting instruction. The trial court stated that it would give a limiting instruction that the state was offering the testimony to show modus operandi and identity, to show that Barrow’s actions were purposeful, and that Barrow’s involvement was not part of a scheme with George. Grant then testified that he became aware that police were investigating an ongoing kidnapping and were concerned for the victim’s safety. He informed Detective Hilbert, the investigating officer, that six to seven months earlier he had investigated two kidnappings that were similar to the one Detective Hilbert was investigating. At that point, the trial court, at the state's request, gave the jury the following limiting instruction: ‘Evidence is about to be received about the commission of crimes or other acts other than the offense with which the defendant, Mr. Barrow, is charged in this trial. That evidence is being received only for a limited purpose. It is not received and you may not consider it to prove the character of the defendant in order to show that he acted in conformity with that character.

Specifically, McGuire argues that if the position of Mac’s body appeared in the video to be even slightly altered from how it was described by Officer Williams, the state’s entire theory of the case would have been disrupted. This assertion is without merit. Applying the *Brady* analysis laid out above, McGuire’s claim here fails. Courts have consistently rejected *Brady* claims that are too speculative, requiring defendants to substantiate claims that the evidence in question was favorable and material. *See State v. Hancock*, 108 Ohio St.3d 57, 2006-Ohio-160, 840 N.E.2d 1032, *State v. Hanna*, 95 Ohio St.3d 285, 2002-Ohio-2221, 767 N.E.2d 678, *State v. Hughes*, 8th Dist.

Not only is McGuire’s assertion that the body camera evidence might have supported a claim of self-defense speculative, it also ignores other evidence in the record that would refute such a theory — specifically, the location of the bullet wounds and the path of the bullets through Mac’s body. The bullets entered Mac’s body through the back of his thighs and pelvis and traveled up and across his body, with one bullet reaching his liver and another piercing his lung. The medical examiner explained in his testimony that this was consistent with the victim laying down in the vehicle with his legs up in a defensive posture. Such a position is also consistent with the eyewitness testimony of Sultan Muhammad. Finally, McGuire made statements to the police from the time of his arrest and through trial that he did not possess a gun and was not at the crime scene when Mac was shot. Therefore, even if body camera evidence existed that supported a self-defense theory of the case, McGuire is unable to show how he was prejudiced by this alleged Brady violation.\"\n}\n```"}

Blanton Jr.", "allegation_num": "allegation_1", "allegation": "DEFENDANT-APPELLANT’S CONVICTION FOR FELONIOUS ASSAULT IS NOT SUPPORTED BY SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO SATISFY THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE DUE PROCESS CLAUSE OF THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT TO THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION.", "discussion": "```json\n{\n  \"discussion\": \"Appellant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support his conviction for felonious assault. Appellant argues his conviction is not supported by sufficient evidence beyond a reasonable doubt to prove he acted either as a principal offender or as a collective participant, given the video evidence and testimony regarding the timing of Lunsford’s being ‘sucker punched’ by one of the other inmates. The court finds the evidence sufficient to support the conviction, as the testimony and video footage demonstrate Appellant’s awareness of the probability that his conduct would result in serious physical harm to Lunsford. The court also finds that Appellant was an active participant in the actual physical violence. The court finds the facts and circumstances indicate Appellant’s awareness of the probability that his conduct would result in serious physical harm to Lunsford. Appellant is responsible for the natural and foreseeable consequences that follow in the ordinary course of events unfolding as a result of Appellant’s actions as instigator of the June 18, 2016 altercation. Furthermore, the facts and circumstances demonstrate Appellant was an active participant in the actual physical violence. The court finds an earlier decision in our district, State v. Johnson, 4th Dist. Scioto No. 13CA3580, 2014-Ohio-4443, involving an altercation in a prison, to be instructive. There, Johnson claimed that despite the fact that he hit his victim in the face, the evidence was clear that the injuries to his victim’s shoulder and head were not from Johnson’s punch, but from a fall to the ground or possibly from the unrest that ensued after prison guards intervened in the prison fight. Johnson argued that the evidence failed to demonstrate that he knowingly caused serious physical harm to his victim, Officer Meier. Johnson pointed out while he may have knowingly caused physical harm to the officer in starting the incident by punching him in the head, it was the officer who escalated the incident by attempting to throw Johnson to the floor. The appellate court reasoned, however: ‘it is a fundamental principle that a person is presumed to intend the natural, reasonable and probable consequences of his voluntary acts.’ Johnson, supra, at ¶ 18, quoting State v. Conway, 108 Ohio St.3d 214, 2006–Ohio–791, 842 N.E.2d 966, ¶ 143. (Internal citations omitted.) ‘[T]he jury, unable to enter the mind of another, is required to consider common-sense, causal probabilities in considering whether the defendant acted ‘knowingly.’’ State v. Kelly, 11th Dist. Portage No. 2010–P–0049, 2012–Ohio–523, ¶ 23. We observed it was ‘unquestioned’ that Johnson set into motion the sequence of events which resulted in serious physical harm to the officer. Furthermore, the jury could have reasonably inferred from those punches themselves that Johnson had caused serious physical harm to Meier resulting in his closed-head injury and recurring, debilitating headaches. Id. at 19.3 (Emphasis added.) We reasoned: ‘More importantly, Johnson could have reasonably foreseen that his unprovoked inmate attack on a prison guard would result in the guard he assaulted and other guards following prison protocol by attempting to restrain him by taking him down to the ground. Meier's injuries were consequently reasonably foreseeable to Johnson and they would not have occurred if Johnson had not started the altercation by punching Meier.’ Johnson, supra, at ¶ 21. ‘For the causation element, we noted the following in Smith at ¶ 24–26: Courts generally treat the issue of legal causation in the criminal context similarly to that in tort cases because the situations are closely analogous. See, generally, LaFave Substantive Criminal Law (2003), 2nd Ed., Section 6.4(c). When dealing with claims of intervening causation, the proper analysis starts with a determination of whether the intervening act was a mere coincidence or alternatively, a response to the accused's prior conduct. Id. at 6.4(f). * * * An intervening act is a response to the prior acts of the defendant where it involves reaction to the condition created by the defendant.* * * [T]he law will impose a less exacting standard of legal causation where the intervening cause is a response rather than a coincidence. A coincidence will break the chain of legal causation if it was unforeseeable.’ Johnson, supra, at ¶ 26. Even if Meier's actions constituted intervening acts, they were a reasonable, foreseeable response to the repeated punches by Johnson to his head rather than a mere coincidence. Because Meier's actions in attempting to restrain and neutralize Johnson were neither abnormal nor unforeseeable, they did not break the chain of causation so as to relieve Johnson from criminal liability for felonious assault related to the serious physical injuries incurred by Meier. *Id.* at 22. We held at ¶ 23, ‘Although Meier's injuries may not have been the “immediate or most obvious result” of Johnson's initial punches to Meier's head, they were the “natural and foreseeable consequences” of the actions that followed “in the ordinary course of events.” Therefore, we held after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, there was sufficient evidence for a rational trier of fact to find that the essential elements of felonious assault had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. “The uncontroverted evidence was sufficient for the jury to determine that Johnson knowingly caused serious physical harm to Meier during his prison attack.” *Id.* at 24. Likewise, we hold that after viewing the evidence in light most favorable to the prosecution, there was sufficient evidence for a rational trier of fact to find that the essential elements of felonious assault had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Given the testimony that Appellant was the instigator, and “egged on” the fighting, it is unquestioned that Appellant, like Johnson, set into motion the sequence of events which resulted in serious physical harm to Lunsford. Like Johnson, Appellant could have reasonably foreseen that his creating the violent environment in the days leading up to the 18th and insisting that the men fight on the 18th, would result in the other inmates punching and kicking Lunsford. The other inmates’ actions constituted reasonable and foreseeable responses to Appellant’s initial actions in instigating the right. Another instructive case is In re Miller, 11th Dist. Ashtabula No. 2000-A-0014, 2002-Ohio-3360. Here, Miller, a juvenile convicted of felonious assault at a party, stressed the fact that the testimony establishes several other people were kicking the victim in the head before he became involved in the fight. The appellate court noted it was impossible to sort out which blow to the victim’s head caused what amount of damage and observed at ¶31: ‘[As to the persons kicking the victim] Those actions caused serious physical harm. Assuming, for purposes of this point, that they did, a party cannot then jump on top of the victim bargaining only for a “regular” assault by hitting the victim in a manner that may not, under normal circumstances, cause serious physical harm. If, in fact, appellant did not enter the melee until the victim had already suffered serious physical harm, his actions are all the more inculpatory. Harm heaped on top of serious physical harm must itself be considered serious physical harm even if under different circumstances it may not have risen to that level. It is impossible to sort out which blow to the victim's head caused what amount of damage. Those that assaulted him all contributed jointly in the harm the victim suffered.’ Here, Appellant’s argument assumes that the only serious physical harm Lunsford suffered was a ‘possible concussion’ after the sucker punch which rendered him, via eyewitness and admittedly not expert opinion, unconscious. We disagree. The surveillance footage demonstrates Lunsford was obviously weakened and had fallen down when Blanton administered repeated blows to Lunsford’s head. Mefford described Lunsford’s injuries as follows: Q: After seeing Mr. Blanton, Mr. McKee and Mr. Michaels strike Gary did Gary have any injuries? A: Yes, Ma’am. * * * A: I seen blood coming out of [Gary’s] nose and stuff and several lacerations around his face and head area. Lunsford was the taken to the Adams County Hospital. At trial, he identified State’s exhibits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7, photographs of his injuries which depicted two black eyes; bruising of his eyes, ear, neck, stomach, and back; a busted lip; and a gash on his head. Dr. Richard Durbin, the emergency room doctor who treated Lunsford at Adams County Regional Medical Center on June 21, 2016, testified Lunsford had ‘obvious’ injuries to his face, and gave a history of being ‘knocked unconscious.’ Based on the subjective history, Dr. Durbin ordered a CT scan of the head and x-rays of the left elbow and chest. He testified there were no fractures seen. On cross-examination, Dr. Durbin testified Appellant was discharged in ‘fair’ condition back to the jail with a diagnosis of soft tissue injuries to the head, face, left lateral chest wall and left elbow. He was advised to follow up with the physician at the jail. On redirect, Dr. Durbin testified he ‘believed’ that Lunsford sustained a concussion. Even if Appellant was not responsible for the blow which may or may not have rendered Lunsford unconscious and caused a ‘possible concussion,’ we find sufficient evidence that Appellant caused serious physical harm. In State v. Adams, 2016-Ohio-7772, 84 N.E.3d 1155, (4th Dist.), we observed: ‘The degree of harm that rises to the level of ‘serious’ physical harm is not an exact science, particularly when the definition includes such terms as ‘substantial,’ ‘temporary,’ ‘acute,’ and ‘prolonged.’ ’ Id. at 26, quoting State v. Mango, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 103146, 2016-Ohio-2935, ¶ 33. (Internal citations omitted.) The statute does not define ‘substantial suffering’; instead, the trier-of-fact must determine its existence from the facts of each particular case. State v. Bell, 1989 WL 10372, (Feb. 7, 1989), *2. (Internal citations omitted.) ‘Physical harm to persons’ means ‘any injury, illness, or other physiological impairment, regardless of its gravity or duration.’ R.C. 2901.01(A)(3) State v. Henry, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 10002634, 2016-Ohio-692, ¶ 40. The Henry court observed that serious physical harm has been found where a victim sustains a bloody cut and/or significant swelling to the face because this is sufficient to establish serious physical harm in that it constitutes ‘temporary, serious disfigurement.’ Id. at ¶ 42. Courts have also determined that ‘serious physical harm’ exists ‘‘where the injuries caused the victim to seek medical treatment.’ ’ Adams, supra, at ¶ 30, quoting Scott, supra, at ¶ 3. (Internal citations omitted.) Within his sufficiency argument, Appellant is quick to discredit the testimony of Lunsford and the other ‘criminals.’ We are mindful, however, ‘ ‘A jury, sitting as the trier of fact, is free to believe all, part or none of the testimony of any witness who appears before it.’ ’ State v. Reyes–Rosales, 4th Dist. Adams No. 15CA1010, 2016–Ohio–3338, ¶ 17, quoting State v. West, 4th Dist. Scioto No. 12CA3507, 2014–Ohio–1941, ¶ 23. ‘A sufficiency assignment of error challenges the legal adequacy of the State's prima facie case, not its rational persuasiveness.’ State v. Oldaker, 4th Dist. Meigs No. 16CA3, 2017-Ohio-1201, ¶ 41, quoting State v. Koon, 4th Dist. Hocking No. 15CA17, 2016–Ohio–416, ¶ 17. ‘That limited review does not intrude on the jury's role ‘to resolve conflicts in testimony, to weigh the evidence, and to draw reasonable inferences from basic facts to ultimate facts.’ ’ Musacchio v. United States, 84 U.S.L.W. 4077, 136 S.Ct. 709, 715 (2016), quoting Jackson at 319, 443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781. Any doubts one might have as to the credibility of the witnesses’ testimony is dispelled by the surveillance footage which demonstrates Appellant restarting the wrestling match between Lunsford and Gray, and then repeatedly and viciously striking Lunsford’s head later when he is lying on the floor. The jury further had the photographic depiction of Lunsford’s serious, temporary disfigurement to his face and body. We find any rational trier of fact could have found proven beyond reasonable doubt that Appellant acted knowingly and created serious physical harm to Lunsford. For the foregoing reasons, we find no merit to Appellant’s first assignment of error. It is hereby overruled.\"\n}\n```"}

Appellant argues his conviction is not supported by sufficient evidence beyond a reasonable doubt to prove he acted either as a principal offender or as a collective participant, given the video evidence and testimony regarding the timing of Lunsford’s being ‘sucker punched’ by one of the other inmates. The court finds the evidence sufficient to support the conviction, as the testimony and video footage demonstrate Appellant’s awareness of the probability that his conduct would result in serious physical harm to Lunsford. The court also finds that Appellant was an active participant in the actual physical violence. The court finds the facts and circumstances indicate Appellant’s awareness of the probability that his conduct would result in serious physical harm to Lunsford. Appellant is responsible for the natural and foreseeable consequences that follow in the ordinary course of events unfolding as a result of Appellant’s actions as instigator of the June 18, 2016 altercation. Furthermore, the facts and circumstances demonstrate Appellant was an active participant in the actual physical violence. The court finds an earlier decision in our district, State v. Johnson, 4th Dist. Scioto No. 13CA3580, 2014-Ohio-4443, involving an altercation in a prison, to be instructive. There, Johnson claimed that despite the fact that he hit his victim in the face, the evidence was clear that the injuries to his victim’s shoulder and head were not from Johnson’s punch, but from a fall to the ground or possibly from the unrest that ensued after prison guards intervened in the prison fight. Johnson argued that the evidence failed to demonstrate that he knowingly caused serious physical harm to his victim, Officer Meier. Johnson pointed out while he may have knowingly caused physical harm to the officer in starting the incident by punching him in the head, it was the officer who escalated the incident by attempting to throw Johnson to the floor. The appellate court reasoned, however: ‘it is a fundamental principle that a person is presumed to intend the natural, reasonable and probable consequences of his voluntary acts.’ Johnson, supra, at ¶ 18, quoting State v. Conway, 108 Ohio St.3d 214, 2006–Ohio–791, 842 N.E.2d 966, ¶ 143. (Internal citations omitted.) ‘[T]he jury, unable to enter the mind of another, is required to consider common-sense, causal probabilities in considering whether the defendant acted ‘knowingly.’’ State v. Kelly, 11th Dist. Portage No. 2010–P–0049, 2012–Ohio–523, ¶ 23. We observed it was ‘unquestioned’ that Johnson set into motion the sequence of events which resulted in serious physical harm to the officer. Furthermore, the jury could have reasonably inferred from those punches themselves that Johnson had caused serious physical harm to Meier resulting in his closed-head injury and recurring, debilitating headaches. Id. at 19.3 (Emphasis added.) We reasoned: ‘More importantly, Johnson could have reasonably foreseen that his unprovoked inmate attack on a prison guard would result in the guard he assaulted and other guards following prison protocol by attempting to restrain him by taking him down to the ground. Meier's injuries were consequently reasonably foreseeable to Johnson and they would not have occurred if Johnson had not started the altercation by punching Meier.’ Johnson, supra, at ¶ 21. ‘For the causation element, we noted the following in Smith at ¶ 24–26: Courts generally treat the issue of legal causation in the criminal context similarly to that in tort cases because the situations are closely analogous. See, generally, LaFave Substantive Criminal Law (2003), 2nd Ed., Section 6.4(c). When dealing with claims of intervening causation, the proper analysis starts with a determination of whether the intervening act was a mere coincidence or alternatively, a response to the accused's prior conduct. Id. at 6.4(f). * * * An intervening act is a response to the prior acts of the defendant where it involves reaction to the condition created by the defendant.* * * [T]he law will impose a less exacting standard of legal causation where the intervening cause is a response rather than a coincidence. A coincidence will break the chain of legal causation if it was unforeseeable.’ Johnson, supra, at ¶ 26. Even if Meier's actions constituted intervening acts, they were a reasonable, foreseeable response to the repeated punches by Johnson to his head rather than a mere coincidence. Because Meier's actions in attempting to restrain and neutralize Johnson were neither abnormal nor unforeseeable, they did not break the chain of causation so as to relieve Johnson from criminal liability for felonious assault related to the serious physical injuries incurred by Meier. *Id.* at 22. We held at ¶ 23, ‘Although Meier's injuries may not have been the “immediate or most obvious result” of Johnson's initial punches to Meier's head, they were the “natural and foreseeable consequences” of the actions that followed “in the ordinary course of events.” Therefore, we held after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, there was sufficient evidence for a rational trier of fact to find that the essential elements of felonious assault had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. “The uncontroverted evidence was sufficient for the jury to determine that Johnson knowingly caused serious physical harm to Meier during his prison attack.” *Id.* at 24. Likewise, we hold that after viewing the evidence in light most favorable to the prosecution, there was sufficient evidence for a rational trier of fact to find that the essential elements of felonious assault had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Given the testimony that Appellant was the instigator, and “egged on” the fighting, it is unquestioned that Appellant, like Johnson, set into motion the sequence of events which resulted in serious physical harm to Lunsford. Like Johnson, Appellant could have reasonably foreseen that his creating the violent environment in the days leading up to the 18th and insisting that the men fight on the 18th, would result in the other inmates punching and kicking Lunsford. The other inmates’ actions constituted reasonable and foreseeable responses to Appellant’s initial actions in instigating the right. Another instructive case is In re Miller, 11th Dist. Ashtabula No. 2000-A-0014, 2002-Ohio-3360. Here, Miller, a juvenile convicted of felonious assault at a party, stressed the fact that the testimony establishes several other people were kicking the victim in the head before he became involved in the fight. The appellate court noted it was impossible to sort out which blow to the victim’s head caused what amount of damage and observed at ¶31: ‘[As to the persons kicking the victim] Those actions caused serious physical harm. Assuming, for purposes of this point, that they did, a party cannot then jump on top of the victim bargaining only for a “regular” assault by hitting the victim in a manner that may not, under normal circumstances, cause serious physical harm. If, in fact, appellant did not enter the melee until the victim had already suffered serious physical harm, his actions are all the more inculpatory. Harm heaped on top of serious physical harm must itself be considered serious physical harm even if under different circumstances it may not have risen to that level. It is impossible to sort out which blow to the victim's head caused what amount of damage. Those that assaulted him all contributed jointly in the harm the victim suffered.’ Here, Appellant’s argument assumes that the only serious physical harm Lunsford suffered was a ‘possible concussion’ after the sucker punch which rendered him, via eyewitness and admittedly not expert opinion, unconscious. We disagree. The surveillance footage demonstrates Lunsford was obviously weakened and had fallen down when Blanton administered repeated blows to Lunsford’s head. Mefford described Lunsford’s injuries as follows: Q: After seeing Mr. Blanton, Mr. McKee and Mr. Michaels strike Gary did Gary have any injuries? A: Yes, Ma’am. * * * A: I seen blood coming out of [Gary’s] nose and stuff and several lacerations around his face and head area. Lunsford was the taken to the Adams County Hospital. At trial, he identified State’s exhibits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7, photographs of his injuries which depicted two black eyes; bruising of his eyes, ear, neck, stomach, and back; a busted lip; and a gash on his head. Dr. Richard Durbin, the emergency room doctor who treated Lunsford at Adams County Regional Medical Center on June 21, 2016, testified Lunsford had ‘obvious’ injuries to his face, and gave a history of being ‘knocked unconscious.’ Based on the subjective history, Dr. Durbin ordered a CT scan of the head and x-rays of the left elbow and chest. He testified there were no fractures seen. On cross-examination, Dr. Durbin testified Appellant was discharged in ‘fair’ condition back to the jail with a diagnosis of soft tissue injuries to the head, face, left lateral chest wall and left elbow. He was advised to follow up with the physician at the jail. On redirect, Dr. Durbin testified he ‘believed’ that Lunsford sustained a concussion. Even if Appellant was not responsible for the blow which may or may not have rendered Lunsford unconscious and caused a ‘possible concussion,’ we find sufficient evidence that Appellant caused serious physical harm. In State v. Adams, 2016-Ohio-7772, 84 N.E.3d 1155, (4th Dist.), we observed: ‘The degree of harm that rises to the level of ‘serious’ physical harm is not an exact science, particularly when the definition includes such terms as ‘substantial,’ ‘temporary,’ ‘acute,’ and ‘prolonged.’ ’ Id. at 26, quoting State v. Mango, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 103146, 2016-Ohio-2935, ¶ 33. (Internal citations omitted.) The statute does not define ‘substantial suffering’; instead, the trier-of-fact must determine its existence from the facts of each particular case. State v. Bell, 1989 WL 10372, (Feb. 7, 1989), *2. (Internal citations omitted.) ‘Physical harm to persons’ means ‘any injury, illness, or other physiological impairment, regardless of its gravity or duration.’ R.C. 2901.01(A)(3) State v. Henry, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 10002634, 2016-Ohio-692, ¶ 40. The Henry court observed that serious physical harm has been found where a victim sustains a bloody cut and/or significant swelling to the face because this is sufficient to establish serious physical harm in that it constitutes ‘temporary, serious disfigurement.’ Id. at ¶ 42. Courts have also determined that ‘serious physical harm’ exists ‘‘where the injuries caused the victim to seek medical treatment.’ ’ Adams, supra, at ¶ 30, quoting Scott, supra, at ¶ 3. (Internal citations omitted.) Within his sufficiency argument, Appellant is quick to discredit the testimony of Lunsford and the other ‘criminals.’ We are mindful, however, ‘ ‘A jury, sitting as the trier of fact, is free to believe all, part or none of the testimony of any witness who appears before it.’ ’ State v. Reyes–Rosales, 4th Dist. Adams No. 15CA1010, 2016–Ohio–3338, ¶ 17, quoting State v. West, 4th Dist. Scioto No. 12CA3507, 2014–Ohio–1941, ¶ 23. ‘A sufficiency assignment of error challenges the legal adequacy of the State's prima facie case, not its rational persuasiveness.’ State v. Oldaker, 4th Dist. Meigs No. 16CA3, 2017-Ohio-1201, ¶ 41, quoting State v. Koon, 4th Dist. Hocking No. 15CA17, 2016–Ohio–416, ¶ 17. ‘That limited review does not intrude on the jury's role ‘to resolve conflicts in testimony, to weigh the evidence, and to draw reasonable inferences from basic facts to ultimate facts.’ ’ Musacchio v. United States, 84 U.S.L.W. 4077, 136 S.Ct. 709, 715 (2016), quoting Jackson at 319, 443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781. Any doubts one might have as to the credibility of the witnesses’ testimony is dispelled by the surveillance footage which demonstrates Appellant restarting the wrestling match between Lunsford and Gray, and then repeatedly and viciously striking Lunsford’s head later when he is lying on the floor. The jury further had the photographic depiction of Lunsford’s serious, temporary disfigurement to his face and body. We find any rational trier of fact could have found proven beyond reasonable doubt that Appellant acted knowingly and created serious physical harm to Lunsford. For the foregoing reasons, we find no merit to Appellant’s first assignment of error. It is hereby overruled.\"\n}\n```"}

Harm heaped on top of serious physical harm must itself be considered serious physical harm even if under different circumstances it may not have risen to that level. It is impossible to sort out which blow to the victim's head caused what amount of damage. Those that assaulted him all contributed jointly in the harm the victim suffered.’ Here, Appellant’s argument assumes that the only serious physical harm Lunsford suffered was a ‘possible concussion’ after the sucker punch which rendered him, via eyewitness and admittedly not expert opinion, unconscious. We disagree. The surveillance footage demonstrates Lunsford was obviously weakened and had fallen down when Blanton administered repeated blows to Lunsford’s head. Mefford described Lunsford’s injuries as follows: Q: After seeing Mr. Blanton, Mr. McKee and Mr. Michaels strike Gary did Gary have any injuries? A: Yes, Ma’am. * * * A: I seen blood coming out of [Gary’s] nose and stuff and several lacerations around his face and head area. Lunsford was the taken to the Adams County Hospital. At trial, he identified State’s exhibits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7, photographs of his injuries which depicted two black eyes; bruising of his eyes, ear, neck, stomach, and back; a busted lip; and a gash on his head. Dr. Richard Durbin, the emergency room doctor who treated Lunsford at Adams County Regional Medical Center on June 21, 2016, testified Lunsford had ‘obvious’ injuries to his face, and gave a history of being ‘knocked unconscious.’ Based on the subjective history, Dr. Durbin ordered a CT scan of the head and x-rays of the left elbow and chest. He testified there were no fractures seen. On cross-examination, Dr. Durbin testified Appellant was discharged in ‘fair’ condition back to the jail with a diagnosis of soft tissue injuries to the head, face, left lateral chest wall and left elbow. He was advised to follow up with the physician at the jail. On redirect, Dr. Durbin testified he ‘believed’ that Lunsford sustained a concussion. Even if Appellant was not responsible for the blow which may or may not have rendered Lunsford unconscious and caused a ‘possible concussion,’ we find sufficient evidence that Appellant caused serious physical harm. In State v. Adams, 2016-Ohio-7772, 84 N.E.3d 1155, (4th Dist.), we observed: ‘The degree of harm that rises to the level of ‘serious’ physical harm is not an exact science, particularly when the definition includes such terms as ‘substantial,’ ‘temporary,’ ‘acute,’ and ‘prolonged.’ ’ Id. at 26, quoting State v. Mango, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 103146, 2016-Ohio-2935, ¶ 33. (Internal citations omitted.)

Appellant argues his conviction is not supported by sufficient evidence beyond a reasonable doubt to prove he acted either as a principal offender or as a collective participant, given the video evidence and testimony regarding the timing of Lunsford’s being ‘sucker punched’ by one of the other inmates. The court finds the evidence sufficient to support the conviction, as the testimony and video footage demonstrate Appellant’s awareness of the probability that his conduct would result in serious physical harm to Lunsford. The court also finds that Appellant was an active participant in the actual physical violence. The court finds the facts and circumstances indicate Appellant’s awareness of the probability that his conduct would result in serious physical harm to Lunsford. Appellant is responsible for the natural and foreseeable consequences that follow in the ordinary course of events unfolding as a result of Appellant’s actions as instigator of the June 18, 2016 altercation. Furthermore, the facts and circumstances demonstrate Appellant was an active participant in the actual physical violence. The court finds an earlier decision in our district, State v. Johnson, 4th Dist. Scioto No. 13CA3580, 2014-Ohio-4443, involving an altercation in a prison, to be instructive. There, Johnson claimed that despite the fact that he hit his victim in the face, the evidence was clear that the injuries to his victim’s shoulder and head were not from Johnson’s punch, but from a fall to the ground or possibly from the unrest that ensued after prison guards intervened in the prison fight. Johnson argued that the evidence failed to demonstrate that he knowingly caused serious physical harm to his victim, Officer Meier. Johnson pointed out while he may have knowingly caused physical harm to the officer in starting the incident by punching him in the head, it was the officer who escalated the incident by attempting to throw Johnson to the floor. The appellate court reasoned, however: ‘it is a fundamental principle that a person is presumed to intend the natural, reasonable and probable consequences of his voluntary acts.’ Johnson, supra, at ¶ 18, quoting State v. Conway, 108 Ohio St.3d 214, 2006–Ohio–791, 842 N.E.2d 966, ¶ 143. (Internal citations omitted.) ‘[T]he jury, unable to enter the mind of another, is required to consider common-sense, causal probabilities in considering whether the defendant acted ‘knowingly.’’ State v. Kelly, 11th Dist. Portage No. 2010–P–0049, 2012–Ohio–523, ¶ 23. We observed it was ‘unquestioned’ that Johnson set into motion the sequence of events which resulted in serious physical harm to the officer. Furthermore, the jury could have reasonably inferred from those punches themselves that Johnson had caused serious physical harm to Meier resulting in his closed-head injury and recurring, debilitating headaches. Id. at 19.3 (Emphasis added.) We reasoned: ‘More importantly, Johnson could have reasonably foreseen that his unprovoked inmate attack on a prison guard would result in the guard he assaulted and other guards following prison protocol by attempting to restrain him by taking him down to the ground. Meier's injuries were consequently reasonably foreseeable to Johnson and they would not have occurred if Johnson had not started the altercation by punching Meier.’ Johnson, supra, at ¶ 21. ‘For the causation element, we noted the following in Smith at ¶ 24–26: Courts generally treat the issue of legal causation in the criminal context similarly to that in tort cases because the situations are closely analogous. See, generally, LaFave Substantive Criminal Law (2003), 2nd Ed., Section 6.4(c). When dealing with claims of intervening causation, the proper analysis starts with a determination of whether the intervening act was a mere coincidence or alternatively, a response to the accused's prior conduct. Id. at 6.4(f). * * * An intervening act is a response to the prior acts of the defendant where it involves reaction to the condition created by the defendant.* * * [T]he law will impose a less exacting standard of legal causation where the intervening cause is a response rather than a coincidence. A coincidence will break the chain of legal causation if it was unforeseeable.’ Johnson, supra, at ¶ 26. Even if Meier's actions constituted intervening acts, they were a reasonable, foreseeable response to the repeated punches by Johnson to his head rather than a mere coincidence. Because Meier's actions in attempting to restrain and neutralize Johnson were neither abnormal nor unforeseeable, they did not break the chain of causation so as to relieve Johnson from criminal liability for felonious assault related to the serious physical injuries incurred by Meier. *Id.* at 22. We held at ¶ 23, ‘Although Meier's injuries may not have been the “immediate or most obvious result” of Johnson's initial punches to Meier's head, they were the “natural and foreseeable consequences” of the actions that followed “in the ordinary course of events.” Therefore, we held after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, there was sufficient evidence for a rational trier of fact to find that the essential elements of felonious assault had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. “The uncontroverted evidence was sufficient for the jury to determine that Johnson knowingly caused serious physical harm to Meier during his prison attack.” *Id.* at 24. Likewise, we hold that after viewing the evidence in light most favorable to the prosecution, there was sufficient evidence for a rational trier of fact to find that the essential elements of felonious assault had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Given the testimony that Appellant was the instigator, and “egged on” the fighting, it is unquestioned that Appellant, like Johnson, set into motion the sequence of events which resulted in serious physical harm to Lunsford. Like Johnson, Appellant could have reasonably foreseen that his creating the violent environment in the days leading up to the 18th and insisting that the men fight on the 18th, would result in the other inmates punching and kicking Lunsford. The other inmates’ actions constituted reasonable and foreseeable responses to Appellant’s initial actions in instigating the right. Another instructive case is In re Miller, 11th Dist. Ashtabula No. 2000-A-0014, 2002-Ohio-3360. Here, Miller, a juvenile convicted of felonious assault at a party, stressed the fact that the testimony establishes several other people were kicking the victim in the head before he became involved in the fight. The appellate court noted it was impossible to sort out which blow to the victim’s head caused what amount of damage and observed at ¶31: ‘[As to the persons kicking the victim] Those actions caused serious physical harm. Assuming, for purposes of this point, that they did, a party cannot then jump on top of the victim bargaining only for a “regular” assault by hitting the victim in a manner that may not, under normal circumstances, cause serious physical harm. If, in fact, appellant did not enter the melee until the victim had already suffered serious physical harm, his actions are all the more inculpatory. Harm heaped on top of serious physical harm must itself be considered serious physical harm even if under different circumstances it may not have risen to that level. It is impossible to sort out which blow to the victim's head caused what amount of damage. Those that assaulted him all contributed jointly in the harm the victim suffered.’ Here, Appellant’s argument assumes that the only serious physical harm Lunsford suffered was a ‘possible concussion’ after the sucker punch which rendered him, via eyewitness and admittedly not expert opinion, unconscious. We disagree. The surveillance footage demonstrates Lunsford was obviously weakened and had fallen down when Blanton administered repeated blows to Lunsford’s head. Mefford described Lunsford’s injuries as follows: Q: After seeing Mr. Blanton, Mr. McKee and Mr. Michaels strike Gary did Gary have any injuries?

The court finds the evidence sufficient to support the conviction, as the testimony and video footage demonstrate Appellant’s awareness of the probability that his conduct would result in serious physical harm to Lunsford. The court also finds that Appellant was an active participant in the actual physical violence. The court finds the facts and circumstances indicate Appellant’s awareness of the probability that his conduct would result in serious physical harm to Lunsford. Appellant is responsible for the natural and foreseeable consequences that follow in the ordinary course of events unfolding as a result of Appellant’s actions as instigator of the June 18, 2016 altercation. Furthermore, the facts and circumstances demonstrate Appellant was an active participant in the actual physical violence. The court finds an earlier decision in our district, State v. Johnson, 4th Dist. Scioto No. 13CA3580, 2014-Ohio-4443, involving an altercation in a prison, to be instructive. There, Johnson claimed that despite the fact that he hit his victim in the face, the evidence was clear that the injuries to his victim’s shoulder and head were not from Johnson’s punch, but from a fall to the ground or possibly from the unrest that ensued after prison guards intervened in the prison fight. Johnson argued that the evidence failed to demonstrate that he knowingly caused serious physical harm to his victim, Officer Meier. Johnson pointed out while he may have knowingly caused physical harm to the officer in starting the incident by punching him in the head, it was the officer who escalated the incident by attempting to throw Johnson to the floor. The appellate court reasoned, however: ‘it is a fundamental principle that a person is presumed to intend the natural, reasonable and probable consequences of his voluntary acts.’ Johnson, supra, at ¶ 18, quoting State v. Conway, 108 Ohio St.3d 214, 2006–Ohio–791, 842 N.E.2d 966, ¶ 143. (Internal citations omitted.) ‘[T]he jury, unable to enter the mind of another, is required to consider common-sense, causal probabilities in considering whether the defendant acted ‘knowingly.’’ State v. Kelly, 11th Dist. Portage No. 2010–P–0049, 2012–Ohio–523, ¶ 23. We observed it was ‘unquestioned’ that Johnson set into motion the sequence of events which resulted in serious physical harm to the officer. Furthermore, the jury could have reasonably inferred from those punches themselves that Johnson had caused serious physical harm to Meier resulting in his closed-head injury and recurring, debilitating headaches. Id. at 19.3 (Emphasis added.) We reasoned: ‘More importantly, Johnson could have reasonably foreseen that his unprovoked inmate attack on a prison guard would result in the guard he assaulted and other guards following prison protocol by attempting to restrain him by taking him down to the ground. Meier's injuries were consequently reasonably foreseeable to Johnson and they would not have occurred if Johnson had not started the altercation by punching Meier.’ Johnson, supra, at ¶ 21. ‘For the causation element, we noted the following in Smith at ¶ 24–26: Courts generally treat the issue of legal causation in the criminal context similarly to that in tort cases because the situations are closely analogous. See, generally, LaFave Substantive Criminal Law (2003), 2nd Ed., Section 6.4(c). When dealing with claims of intervening causation, the proper analysis starts with a determination of whether the intervening act was a mere coincidence or alternatively, a response to the accused's prior conduct. Id. at 6.4(f). * * * An intervening act is a response to the prior acts of the defendant where it involves reaction to the condition created by the defendant.* * * [T]he law will impose a less exacting standard of legal causation where the intervening cause is a response rather than a coincidence. A coincidence will break the chain of legal causation if it was unforeseeable.’ Johnson, supra, at ¶ 26. Even if Meier's actions constituted intervening acts, they were a reasonable, foreseeable response to the repeated punches by Johnson to his head rather than a mere coincidence. Because Meier's actions in attempting to restrain and neutralize Johnson were neither abnormal nor unforeseeable, they did not break the chain of causation so as to relieve Johnson from criminal liability for felonious assault related to the serious physical injuries incurred by Meier. *Id.* at 22. We held at ¶ 23, ‘Although Meier's injuries may not have been the “immediate or most obvious result” of Johnson's initial punches to Meier's head, they were the “natural and foreseeable consequences” of the actions that followed “in the ordinary course of events.” Therefore, we held after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, there was sufficient evidence for a rational trier of fact to find that the essential elements of felonious assault had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. “The uncontroverted evidence was sufficient for the jury to determine that Johnson knowingly caused serious physical harm to Meier during his prison attack.” *Id.* at 24. Likewise, we hold that after viewing the evidence in light most favorable to the prosecution, there was sufficient evidence for a rational trier of fact to find that the essential elements of felonious assault had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Given the testimony that Appellant was the instigator, and “egged on” the fighting, it is unquestioned that Appellant, like Johnson, set into motion the sequence of events which resulted in serious physical harm to Lunsford. Like Johnson, Appellant could have reasonably foreseen that his creating the violent environment in the days leading up to the 18th and insisting that the men fight on the 18th, would result in the other inmates punching and kicking Lunsford. The other inmates’ actions constituted reasonable and foreseeable responses to Appellant’s initial actions in instigating the right. Another instructive case is In re Miller, 11th Dist. Ashtabula No. 2000-A-0014, 2002-Ohio-3360. Here, Miller, a juvenile convicted of felonious assault at a party, stressed the fact that the testimony establishes several other people were kicking the victim in the head before he became involved in the fight. The appellate court noted it was impossible to sort out which blow to the victim’s head caused what amount of damage and observed at ¶31: ‘[As to the persons kicking the victim] Those actions caused serious physical harm. Assuming, for purposes of this point, that they did, a party cannot then jump on top of the victim bargaining only for a “regular” assault by hitting the victim in a manner that may not, under normal circumstances, cause serious physical harm. If, in fact, appellant did not enter the melee until the victim had already suffered serious physical harm, his actions are all the more inculpatory. Harm heaped on top of serious physical harm must itself be considered serious physical harm even if under different circumstances it may not have risen to that level. It is impossible to sort out which blow to the victim's head caused what amount of damage. Those that assaulted him all contributed jointly in the harm the victim suffered.’ Here, Appellant’s argument assumes that the only serious physical harm Lunsford suffered was a ‘possible concussion’ after the sucker punch which rendered him, via eyewitness and admittedly not expert opinion, unconscious. We disagree. The surveillance footage demonstrates Lunsford was obviously weakened and had fallen down when Blanton administered repeated blows to Lunsford’s head. Mefford described Lunsford’s injuries as follows: Q: After seeing Mr. Blanton, Mr. McKee and Mr. Michaels strike Gary did Gary have any injuries? A: Yes, Ma’am. * * * A: I seen blood coming out of [Gary’s] nose and stuff and several lacerations around his face and head area. Lunsford was the taken to the Adams County Hospital. At trial, he identified State’s exhibits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7, photographs of his injuries which depicted two black eyes; bruising of his eyes, ear, neck, stomach, and back; a busted lip; and a gash on his head. Dr. Richard Durbin, the emergency room doctor who treated Lunsford at Adams County Regional Medical Center on June 21, 2016, testified Lunsford had ‘obvious’ injuries to his face, and gave a history of being ‘knocked unconscious.’ Based on the subjective history, Dr. Durbin ordered a CT scan of the head and x-rays of the left elbow and chest. He testified there were no fractures seen. On cross-examination, Dr. Durbin testified Appellant was discharged in ‘fair’ condition back to the jail with a diagnosis of soft tissue injuries to the head, face, left lateral chest wall and left elbow. He was advised to follow up with the physician at the jail. On redirect, Dr. Durbin testified he ‘believed’ that Lunsford sustained a concussion. Even if Appellant was not responsible for the blow which may or may not have rendered Lunsford unconscious and caused a ‘possible concussion,’ we find sufficient evidence that Appellant caused serious physical harm. In State v. Adams, 2016-Ohio-7772, 84 N.E.3d 1155, (4th Dist.), we observed: ‘The degree of harm that rises to the level of ‘serious’ physical harm is not an exact science, particularly when the definition includes such terms as ‘substantial,’ ‘temporary,’ ‘acute,’ and ‘prolonged.’ ’ Id. at 26, quoting State v. Mango, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 103146, 2016-Ohio-2935, ¶ 33. (Internal citations omitted.) The statute does not define ‘substantial suffering’; instead, the trier-of-fact must determine its existence from the facts of each particular case. State v. Bell, 1989 WL 10372, (Feb. 7, 1989), *2. (Internal citations omitted.) ‘Physical harm to persons’ means ‘any injury, illness, or other physiological impairment, regardless of its gravity or duration.’ R.C. 2901.01(A)(3) State v. Henry, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 10002634, 2016-Ohio-692, ¶ 40. The Henry court observed that serious physical harm has been found where a victim sustains a bloody cut and/or significant swelling to the face because this is sufficient to establish serious physical harm in that it constitutes ‘temporary, serious disfigurement.’ Id. at ¶ 42. Courts have also determined that ‘serious physical harm’ exists ‘‘where the injuries caused the victim to seek medical treatment.’ ’ Adams, supra, at ¶ 30, quoting Scott, supra, at ¶ 3. (Internal citations omitted.) Within his sufficiency argument, Appellant is quick to discredit the testimony of Lunsford and the other ‘criminals.’ We are mindful, however, ‘ ‘A jury, sitting as the trier of fact, is free to believe all, part or none of the testimony of any witness who appears before it.’ ’ State v. Reyes–Rosales, 4th Dist. Adams No. 15CA1010, 2016–Ohio–3338, ¶ 17, quoting State v. West, 4th Dist. Scioto No. 12CA3507, 2014–Ohio–1941, ¶ 23. ‘A sufficiency assignment of error challenges the legal adequacy of the State's prima facie case, not its rational persuasiveness.’ State v. Oldaker, 4th Dist. Meigs No. 16CA3, 2017-Ohio-1201, ¶ 41, quoting State v. Koon, 4th Dist. Hocking No. 15CA17, 2016–Ohio–416, ¶ 17. ‘That limited review does not intrude on the jury's role ‘to resolve conflicts in testimony, to weigh the evidence, and to draw reasonable inferences from basic facts to ultimate facts.’ ’ Musacchio v. United States, 84 U.S.L.W. 4077, 136 S.Ct. 709, 715 (2016), quoting Jackson at 319, 443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781. Any doubts one might have as to the credibility of the witnesses’ testimony is dispelled by the surveillance footage which demonstrates Appellant restarting the wrestling match between Lunsford and Gray, and then repeatedly and viciously striking Lunsford’s head later when he is lying on the floor. The jury further had the photographic depiction of Lunsford’s serious, temporary disfigurement to his face and body. We find any rational trier of fact could have found proven beyond reasonable doubt that Appellant acted knowingly and created serious physical harm to Lunsford. For the foregoing reasons, we find no merit to Appellant’s first assignment of error. It is hereby overruled.\"\n}\n```"}

In the course of arguing these issues, he also takes issue with the way in which the state obtained cell phone records. This court’s review of a decision on a motion to suppress is a mixed question of law and fact. The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution protects people from illegal searches and seizures. In order to employ Fourth Amendment protections, a defendant must have a 'constitutionally protected reasonable expectation of privacy.' Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 360, 88 S.Ct. 507, 19 L.Ed.2d 576 (1967). The United States Supreme Court has directed reviewing courts to consider a two-part test in order to determine whether the Fourth Amendment is implicated. 'First, has the individual manifested a subjective expectation of privacy in the object of the challenged search? Second, is society willing to recognize that expectation as reasonable?' California v. Ciraolo, 476 U.S. 207, 211, 106 S.Ct. 1809, 90 L.Ed.2d 210 (1986), citing Katz at 360. To the extent appellant challenges the decision related to the search warrants for the attachment of a GPS tracking device, this court cannot properly address those arguments. Appellant’s initial suppression motion references the warrants and accompanying affidavits, but those documents were not attached. At the suppression hearing, appellant did not introduce those documents as exhibits. As a result, those documents were not before the trial court at the appropriate time. We cannot discern the merit of appellant’s arguments without these documents. Statements made in a search warrant affidavit enjoy a presumption of validity. State v. Taylor, 174 Ohio App.3d 477, 2007-Ohio-7066, 882 N.E.2d 945 (1st Dist.). Without evidence to the contrary, this court is bound to find the statements made in the affidavit valid and, thus, the warrants valid. The evidence adduced at the suppression hearing indicated that police were investigating an incident where a person cashed fraudulent checks made to resemble payroll checks. Officers interviewed an individual, D.H., and she provided them with a phone number that she says was used to contact her in order to arrange the provision of a fraudulent check to her. She indicated the person with whom she communicated was named 'Ike,' and the two had exchanged text messages and talked over the phone. With her permission, officers examined her phone and viewed the text messages that were exchanged between that phone number and the person being interviewed. Det. Duffy then approached a municipal court judge for an order directing the cell phone provider to release records related to the account. Det. Duffy relayed the steps in the investigation that had occurred and the statements made by the individual under the investigation. Det. Duffy did not disclose that this individual had a history of mental illness and was recently hospitalized for mental health treatment, and did not disclose that this individual lied about her current address. The judge issued a court order directing AT&T to produce subscriber records relating to the phone number provided, including address, call logs, location data, and text messages. Det. Duffy and Det. Witalis received information regarding the phone number from AT&T, and the subscriber information was not helpful. The account information provided did not include a name, and the address listed was a California address. Det. Witalis described the phone as a 'burner' or anonymous phone. Using information contained in the call logs, Det. Witalis testified that he determined, through the frequency of the calls and other information, that the phone was likely related to an address on Monticello Boulevard in Richmond Heights, Ohio. A records check revealed a car registration for a white Oldsmobile Aurora owned by a person at that address. Upon surveillance of that address, he observed a car that matched the description provided by D.H., a white Oldsmobile Aurora. First, the trial court held that appellant did not have an expectation of privacy because he denied being the owner of the phone, the subscriber using the phone, or associated with the phone in any way. For a person to have been aggrieved by an unlawful search or seizure, he or she'must have been a victim of a search or seizure, one against whom the search was directed, as distinguished from one who claims prejudice only through the use of evidence gathered as a consequence of a search or seizure directed at someone else.' State v. Crawford, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 98605, 2013-Ohio-1659, ¶ 45, quoting Alderman v. United States, 394 U.S. 165, 173, 89 S.Ct. 961, 22 L.Ed.2d 176 (1969), quoting Jones v. United States, 362 U.S. 257, 261, 80 S.Ct. 725, 4 L.Ed.2d 697 (1960). This, alone, is a basis to affirm the trial court’s decision. Appellant has maintained that these records do not pertain to him. Therefore, he would not be aggrieved by a search of these records. However, because the state has asserted that these are records that relate to appellant in that they pertain to a cell phone used by appellant, in an abundance of caution, this court will analyze the matter further. This court has previously found no privacy right exists for cell phone records maintained by a phone company. Id. at ¶ 47 ('telephone users have no right of privacy in the numerical information they convey to the telephone company. Courts have also held that this reasoning applies to cell phone records obtained from cell phone companies as well.'), citing State v. Neely, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 24317, 2012-Ohio-212; United States v. Dye, N.D.Ohio No. 1:10CR221, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 47287 (Apr. 27, 2011). Information that has been voluntarily turned over to third parties does not enjoy protection because a person does not have a legitimate expectation of privacy in such information. The Second District has reaffirmed its holding in Neely and found that an individual has no constitutional privacy interest in cell phone location data, or ping data, maintained by a cell phone carrier. State v. Taylor, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 25764, 2014-Ohio-2550. The request for information sent to the phone company in that case requested location data, call logs, and subscriber information. Id. at ¶ 8. The court order in the present case also sought text messages. The request for text messages could lead to the disclosure of metadata about appellant’s communications as well as the content of communications where a privacy interest may exist. 18 U.S.C.S. 2703(c) specifically limits its application to records of electronic communications, but subsection (b) provides for the release of the contents of communications of a remote computing service only with prior notice to the subscriber and other restrictions. It is unclear from the suppression hearing whether any contents of text messages were, in fact, turned over and, if they were, whether they were used against appellant in any manner. If the requested information turned over by the phone company was limited to the date, time, and phone numbers of exchanged text messages, then appellant would not have a privacy interest in that metadata. Det. Duffy testified that he used the call logs of the anonymous cell phone to link that number to others that were frequently called. Through an investigation of those numbers, using searches of publicly available information, he was able to identify a residential address that was in some way associated with the person that used the anonymous phone. An Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles search yielded a vehicle matching the description given to police that was also associated with the address. There is no indication that the contents of the communications to which appellant had a reasonable expectation of privacy were turned over as a result of the court order or, if the contents of text messages were turned over, were used in the investigation against appellant as a result of the court order. Appellant has the burden of at least prima facie establishing a violation of his Fourth Amendment right to privacy, and without showing that the contents of text messages were, in fact, turned over to police, appellant has not made that showing. Appellant argues that the records disclosed to police were not turned over in discovery. This court cannot review such a claim, but it is apparent that appellant did not ask the detectives that testified at the suppression hearing whether the contents of text messages were disclosed. Further, the records were not otherwise used at trial. Therefore, the trial court did not err in this respect when denying appellant’s motion to suppress. Appellant also argues that there were material omissions made to the judge issuing the order that should have resulted in a lack of reasonable suspicion. Generally, when this court is reviewing this type of issue, there is a search warrant affidavit that details the information relayed to the authorizing judge. In this case, there is no affidavit relating to the court order used to obtain cell phone records, but Det. Duffy testified about the information relayed to the issuing judge. Det. Duffy readily admitted that he did not disclose that the witness had lied to him about her residence, and that he did not disclose that she was recently hospitalized for mental illness. Appellant likens this to cases where a search warrant affidavit contained material misstatements or omissions, allegedly causing them to be fatally deficient. See Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154, 98 S.Ct. 2674, 57 L.Ed.2d 667 (1978). In those cases, 'a defendant who claims that a warrant is flawed because it is based upon a false statement must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the affiant made a false statement, either intentionally, or with reckless disregard for the truth.' State v. Tinsley, 2d Dist. No. 23542, 2010 Ohio 3535, ¶ 23, citing Franks [v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154, 155-156, 98 S.Ct. 2674, 57 L.Ed.2d 667 (1978)]. State v. Perry, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 97572, 2012-Ohio-4273, ¶ 15. The Perry court went on to note that 'even if the affidavit contains false statements [or omissions] made intentionally or recklessly, a warrant based on the affidavit is still valid unless, with the affidavit’s false material set to one side [or with the omissions included], the affidavit’s remaining content is insufficient to establish probable cause.' Id. at ¶ 16, quoting State v. Sells, 2d Dist. Miami No. 2005-CA-8, 2006-Ohio-1859, ¶ 11, citing State v. Waddy, 63 Ohio St.3d 424, 441, 588 N.E.2d 819 (1992). Here, this issuance of the court order for records is governed by a standard less than probable cause due to the lack of a privacy interest in the requested records. 18 U.S.C.S. 2703(d). According to this statute, the standard for the issuing judge is whether 'the governmental entity offers specific and articulable facts showing that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the contents of a wire or electronic communication, or the records or other information sought, are relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation.' This standard is similar to that fleshed out in the Terry line of cases. United States v. Warshak, 631 F.3d 266, 291 (6th Cir.2010), citing Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968). Under this standard, an investigative search is reasonable when the state actor is able to point to articulable facts that give rise to a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. State v. Eddy, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. Assuming for the sake of argument that appellant has standing and an interest in the cell phone records, even with the omissions appellant points out, there still exists a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity based on the factual recitation above. The GPS search warrants and affidavits are not attached to any of appellant’s suppression motions filed with the clerk. However, an undocketed, unfiled copy of appellant’s May 18, 2016 suppression motion is included in the lower court file. This document has hand-written notations and other irregularities. Therefore, given these limitations, this court will examine appellant’s arguments in light of these warrants and affidavits. Attached to a May 7, 2015 GPS warrant is an affidavit executed by Det. Witalis. There, he describes the investigation of several individuals passing bad checks and the individuals supplying these checks. The information provided by D.H. was set forth, including the phone contact she had with a person named 'Ike' and the fact that he drove a white Oldsmobile Aurora. Det. Witalis averred that he was able to use phone records from the number provided by D.H. to hone in on a person closely associated with that phone number that also owned a white Oldsmobile Aurora. Detectives and a secret service agent then met with D.H. again and she picked appellant out of a photo array and identified him as Ike. Further surveillance of the address that Det. Witalis identified as being closely related to the cell phone number provided by D.H. resulted in Det. Witalis observing appellant driving the white Oldsmobile Aurora. This court’s review is further hampered by the nature of the record in this case because there are two documents purporting to be GPS warrants issued on May 7, 2015, for the same vehicle and appear to be copies of the same warrant. However, the affidavit attached to each is different. The second May 7, 2015 search warrant affidavit avers similar statements, but also included that an officer had taken a statement from J.M. She was caught attempting to pass a fraudulent check and indicated that it was supplied to her by someone who identified himself by the name of 'Black' and drove a white Oldsmobile Aurora. A June 24, 2015 warrant for an extension of the original GPS warrant indicated that appellant’s vehicle was at several banks when attempts were made to pass fraudulent checks. Det. Witalis also averred that the vehicle visited a check cashing business — the same check cashing business that employed Bohanon — prior to visiting the various financial institutions where fraudulent checks were passed. Regardless, at the suppression hearing, appellant argued in his opening statement that the GPS warrant affidavits were deficient, but then failed to pursue the issue further at the suppression hearing. All the evidence adduced was in relation to the court order issued by a municipal court judge for phone records, not the GPS warrants that were issued by a common pleas court judge. Appellant adduced testimony that detectives failed to disclose facts about D.H. — she had a history of mental illness including recent hospitalization, and she lied to police about her address — but that was in the context of the court order to obtain cell phone records. As this court recognized in Perry, it is the defendant’s burden to demonstrate a material misstatement or omission in a search warrant affidavit under Franks. Perry, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 97572, 2012-Ohio-4273, ¶ 15. Appellant failed to do so at the suppression hearing. Therefore, appellant’s first assignment of error is overruled.\"\n}\n```"}

In the course of arguing these issues, he also takes issue with the way in which the state obtained cell phone records. This court’s review of a decision on a motion to suppress is a mixed question of law and fact. The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution protects people from illegal searches and seizures. In order to employ Fourth Amendment protections, a defendant must have a 'constitutionally protected reasonable expectation of privacy.' Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 360, 88 S.Ct. 507, 19 L.Ed.2d 576 (1967). The United States Supreme Court has directed reviewing courts to consider a two-part test in order to determine whether the Fourth Amendment is implicated. 'First, has the individual manifested a subjective expectation of privacy in the object of the challenged search? Second, is society willing to recognize that expectation as reasonable?' California v. Ciraolo, 476 U.S. 207, 211, 106 S.Ct. 1809, 90 L.Ed.2d 210 (1986), citing Katz at 360. To the extent appellant challenges the decision related to the search warrants for the attachment of a GPS tracking device, this court cannot properly address those arguments. Appellant’s initial suppression motion references the warrants and accompanying affidavits, but those documents were not attached. At the suppression hearing, appellant did not introduce those documents as exhibits. As a result, those documents were not before the trial court at the appropriate time. We cannot discern the merit of appellant’s arguments without these documents. Statements made in a search warrant affidavit enjoy a presumption of validity. State v. Taylor, 174 Ohio App.3d 477, 2007-Ohio-7066, 882 N.E.2d 945 (1st Dist.). Without evidence to the contrary, this court is bound to find the statements made in the affidavit valid and, thus, the warrants valid. The evidence adduced at the suppression hearing indicated that police were investigating an incident where a person cashed fraudulent checks made to resemble payroll checks. Officers interviewed an individual, D.H., and she provided them with a phone number that she says was used to contact her in order to arrange the provision of a fraudulent check to her. She indicated the person with whom she communicated was named 'Ike,' and the two had exchanged text messages and talked over the phone. With her permission, officers examined her phone and viewed the text messages that were exchanged between that phone number and the person being interviewed. Det. Duffy then approached a municipal court judge for an order directing the cell phone provider to release records related to the account. Det. Duffy relayed the steps in the investigation that had occurred and the statements made by the individual under the investigation. Det. Duffy did not disclose that this individual had a history of mental illness and was recently hospitalized for mental health treatment, and did not disclose that this individual lied about her current address. The judge issued a court order directing AT&T to produce subscriber records relating to the phone number provided, including address, call logs, location data, and text messages. Det. Duffy and Det. Witalis received information regarding the phone number from AT&T, and the subscriber information was not helpful. The account information provided did not include a name, and the address listed was a California address. Det. Witalis described the phone as a 'burner' or anonymous phone. Using information contained in the call logs, Det. Witalis testified that he determined, through the frequency of the calls and other information, that the phone was likely related to an address on Monticello Boulevard in Richmond Heights, Ohio. A records check revealed a car registration for a white Oldsmobile Aurora owned by a person at that address. Upon surveillance of that address, he observed a car that matched the description provided by D.H., a white Oldsmobile Aurora. First, the trial court held that appellant did not have an expectation of privacy because he denied being the owner of the phone, the subscriber using the phone, or associated with the phone in any way. For a person to have been aggrieved by an unlawful search or seizure, he or she'must have been a victim of a search or seizure, one against whom the search was directed, as distinguished from one who claims prejudice only through the use of evidence gathered as a consequence of a search or seizure directed at someone else.' State v. Crawford, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 98605, 2013-Ohio-1659, ¶ 45, quoting Alderman v. United States, 394 U.S. 165, 173, 89 S.Ct. 961, 22 L.Ed.2d 176 (1969), quoting Jones v. United States, 362 U.S. 257, 261, 80 S.Ct. 725, 4 L.Ed.2d 697 (1960). This, alone, is a basis to affirm the trial court’s decision. Appellant has maintained that these records do not pertain to him. Therefore, he would not be aggrieved by a search of these records. However, because the state has asserted that these are records that relate to appellant in that they pertain to a cell phone used by appellant, in an abundance of caution, this court will analyze the matter further. This court has previously found no privacy right exists for cell phone records maintained by a phone company. Id. at ¶ 47 ('telephone users have no right of privacy in the numerical information they convey to the telephone company. Courts have also held that this reasoning applies to cell phone records obtained from cell phone companies as well.'), citing State v. Neely, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 24317, 2012-Ohio-212; United States v. Dye, N.D.Ohio No. 1:10CR221, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 47287 (Apr. 27, 2011). Information that has been voluntarily turned over to third parties does not enjoy protection because a person does not have a legitimate expectation of privacy in such information. The Second District has reaffirmed its holding in Neely and found that an individual has no constitutional privacy interest in cell phone location data, or ping data, maintained by a cell phone carrier. State v. Taylor, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 25764, 2014-Ohio-2550. The request for information sent to the phone company in that case requested location data, call logs, and subscriber information. Id. at ¶ 8. The court order in the present case also sought text messages. The request for text messages could lead to the disclosure of metadata about appellant’s communications as well as the content of communications where a privacy interest may exist. 18 U.S.C.S. 2703(c) specifically limits its application to records of electronic communications, but subsection (b) provides for the release of the contents of communications of a remote computing service only with prior notice to the subscriber and other restrictions.

The Perry court went on to note that 'even if the affidavit contains false statements [or omissions] made intentionally or recklessly, a warrant based on the affidavit is still valid unless, with the affidavit’s false material set to one side [or with the omissions included], the affidavit’s remaining content is insufficient to establish probable cause.'

In this case, there is no affidavit relating to the court order used to obtain cell phone records, but Det. Duffy testified about the information relayed to the issuing judge. Det. Duffy readily admitted that he did not disclose that the witness had lied to him about her residence, and that he did not disclose that she was recently hospitalized for mental illness. Appellant likens this to cases where a search warrant affidavit contained material misstatements or omissions, allegedly causing them to be fatally deficient. See Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154, 98 S.Ct. 2674, 57 L.Ed.2d 667 (1978). In those cases, 'a defendant who claims that a warrant is flawed because it is based upon a false statement must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the affiant made a false statement, either intentionally, or with reckless disregard for the truth.' State v. Tinsley, 2d Dist. No. 23542, 2010 Ohio 3535, ¶ 23, citing Franks [v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154, 155-156, 98 S.Ct. 2674, 57 L.Ed.2d 667 (1978)]. State v. Perry, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 97572, 2012-Ohio-4273, ¶ 15. The Perry court went on to note that 'even if the affidavit contains false statements [or omissions] made intentionally or recklessly, a warrant based on the affidavit is still valid unless, with the affidavit’s false material set to one side [or with the omissions included], the affidavit’s remaining content is insufficient to establish probable cause.' Id. at ¶ 16, quoting State v. Sells, 2d Dist. Miami No. 2005-CA-8, 2006-Ohio-1859, ¶ 11, citing State v. Waddy, 63 Ohio St.3d 424, 441, 588 N.E.2d 819 (1992). Here, this issuance of the court order for records is governed by a standard less than probable cause due to the lack of a privacy interest in the requested records. 18 U.S.C.S. 2703(d). According to this statute, the standard for the issuing judge is whether 'the governmental entity offers specific and articulable facts showing that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the contents of a wire or electronic communication, or the records or other information sought, are relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation.' This standard is similar to that fleshed out in the Terry line of cases. United States v. Warshak, 631 F.3d 266, 291 (6th Cir.2010), citing Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968). Under this standard, an investigative search is reasonable when the state actor is able to point to articulable facts that give rise to a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. State v. Eddy, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. Assuming for the sake of argument that appellant has standing and an interest in the cell phone records, even with the omissions appellant points out, there still exists a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity based on the factual recitation above. The GPS search warrants and affidavits are not attached to any of appellant’s suppression motions filed with the clerk. However, an undocketed, unfiled copy of appellant’s May 18, 2016 suppression motion is included in the lower court file. This document has hand-written notations and other irregularities. Therefore, given these limitations, this court will examine appellant’s arguments in light of these warrants and affidavits. Attached to a May 7, 2015 GPS warrant is an affidavit executed by Det. Witalis. There, he describes the investigation of several individuals passing bad checks and the individuals supplying these checks. The information provided by D.H. was set forth, including the phone contact she had with a person named 'Ike' and the fact that he drove a white Oldsmobile Aurora. Det. Witalis averred that he was able to use phone records from the number provided by D.H. to hone in on a person closely associated with that phone number that also owned a white Oldsmobile Aurora. Detectives and a secret service agent then met with D.H. again and she picked appellant out of a photo array and identified him as Ike. Further surveillance of the address that Det. Witalis identified as being closely related to the cell phone number provided by D.H. resulted in Det. Witalis observing appellant driving the white Oldsmobile Aurora. This court’s review is further hampered by the nature of the record in this case because there are two documents purporting to be GPS warrants issued on May 7, 2015, for the same vehicle and appear to be copies of the same warrant. However, the affidavit attached to each is different. The second May 7, 2015 search warrant affidavit avers similar statements, but also included that an officer had taken a statement from J.M. She was caught attempting to pass a fraudulent check and indicated that it was supplied to her by someone who identified himself by the name of 'Black' and drove a white Oldsmobile Aurora. A June 24, 2015 warrant for an extension of the original GPS warrant indicated that appellant’s vehicle was at several banks when attempts were made to pass fraudulent checks. Det. Witalis also averred that the vehicle visited a check cashing business — the same check cashing business that employed Bohanon — prior to visiting the various financial institutions where fraudulent checks were passed. Regardless, at the suppression hearing, appellant argued in his opening statement that the GPS warrant affidavits were deficient, but then failed to pursue the issue further at the suppression hearing. All the evidence adduced was in relation to the court order issued by a municipal court judge for phone records, not the GPS warrants that were issued by a common pleas court judge. Appellant adduced testimony that detectives failed to disclose facts about D.H. — she had a history of mental illness including recent hospitalization, and she lied to police about her address — but that was in the context of the court order to obtain cell phone records. As this court recognized in Perry, it is the defendant’s burden to demonstrate a material misstatement or omission in a search warrant affidavit under Franks. Perry, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 97572, 2012-Ohio-4273, ¶ 15. Appellant failed to do so at the suppression hearing. Therefore, appellant’s first assignment of error is overruled.\"\n}\n```"}

In the course of arguing these issues, he also takes issue with the way in which the state obtained cell phone records. This court’s review of a decision on a motion to suppress is a mixed question of law and fact. The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution protects people from illegal searches and seizures. In order to employ Fourth Amendment protections, a defendant must have a 'constitutionally protected reasonable expectation of privacy.' Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 360, 88 S.Ct. 507, 19 L.Ed.2d 576 (1967). The United States Supreme Court has directed reviewing courts to consider a two-part test in order to determine whether the Fourth Amendment is implicated. 'First, has the individual manifested a subjective expectation of privacy in the object of the challenged search? Second, is society willing to recognize that expectation as reasonable?' California v. Ciraolo, 476 U.S. 207, 211, 106 S.Ct. 1809, 90 L.Ed.2d 210 (1986), citing Katz at 360. To the extent appellant challenges the decision related to the search warrants for the attachment of a GPS tracking device, this court cannot properly address those arguments. Appellant’s initial suppression motion references the warrants and accompanying affidavits, but those documents were not attached. At the suppression hearing, appellant did not introduce those documents as exhibits. As a result, those documents were not before the trial court at the appropriate time. We cannot discern the merit of appellant’s arguments without these documents. Statements made in a search warrant affidavit enjoy a presumption of validity. State v. Taylor, 174 Ohio App.3d 477, 2007-Ohio-7066, 882 N.E.2d 945 (1st Dist.). Without evidence to the contrary, this court is bound to find the statements made in the affidavit valid and, thus, the warrants valid. The evidence adduced at the suppression hearing indicated that police were investigating an incident where a person cashed fraudulent checks made to resemble payroll checks. Officers interviewed an individual, D.H., and she provided them with a phone number that she says was used to contact her in order to arrange the provision of a fraudulent check to her. She indicated the person with whom she communicated was named 'Ike,' and the two had exchanged text messages and talked over the phone. With her permission, officers examined her phone and viewed the text messages that were exchanged between that phone number and the person being interviewed. Det. Duffy then approached a municipal court judge for an order directing the cell phone provider to release records related to the account. Det. Duffy relayed the steps in the investigation that had occurred and the statements made by the individual under the investigation. Det. Duffy did not disclose that this individual had a history of mental illness and was recently hospitalized for mental health treatment, and did not disclose that this individual lied about her current address. The judge issued a court order directing AT&T to produce subscriber records relating to the phone number provided, including address, call logs, location data, and text messages. Det. Duffy and Det. Witalis received information regarding the phone number from AT&T, and the subscriber information was not helpful. The account information provided did not include a name, and the address listed was a California address. Det. Witalis described the phone as a 'burner' or anonymous phone. Using information contained in the call logs, Det. Witalis testified that he determined, through the frequency of the calls and other information, that the phone was likely related to an address on Monticello Boulevard in Richmond Heights, Ohio. A records check revealed a car registration for a white Oldsmobile Aurora owned by a person at that address. Upon surveillance of that address, he observed a car that matched the description provided by D.H., a white Oldsmobile Aurora. First, the trial court held that appellant did not have an expectation of privacy because he denied being the owner of the phone, the subscriber using the phone, or associated with the phone in any way. For a person to have been aggrieved by an unlawful search or seizure, he or she'must have been a victim of a search or seizure, one against whom the search was directed, as distinguished from one who claims prejudice only through the use of evidence gathered as a consequence of a search or seizure directed at someone else.' State v. Crawford, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 98605, 2013-Ohio-1659, ¶ 45, quoting Alderman v. United States, 394 U.S. 165, 173, 89 S.Ct. 961, 22 L.Ed.2d 176 (1969), quoting Jones v. United States, 362 U.S. 257, 261, 80 S.Ct. 725, 4 L.Ed.2d 697 (1960). This, alone, is a basis to affirm the trial court’s decision. Appellant has maintained that these records do not pertain to him. Therefore, he would not be aggrieved by a search of these records. However, because the state has asserted that these are records that relate to appellant in that they pertain to a cell phone used by appellant, in an abundance of caution, this court will analyze the matter further. This court has previously found no privacy right exists for cell phone records maintained by a phone company. Id. at ¶ 47 ('telephone users have no right of privacy in the numerical information they convey to the telephone company. Courts have also held that this reasoning applies to cell phone records obtained from cell phone companies as well.'), citing State v. Neely, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 24317, 2012-Ohio-212; United States v. Dye, N.D.Ohio No. 1:10CR221, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 47287 (Apr. 27, 2011). Information that has been voluntarily turned over to third parties does not enjoy protection because a person does not have a legitimate expectation of privacy in such information. The Second District has reaffirmed its holding in Neely and found that an individual has no constitutional privacy interest in cell phone location data, or ping data, maintained by a cell phone carrier. State v. Taylor, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 25764, 2014-Ohio-2550. The request for information sent to the phone company in that case requested location data, call logs, and subscriber information. Id. at ¶ 8. The court order in the present case also sought text messages. The request for text messages could lead to the disclosure of metadata about appellant’s communications as well as the content of communications where a privacy interest may exist. 18 U.S.C.S. 2703(c) specifically limits its application to records of electronic communications, but subsection (b) provides for the release of the contents of communications of a remote computing service only with prior notice to the subscriber and other restrictions. It is unclear from the suppression hearing whether any contents of text messages were, in fact, turned over and, if they were, whether they were used against appellant in any manner. If the requested information turned over by the phone company was limited to the date, time, and phone numbers of exchanged text messages, then appellant would not have a privacy interest in that metadata. Det. Duffy testified that he used the call logs of the anonymous cell phone to link that number to others that were frequently called. Through an investigation of those numbers, using searches of publicly available information, he was able to identify a residential address that was in some way associated with the person that used the anonymous phone. An Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles search yielded a vehicle matching the description given to police that was also associated with the address. There is no indication that the contents of the communications to which appellant had a reasonable expectation of privacy were turned over as a result of the court order or, if the contents of text messages were turned over, were used in the investigation against appellant as a result of the court order. Appellant has the burden of at least prima facie establishing a violation of his Fourth Amendment right to privacy, and without showing that the contents of text messages were, in fact, turned over to police, appellant has not made that showing. Appellant argues that the records disclosed to police were not turned over in discovery. This court cannot review such a claim, but it is apparent that appellant did not ask the detectives that testified at the suppression hearing whether the contents of text messages were disclosed. Further, the records were not otherwise used at trial. Therefore, the trial court did not err in this respect when denying appellant’s motion to suppress. Appellant also argues that there were material omissions made to the judge issuing the order that should have resulted in a lack of reasonable suspicion. Generally, when this court is reviewing this type of issue, there is a search warrant affidavit that details the information relayed to the authorizing judge. In this case, there is no affidavit relating to the court order used to obtain cell phone records, but Det. Duffy testified about the information relayed to the issuing judge. Det. Duffy readily admitted that he did not disclose that the witness had lied to him about her residence, and that he did not disclose that she was recently hospitalized for mental illness. Appellant likens this to cases where a search warrant affidavit contained material misstatements or omissions, allegedly causing them to be fatally deficient. See Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154, 98 S.Ct. 2674, 57 L.Ed.2d 667 (1978). In those cases, 'a defendant who claims that a warrant is flawed because it is based upon a false statement must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the affiant made a false statement, either intentionally, or with reckless disregard for the truth.' State v. Tinsley, 2d Dist. No. 23542, 2010 Ohio 3535, ¶ 23, citing Franks [v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154, 155-156, 98 S.Ct. 2674, 57 L.Ed.2d 667 (1978)]. State v. Perry, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 97572, 2012-Ohio-4273, ¶ 15. The Perry court went on to note that 'even if the affidavit contains false statements [or omissions] made intentionally or recklessly, a warrant based on the affidavit is still valid unless, with the affidavit’s false material set to one side [or with the omissions included], the affidavit’s remaining content is insufficient to establish probable cause.'

First, he claims: \\\"THE AFFIDAVIT ATTACHED TO THE SEARCH WARRANT FAILED TO PROVIDE PROBABLE CAUSE WHICH VIOLATES THE WARRANT CLAUSE OF U.S. CONSTITUTION, AMENDMENT IV.\\\" Appellant notes the detective relied on statements of a hotel manager and employees as to their observations; he did not personally observe the suspicious activity in the hotel parking lot. Appellant contends the detective's affidavit was ambiguous, \\\"bareboned,\\\" and facially lacking in a recital of probable cause. He concludes the detective's recitations in the affidavit were insufficient to support a belief there was drug trafficking occurring. He states this would have precluded the trial court from applying a good faith exception, which it did not in any event. In the affidavit, the detective said the general manager of the Comfort Inn advised the detective: a male registered for room 313 under Appellant's name that afternoon, presenting a Michigan driver's license; since that time there has been \\\"a lot of suspicious activity with cars pulling into the parking lot and this male going from car to car and people entering the hotel and leaving within a few minutes\\\"; and the manager watched this activity in plain view and on a video system with other hotel staff. From the information the detective received from the manager, he concluded \\\"it sounded like possible drug activity.\\\" The affidavit noted a criminal history check on Appellant showed a drug trafficking conviction and arrests for felonious assault and carrying a concealed weapon. The affidavit also referred to a subsequent call from a hotel employee who told the detective \\\"the traffic is picking up at the hotel\\\" and the general manager instructed her to call (after she called her manager to report the continued occurrences). Appellant's suppression motion, supplemental memorandum in support, and motion to reopen the suppression hearing did not specifically raise a claim that the affidavit was facially lacking in a recital of probable cause. Instead, the defense proceeded under the theory the warrant only contained probable cause because it suggested the male approaching cars was Appellant (and he argued this information should be excluded as false). Establishing probable cause is not as demanding as an adjudicatory hearing standard but requires \\\"more than a mere suspicion of guilt.\\\" See, e.g., In re A.J.S., 120 Ohio St.3d 185, 2008-Ohio-5307, 897 N.E.2d 629, ¶ 42, quoting State v. Iacona, 93 Ohio St.3d 83, 93, 752 N.E.2d 937 (2001). Underlying \\\"all the definitions\\\" of probable cause is \\\"a reasonable ground\\\" for belief; \\\"as the very name implies, we deal with probabilities.\\\" Brinegar v. United States, 338 U.S. 160, 174-175, 69 S.Ct. 1302, 93 L.Ed. 1879 (1949). Probable cause is a flexible, common-sense standard which does not demand any showing the belief is correct or more likely true than false. See also Texas v. Brown, 460 U.S. 730, 742, 103 S.Ct. 1535, 75 L.Ed.2d 502 (1983). See Iacona, 93 Ohio St.3d at 93 (it is a flexible concept grounded in fair probabilities which can be gleaned from considering the totality of the circumstances). Additionally, probable cause for a warrant can be based on evidence that would qualify as hearsay or would otherwise not be admissible if presented in a criminal trial. See United States v. Ventresca, 380 U.S. 102, 107-108, 85 S.Ct. 741, 13 L.Ed.2d 684 (1965). Counsel was not required to argue every possible suppression argument in order to render constitutionally ineffective assistance. Counsel had wide discretion to choose the issues to argue in support of suppression and the errors to be assigned on appeal. See Tenace, 109 Ohio St.3d 451 at ¶ 7, citing Jones v. Barnes, 463 U.S. 745, 751, 103 S.Ct. 3308, 77 L.Ed.2d 987 (1983). Attempting to address too many issues can result in a dilution of the force of the stronger arguments. Jones, 463 U.S. at 751-752 (\\\"Experienced advocates since time beyond memory have emphasized the importance of winnowing out weaker arguments on appeal\\\"). Counsel's judgments are entitled to strong deference as there is a wide range of reasonable professional assistance. State v. Smith, 95 Ohio St.3d 127, 2002-Ohio-1753, 766 N.E.2d 588, ¶ 8.

Mendoza, 137 Ohio App.3d 336, 738 N.E.2d 822 (3d Dist. 2000). Here, Rupert claims that the testimony of the victims was inconsistent and unreliable. The jury convicted Rupert of two counts of gross sexual imposition in violation of R.C. 2907.05, which provides in pertinent part as follows. (A) No person shall have sexual contact with another, not the spouse of the offender; cause another, not the spouse of the offender, to have sexual contact with the offender; or cause two or more other persons to have sexual contact when any of the following applies: * * * (4) The other person, or one of the other persons, is less than thirteen years of age, whether or not the offender knows the age of that person. There is no dispute in this case that the two victims were under the age of 13 at the time of the offenses. Thus, the only question is whether there was credible evidence that Rupert had sexual contact with the victims. Sexual contact is defined as ‘any touching of an erogenous zone of another, including without limitation the thigh, genitals, buttock, pubic region, or, if the person is a female, a breast, for the purpose of sexually arousing or gratifying either person.’ R.C. 2907.01(B). T.R., the victim of the actions making up Count 2, testified that on multiple occasions, Rupert would grab her hand and force her to touch her breasts, her vaginal area, or his ‘private area.’ Tr. 121. She also testified that Rupert would touch her vaginal area, breasts, and butt. Tr. 121. She indicated that most of the touching occurred over her clothing, but that there were two instances where he touched her vaginal area under her clothing. Tr. 128, 146-47. Rupert argues that this testimony is not credible because there were discrepancies in her testimony. The jury is the sole judge of the weight of the evidence and the credibility of witnesses. It may believe or disbelieve any witness or accept part of what a witness says and reject the rest. In reaching its verdict, the jury should consider the demeanor of the witness and the manner in which he testifies, his connection or relationship with the prosecution or the defendant, and his interest, if any, in the outcome. State v. Antill, 176 Ohio St. 61, 67, 197 N.E.2d 548 (1964). ‘The choice between credible witnesses and their conflicting testimony rests solely with the finder of fact and an appellate court may not substitute its own judgment for that of the finder of fact.’ State v. Kruse, 3d Dist. Union No. 14-16-15, 2017-Ohio-5667, ¶ 66 quoting State v. Awan, 22 Ohio St.3d 120, 123, 489 N.E.2d 277 (1986). Here, the alleged inconsistencies were before the jury and it had the opportunity to weigh the evidence presented. The jury clearly took its task seriously as it found Rupert not guilty of Counts 3 and 4 which were also based upon T.R.’s testimony. E.B., who was the victim of the actions in Count 1, testified that she was lying on the bed in Rupert’s bedroom watching tv when he came in and laid on the bed behind her. Tr. 168-69. E.B. then testified that Rupert reached his arm over her and started touching her vagina inside her pants, but on the outside of her underwear. Tr. 169-70. According to E.B., Rupert was rubbing the outside of her vaginal area, but did not go inside of her. Tr. 171. Rupert argues this testimony lacks credibility because on redirect, she indicated that his finger went in. However, as discussed above, the jury was given the opportunity to hear all of the evidence, including the inconsistencies and determine what was credible. The jury was not required to believe all of the testimony. The jury evidently chose to believe the testimony given on direct because it found Rupert not guilty of rape, but guilty of the lesser included offense of gross sexual imposition. The jury also found him not guilty of sexual battery as it related to E.B. Viewing all the evidence as a whole, we cannot say that the evidence weighs heavily against conviction or that the jury clearly lost its way and created a manifest miscarriage of justice. The first assignment of error is overruled.\"\n}\n```"}

{"Index": "466-Hayes", "allegation_num": "allegation_1", "allegation": "Hayes argues that his conviction was against the manifest weight of the evidence.", "discussion": "```json\n{\n  \"discussion\": \"In his first assignment of error, Hayes argues that his conviction was against the manifest weight of the evidence. He contends that the jury lost its way when it reconciled the conflicting evidence in favor of the state. In reviewing a challenge to the weight of the evidence, we sit as a 'thirteenth juror.' State v. Thompkins, 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 387, 678 N.E.2d 541 (1997). We must review the entire record, weigh the evidence, consider the credibility of the witnesses, and determine whether the trier of fact clearly lost its way and created a manifest miscarriage of justice. Id. Hayes argues that Kelley's and Johnson's testimony was not credible, that Chandler's investigation did not properly test their reliability, and that the evidence relating to the white SUV was inconclusive. A. Kelley's Credibility Hayes argues that Kelley's prior use of the court system against Hayes diluted her credibility. Defense counsel thoroughly cross-examined Kelley about her history of court filings and charges against Hayes, so that the jury was able to use that information in determining her credibility. And in closing argument, defense counsel walked through the timing of each of Kelley's filings against Hayes and argued that Kelley 'knows how to weaponize the Court system to try to get what she wants.' He also argued, 'We've gotten the legal past of Ms. Kelley: the filing, after filing, after filing, after filing that she has done to try and get a conviction on Mr. Hayes.' Therefore, the jury was able to weigh Kelley's credibility in light of her previous use of the court system. Next, Hayes points out that Kelley was admonished numerous times by the trial court to confine her testimony to the questions asked and to stop inserting gratuitous commentary. However, Hayes did not assign as error the trial court's failure to control Kelley as a witness. Nonetheless, the court's admonitions to Kelley were made in the jury's presence, so the jury could weigh them in assessing Kelley's testimony. Hayes also argues that there was an unexplained 36-minute lapse between the time that a neighbor knocked on Kelley's door at 7:00 a.m., and Kelley's 911 call at 7:36 a.m. Kelley testified that the neighbor knocked at 'about' 7:00 a.m., and Johnson was asked to tell the jury what happened 'around' 7:00 a.m. Defense counsel argued this discrepancy in closing, so the jury was able to consider the evidence as to the timing of the call in relationship to the report of fire. In addition, Hayes argues that there were inconsistencies between Kelley’s statements to the 911 operator and Kelley’s testimony at trial as to whether Hayes walked or ran from the burning car, as to Kelley’s identification of Hayes by his tall, bowlegged frame despite not having seen his face, and Kelley’s not having told the 911 operator that Hayes had gotten into a white SUV. Defense counsel explored these inconsistencies during cross-examination and argued them in closing, so the jury was able to weigh them in considering Kelley’s credibility. B. Johnson’s Credibility Hayes argues that Johnson was not credible because he initially denied being at the scene of the burned car despite photos from Officer Cameron’s body-worn camera showing that Johnson was there. The jury heard defense counsel’s cross-examination of Johnson on the issue and defense counsel argued this inconsistency in closing: 'Then why is [Johnson] on the body cams standing right next to [Kelley]?' The jury, therefore, was able to weigh these inconsistencies when evaluating Johnson’s credibility. Hayes further argues that Johnson’s claim that he and Kelley did not discuss the case was belied by cell-phone records indicating that they had spoken 38 times in the days following the fire. However, those records were not admitted into evidence, and both Kelley and Johnson denied that contact. When asked if she had 38 contacts with Johnson between December 25 and January 4, Kelley said, 'I don’t know if I did or didn’t. * * * I don’t see how I would call him that many times.' Defense counsel asked Johnson, 'You said when your dog gets out * * * is when you contact Ms. Kelley. So between December 25th and January the 4th, did your dog get out 38 times?' Johnson replied, 'Hell no.' Counsel asked, 'So these records are wrong too?,' and Johnson replied, 'If I called her, it’s wrong. It might be butt dialed, but not no 38 times.' In closing, defense counsel argued, 'once they realized I had phone records, there had to be some explanation. And Mr. Johnson had that locked and loaded by the time he got to the stand.' Accordingly, the jury was able to weigh Johnson’s testimony about his contacts with Kelley. C. The Investigation Hayes argues that Chandler’s investigation unfairly targeted him from the start. He points to Chandler’s failure to obtain written statements from Kelley or Johnson and his failure to obtain Kelley’s cell phone records when she refused to hand over her phone. However, defense counsel explored these matters on cross-examination and argued them in closing, so the jury could assess the weight to be given to Chandler’s testimony. D. The White SUV Hayes argues that, at most, the LPR evidence established that a white SUV registered to Moore was tracked somewhere in the vicinity of Kelley’s apartment within 15 hours of the fire. Defense counsel cross-examined Whitton about the evidence and argued in closing: 'This white SUV that was seen somewhere in the vicinity, 15 hours later, at night, on the road that is not in question, with a driver that we cannot see and had no idea if there’s a passenger,' and 'This is the best they have to try to put Mr. Hayes in the area some 15-and-a-half hours later in a car that is not his in a location that is irrelevant to this case.' The jury heard the evidence and defense counsel’s cross-examination of Whitton and closing argument, and was able to assess what weight to give the evidence. E.

He contends that the jury lost its way when it reconciled the conflicting evidence in favor of the state. In reviewing a challenge to the weight of the evidence, we sit as a 'thirteenth juror.' State v. Thompkins, 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 387, 678 N.E.2d 541 (1997). We must review the entire record, weigh the evidence, consider the credibility of the witnesses, and determine whether the trier of fact clearly lost its way and created a manifest miscarriage of justice. Id. Hayes argues that Kelley's and Johnson's testimony was not credible, that Chandler's investigation did not properly test their reliability, and that the evidence relating to the white SUV was inconclusive. A. Kelley's Credibility Hayes argues that Kelley's prior use of the court system against Hayes diluted her credibility. Defense counsel thoroughly cross-examined Kelley about her history of court filings and charges against Hayes, so that the jury was able to use that information in determining her credibility. And in closing argument, defense counsel walked through the timing of each of Kelley's filings against Hayes and argued that Kelley 'knows how to weaponize the Court system to try to get what she wants.' He also argued, 'We've gotten the legal past of Ms. Kelley: the filing, after filing, after filing, after filing that she has done to try and get a conviction on Mr. Hayes.' Therefore, the jury was able to weigh Kelley's credibility in light of her previous use of the court system. Next, Hayes points out that Kelley was admonished numerous times by the trial court to confine her testimony to the questions asked and to stop inserting gratuitous commentary. However, Hayes did not assign as error the trial court's failure to control Kelley as a witness. Nonetheless, the court's admonitions to Kelley were made in the jury's presence, so the jury could weigh them in assessing Kelley's testimony. Hayes also argues that there was an unexplained 36-minute lapse between the time that a neighbor knocked on Kelley's door at 7:00 a.m., and Kelley's 911 call at 7:36 a.m. Kelley testified that the neighbor knocked at 'about' 7:00 a.m., and Johnson was asked to tell the jury what happened 'around' 7:00 a.m. Defense counsel argued this discrepancy in closing, so the jury was able to consider the evidence as to the timing of the call in relationship to the report of fire. In addition, Hayes argues that there were inconsistencies between Kelley’s statements to the 911 operator and Kelley’s testimony at trial as to whether Hayes walked or ran from the burning car, as to Kelley’s identification of Hayes by his tall, bowlegged frame despite not having seen his face, and Kelley’s not having told the 911 operator that Hayes had gotten into a white SUV. Defense counsel explored these inconsistencies during cross-examination and argued them in closing, so the jury was able to weigh them in considering Kelley’s credibility. B. Johnson’s Credibility Hayes argues that Johnson was not credible because he initially denied being at the scene of the burned car despite photos from Officer Cameron’s body-worn camera showing that Johnson was there. The jury heard defense counsel’s cross-examination of Johnson on the issue and defense counsel argued this inconsistency in closing: 'Then why is [Johnson] on the body cams standing right next to [Kelley]?' The jury, therefore, was able to weigh these inconsistencies when evaluating Johnson’s credibility. Hayes further argues that Johnson’s claim that he and Kelley did not discuss the case was belied by cell-phone records indicating that they had spoken 38 times in the days following the fire. However, those records were not admitted into evidence, and both Kelley and Johnson denied that contact. When asked if she had 38 contacts with Johnson between December 25 and January 4, Kelley said, 'I don’t know if I did or didn’t. * * * I don’t see how I would call him that many times.' Defense counsel asked Johnson, 'You said when your dog gets out * * * is when you contact Ms. Kelley. So between December 25th and January the 4th, did your dog get out 38 times?' Johnson replied, 'Hell no.' Counsel asked, 'So these records are wrong too?,' and Johnson replied, 'If I called her, it’s wrong. It might be butt dialed, but not no 38 times.' In closing, defense counsel argued, 'once they realized I had phone records, there had to be some explanation. And Mr. Johnson had that locked and loaded by the time he got to the stand.' Accordingly, the jury was able to weigh Johnson’s testimony about his contacts with Kelley. C. The Investigation Hayes argues that Chandler’s investigation unfairly targeted him from the start. He points to Chandler’s failure to obtain written statements from Kelley or Johnson and his failure to obtain Kelley’s cell phone records when she refused to hand over her phone. However, defense counsel explored these matters on cross-examination and argued them in closing, so the jury could assess the weight to be given to Chandler’s testimony. D. The White SUV Hayes argues that, at most, the LPR evidence established that a white SUV registered to Moore was tracked somewhere in the vicinity of Kelley’s apartment within 15 hours of the fire. Defense counsel cross-examined Whitton about the evidence and argued in closing: 'This white SUV that was seen somewhere in the vicinity, 15 hours later, at night, on the road that is not in question, with a driver that we cannot see and had no idea if there’s a passenger,' and 'This is the best they have to try to put Mr. Hayes in the area some 15-and-a-half hours later in a car that is not his in a location that is irrelevant to this case.' The jury heard the evidence and defense counsel’s cross-examination of Whitton and closing argument, and was able to assess what weight to give the evidence. E. Conclusion as to Manifest Weight Overall, the jury was in the best position to judge the credibility of the witnesses. See State v.

The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution forbids prosecutors from exercising peremptory challenges in a racially discriminatory manner. The Batson v. Kentucky case set forth a procedure for evaluating claims of racial discrimination in the use of peremptory strikes at criminal trials. The trial court committed clear error by allowing the strike, and we must reverse Saunders’s convictions and remand for a new trial. The dispute in this case involves prospective juror number 5, who is black. During voir dire, she indicated that her brother and brother-in-law had been convicted of murder and had turned their lives around after their release from prison. The prosecutor exercised peremptory challenges against two potential jurors, including Juror 5, and later stated that Juror 5's family situations prompted the strike. The prosecutor's reasoning involved the shared-race concern condemned in Batson. The trial court responded 'okay' without further inquiry and ultimately allowed the strike, even though Saunders established that the prosecutor's challenge was'motivated in substantial part by discriminatory intent.' The trial court's acceptance of the state's explanation and its denial of Saunders's equal-protection claim was clearly erroneous. Consequently, we sustain Saunders’s second assignment of error, reverse the trial court’s judgment, and remand this cause for a new trial.\"\n}\n```"}

The record reveals that defense counsel reserved his opening statement until the close of the state's case-in-chief. The prosecutor objected as follows during defense counsel's opening statement: [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: The State's going to suggest to you that you heard a full confession from Mr. Combs and that you have a full written confession. What you have is a recorded statement from Mr. Combs and a written statement from Mr. Combs. And in that statement, he gives a lot of information. The officers commended him on how truthful and how honest and how helpful he was. [PROSECUTOR]: I'm going to object.

Appellant contends the prosecutor's single objection during defense counsel's opening statement damaged his right to a fair trial. He argues that by interrupting defense counsel's opening remarks, the prosecutor 'tainted the jury' by'sending a signal to the jury that [defense counsel] d[id] not deserve to be listened to. This is bad behavior and an example of a prosecutor using dirty tricks to achieve his point.' 'For a conviction to be reversed because of prosecutorial misconduct, a defendant must prove the prosecutor's acts were improper and that they prejudicially affected the defendant's substantial rights.'

Butler No. CA2011-09-176, 2012-Ohio-4769, ¶ 57. Prosecutorial misconduct 'is not grounds for error unless the defendant has been denied a fair trial.' State v. Olvera-Guillen, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2007-05-118, 2008-Ohio-5416, ¶ 27. 'The accused is to be given a fair trial, not a perfect trial.' State v. Kaaz, 12th Dist. Clinton No. CA2016-05-010, 2017-Ohio-5669, ¶ 102, citing Michigan v. Tucker, 417 U.S. 433, 94 S.Ct. 2357 (1974). See also State v. Landrum, 53 Ohio St.3d 107, 112 (1990) (noting that a defendant is not guaranteed an 'error free, perfect trial'). In the present case, appellant cannot establish that the prosecutor's objection was improper or that it prejudicially affected his substantial rights. 'Although it is considered quite rude to repeatedly object during another party's opening or closing, there is no rule prohibiting counsel from interrupting a party's arguments with valid objections.' State v. Mulvey, 7th Dist. Belmont No. 08 BE 31, 2009-Ohio-6756, ¶ 44. Here, although the trial court overruled the prosecutor's objection, there was a valid basis for the objection. The prosecutor objected as he believed defense counsel was attempting to use a police officer's statements to vouch for appellant's credibility. Not only are officers not permitted to render opinions on an accused's truthfulness; see State v. Carpenter, 12th Dist. Clermont No. CA2012-06-041, 2013-Ohio-1385, ¶ 18-20; but in this case, shortly before defense counsel gave his opening statement, the trial court admonished the jury as follows regarding an officer's ability to vouch for appellant's truthfulness: THE COURT: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, both counsel asked questions of Capt. Hampton in terms of his belief in terms of whether or not Mr. Combs was being truthful. I probably should have then objected and not permitted anybody to inquire about that. The issue in terms of credibility is for you to decide, and a witness is not allowed to testify as to their opinion as to whether or not they believe a person was being truthful or untruthful. You can certainly consider everything that was testified to, the defendant's statement in relation to the evidence that has been offered. But you are instructed to disregard the testimony that was given, both in response to [defense counsel's] questioning, as well as [the prosecutor's] questioning, in terms of whether or not Capt. Hampton believed that Mr. Combs was being truthful. Okay? That's a decision ultimately that you're going to make. Accordingly, the prosecutor's objection was not improper and had a valid basis. Additionally, the prosecutor's single objection did not result in any prejudice to appellant. The objection, which consisted of the prosecutor saying, 'I'm going to object' and then a sidebar discussion, did not prejudice the jury or have an impact on the outcome of the trial. The jury continued to give their attention to defense counsel, and at the close of trial, rendered an acquittal on two of the three charges appellant faced. Appellant cannot demonstrate any prejudice and his claim of prosecutorial misconduct, therefore, fails. Appellant also argues he received ineffective representation from defense counsel as counsel failed to move for a mistrial following the interruption of defense counsel's opening statement. 'In order to prevail on an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim, a defendant must prove that counsel's performance was deficient and that the defendant was prejudiced by counsel's deficient performance.' State v. Davis, 159 Ohio St.3d 31, 2020-Ohio-309, ¶ 10, citing State v. Bradley, 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 141-142 (1989) and Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052 (1984). 'Thus, the defendant must demonstrate that counsel's performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and that there exists a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's error, the result of the proceeding would have been different.' Id., citing Bradley at paragraphs two and three of the syllabus. In the present case, appellant cannot demonstrate that counsel was deficient for not moving for a mistrial or that he was prejudiced by this decision. '[W]hether or not to move for a mistrial is a tactical decision and is well within the range of competent assistance of counsel.' State v. Gilbert, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2010-09-240, 2011-Ohio-4340, ¶ 83. Appellant was not prejudiced by counsel's decision not to move for a mistrial, as such a motion would have been futile. Mistrials are only declared 'when the ends of justice so require and a fair trial is no longer possible.' State v. Garner, 74 Ohio St.3d 49, 59 (1995). As discussed above, the prosecutor's sole objection during defense counsel's opening statement did not prevent appellant from receiving a fair trial and it did not affect the outcome of trial. Appellant's ineffective assistance of counsel claim is, therefore, without merit.\"\n}\n```"}

Butler No. CA2007-05-118, 2008-Ohio-5416, ¶ 27. 'The accused is to be given a fair trial, not a perfect trial.' State v. Kaaz, 12th Dist. Clinton No. CA2016-05-010, 2017-Ohio-5669, ¶ 102, citing Michigan v. Tucker, 417 U.S. 433, 94 S.Ct. 2357 (1974). See also State v. Landrum, 53 Ohio St.3d 107, 112 (1990) (noting that a defendant is not guaranteed an 'error free, perfect trial'). In the present case, appellant cannot establish that the prosecutor's objection was improper or that it prejudicially affected his substantial rights. 'Although it is considered quite rude to repeatedly object during another party's opening or closing, there is no rule prohibiting counsel from interrupting a party's arguments with valid objections.' State v. Mulvey, 7th Dist. Belmont No. 08 BE 31, 2009-Ohio-6756, ¶ 44. Here, although the trial court overruled the prosecutor's objection, there was a valid basis for the objection. The prosecutor objected as he believed defense counsel was attempting to use a police officer's statements to vouch for appellant's credibility. Not only are officers not permitted to render opinions on an accused's truthfulness; see State v. Carpenter, 12th Dist. Clermont No. CA2012-06-041, 2013-Ohio-1385, ¶ 18-20; but in this case, shortly before defense counsel gave his opening statement, the trial court admonished the jury as follows regarding an officer's ability to vouch for appellant's truthfulness: THE COURT: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, both counsel asked questions of Capt. Hampton in terms of his belief in terms of whether or not Mr. Combs was being truthful. I probably should have then objected and not permitted anybody to inquire about that. The issue in terms of credibility is for you to decide, and a witness is not allowed to testify as to their opinion as to whether or not they believe a person was being truthful or untruthful. You can certainly consider everything that was testified to, the defendant's statement in relation to the evidence that has been offered. But you are instructed to disregard the testimony that was given, both in response to [defense counsel's] questioning, as well as [the prosecutor's] questioning, in terms of whether or not Capt. Hampton believed that Mr. Combs was being truthful. Okay? That's a decision ultimately that you're going to make. Accordingly, the prosecutor's objection was not improper and had a valid basis. Additionally, the prosecutor's single objection did not result in any prejudice to appellant. The objection, which consisted of the prosecutor saying, 'I'm going to object' and then a sidebar discussion, did not prejudice the jury or have an impact on the outcome of the trial. The jury continued to give their attention to defense counsel, and at the close of trial, rendered an acquittal on two of the three charges appellant faced. Appellant cannot demonstrate any prejudice and his claim of prosecutorial misconduct, therefore, fails. Appellant also argues he received ineffective representation from defense counsel as counsel failed to move for a mistrial following the interruption of defense counsel's opening statement. 'In order to prevail on an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim, a defendant must prove that counsel's performance was deficient and that the defendant was prejudiced by counsel's deficient performance.' State v. Davis, 159 Ohio St.3d 31, 2020-Ohio-309, ¶ 10, citing State v. Bradley, 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 141-142 (1989) and Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052 (1984). 'Thus, the defendant must demonstrate that counsel's performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and that there exists a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's error, the result of the proceeding would have been different.' Id., citing Bradley at paragraphs two and three of the syllabus. In the present case, appellant cannot demonstrate that counsel was deficient for not moving for a mistrial or that he was prejudiced by this decision. '[W]hether or not to move for a mistrial is a tactical decision and is well within the range of competent assistance of counsel.' State v. Gilbert, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2010-09-240, 2011-Ohio-4340, ¶ 83. Appellant was not prejudiced by counsel's decision not to move for a mistrial, as such a motion would have been futile. Mistrials are only declared 'when the ends of justice so require and a fair trial is no longer possible.' State v. Garner, 74 Ohio St.3d 49, 59 (1995). As discussed above, the prosecutor's sole objection during defense counsel's opening statement did not prevent appellant from receiving a fair trial and it did not affect the outcome of trial. Appellant's ineffective assistance of counsel claim is, therefore, without merit.\"\n}\n```"}

However, because the testimony was elicited on cross-examination to impeach Hamm (and not the accused—McDuffie) as to her credibility for truthfulness or untruthfulness, the evidence falls within the scope of Evid.R. 404(A)(3), 607, 611, 608(B) and not 404(B). See Evid.R. 404(A)(3), 607, 611, and 608(B). See also Evid.R. 616(A), (B). (Oct. 9, 2019 Tr. at 118-119, 121-123). Evid.R. 607 states in pertinent part: The credibility of a witness may be attacked by any party except that the credibility of a witness may be attacked by the party calling the witness by means of a prior inconsistent statement only upon a showing of surprise and affirmative damage. This exception does not apply to statements admitted pursuant to Evid.R. 801(D)(1)(A), 801(D)(2), or 803. Evid.R. 607(A). 'Cross-examination shall be permitted on all relevant matters and matters affecting credibility.' State v. Potts, 3d Dist. Hancock No. 5-16-03, 2016-Ohio-5555, ¶ 73, quoting Evid.R. 611(B). Under Evid.R. 608, the credibility of a witness may be attacked through opinion, reputation, and specific instances of conduct evidence as to the character of the witness for truthfulness or untruthfulness. See Evid.R. 608. Moreover, and relevant to the facts presented, under Evid.R. 616, a witness may be impeached as to bias (motive to misrepresent), sensory or mental defect (inability to remember the events), and specific contradictions within certain limitations. See Evid.R. 616 (A)-(C). Here, the State attacked the credibility of Hamm on cross-examination under Evid.R. 608 and 616. (See Oct. 9, 2019 Tr. at 118-119, 121-123). Notwithstanding the permissibility of such an attack on a witness’ credibility under Evid.R. 608(B), Evid.R. 403(A) would mandate exclusion of this type of relevant-character evidence 'if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, of confusion of the issues, or of misleading the jury.' However, and important to this discussion, Hamm testified that the large quantity of crack cocaine (24.12 grams) seized was for her exclusive-personal use and that McDuffie was not aware that she used crack cocaine or that the crack cocaine was located in their bedroom. (See Oct. 9, 2019 Tr. at 87-88, 101, 110). Here, the State’s line of questioning (of Hamm) attacked Hamm’s credibility, since such evidence indicated that McDuffie was aware that Hamm possessed the drugs, and that such drugs were not for Hamm’s exclusive-personal use. (See id.). As a consequence, the jury was free to conclude that since Hamm was not credible (because she was untruthful as to McDuffie’s knowledge of her drug use and the purpose of her possession) perhaps the remainder of her testimony lacked any indicia of truthfulness. See State v. Schwegmann, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-180053, 2018-Ohio-3757, ¶ 11, citing State v. Hussein, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-020155, 2003-Ohio-1369, ¶ 8, citing State v. Boggs, 63 Ohio St.3d 418, 421 (1992). Because McDuffie does not challenge whether Hamm’s testimony is relevant or admissible as such, we will not address the applicability of Evid.R. 401 and 402. Moreover, Hamm was subject to impeachment by the State as to bias (i.e., her motive to misrepresent the ownership of the drugs as well as McDuffie’s knowledge of the drugs because of their relationship) and to a sensory or mental defect (for her inability to remember certain text messages with McDuffie despite being able to recall other unrelated text messages). (See Oct. 9, 2019 Tr. at 97-98, 132, 133, 138, 141). See Hussein at ¶ 8-9. Her testimony is not merely contradictory testimony on collateral issues, but rather, material to the issue presently before the trial court regarding the truthfulness of this witness. See Boggs at 422. Nevertheless, the trial court admonished the parties to proceed carefully because of its duty to consider mandatory exclusion under Evid.R. 403(A) stating: [Trial Court] Again, that being said, I want to caution the parties that I’m going to continue to weigh the probative value as compared to the prejudicial effect of any evidence that might sought to be elicited. The mere fact that I’m saying that this witness can be cross-examined does not mean that everything is now fair game. And I think the Prosecutors know what I’m saying. Are [sic] well aware of the fact that the Defendant in this case is not charged with Trafficking, that I’m not, by saying that this witness can be cross-examined in order to examine potential inconsistencies or untruthfulness that there may be in her testimony for the purposes of impeaching her. That does not mean that I’m saying that the State would now have carte blanche to go into other things that may be indicative of trafficking of drugs on the part of the Defendant. We’re not going to go there. Let me [sic] abundantly clear about that. So anything further that we need to address while out of the presence of the jury? (Oct. 9, 2019 Tr. at 121-122). Notably, McDuffie never objected on the basis that exclusion was mandatory or discretionary under Evid.R. 403. Thus, upon our review of the record, we cannot conclude that there is an obvious defect in this trial that affected McDuffie’s substantial rights. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and even if we were to have concluded otherwise, McDuffie cannot demonstrate prejudice since Hamm was not able to recall the content of any of the text messages despite the attempts made by the State to refresh her recollection. (Id. at 132-133). See Evid.R. 612. Accordingly, McDuffie’s argument is without merit. Moreover, we cannot conclude that there is any error and certainly not error that rises to the level of plain error in relation to Hamm’s impeachment by the State, which has caused a manifest miscarriage of justice warranting a new trial. Therefore, McDuffie’s first assignment of error is overruled.\"\n}\n```"}

Here, the State’s line of questioning (of Hamm) attacked Hamm’s credibility, since such evidence indicated that McDuffie was aware that Hamm possessed the drugs, and that such drugs were not for Hamm’s exclusive-personal use. (See id.). As a consequence, the jury was free to conclude that since Hamm was not credible (because she was untruthful as to McDuffie’s knowledge of her drug use and the purpose of her possession) perhaps the remainder of her testimony lacked any indicia of truthfulness. See State v. Schwegmann, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-180053, 2018-Ohio-3757, ¶ 11, citing State v. Hussein, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-020155, 2003-Ohio-1369, ¶ 8, citing State v. Boggs, 63 Ohio St.3d 418, 421 (1992). Because McDuffie does not challenge whether Hamm’s testimony is relevant or admissible as such, we will not address the applicability of Evid.R. 401 and 402. Moreover, Hamm was subject to impeachment by the State as to bias (i.e., her motive to misrepresent the ownership of the drugs as well as McDuffie’s knowledge of the drugs because of their relationship) and to a sensory or mental defect (for her inability to remember certain text messages with McDuffie despite being able to recall other unrelated text messages). (See Oct. 9, 2019 Tr. at 97-98, 132, 133, 138, 141). See Hussein at ¶ 8-9. Her testimony is not merely contradictory testimony on collateral issues, but rather, material to the issue presently before the trial court regarding the truthfulness of this witness. See Boggs at 422. Nevertheless, the trial court admonished the parties to proceed carefully because of its duty to consider mandatory exclusion under Evid.R. 403(A) stating: [Trial Court] Again, that being said, I want to caution the parties that I’m going to continue to weigh the probative value as compared to the prejudicial effect of any evidence that might sought to be elicited. The mere fact that I’m saying that this witness can be cross-examined does not mean that everything is now fair game. And I think the Prosecutors know what I’m saying. Are [sic] well aware of the fact that the Defendant in this case is not charged with Trafficking, that I’m not, by saying that this witness can be cross-examined in order to examine potential inconsistencies or untruthfulness that there may be in her testimony for the purposes of impeaching her. That does not mean that I’m saying that the State would now have carte blanche to go into other things that may be indicative of trafficking of drugs on the part of the Defendant. We’re not going to go there. Let me [sic] abundantly clear about that. So anything further that we need to address while out of the presence of the jury? (Oct. 9, 2019 Tr. at 121-122). Notably, McDuffie never objected on the basis that exclusion was mandatory or discretionary under Evid.R. 403. Thus, upon our review of the record, we cannot conclude that there is an obvious defect in this trial that affected McDuffie’s substantial rights. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and even if we were to have concluded otherwise, McDuffie cannot demonstrate prejudice since Hamm was not able to recall the content of any of the text messages despite the attempts made by the State to refresh her recollection. (Id. at 132-133). See Evid.R. 612. Accordingly, McDuffie’s argument is without merit. Moreover, we cannot conclude that there is any error and certainly not error that rises to the level of plain error in relation to Hamm’s impeachment by the State, which has caused a manifest miscarriage of justice warranting a new trial. Therefore, McDuffie’s first assignment of error is overruled.\"\n}\n```"}
