273-Green,1,Yes.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
Under 28 U.S.C. § 2244(d), the statute of limitations begins to run when a conviction is final on direct review unless a later date is shown. In this case that date is August 30, 2013, the date on which his time to file an appeal of right expired. With that as the finality date, the “trigger
date” for § 2244(d) purposes, the statute would have expired September 1, 2014, as to Grounds One and Two.

275-Alvarado,1,Yes.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
Respondent argues Alvarado’s claim that the prosecutor suppressed material, exculpatory evidence as identified in Charles Wells’ affidavit is procedurally defaulted as the state courts found Alvarado’s filings for post-conviction for relief untimely, which is an adequate and independent state ground to foreclose habeas review. (Doc. No. 88 at 31.) Respondent further argues Alvarado fails to demonstrate cause and prejudice to excuse the procedural default, and fails to present any new, reliable evidence to excuse the default. (Id. at 33-34.)

287-Mack,0,Yes,"Context information is below.
---------------------
As Respondent asserts, these claims are procedurally defaulted. They arise out of the record of proceedings in the trial court, and therefore could have been raised on direct appeal. But Mack failed to do so, and under Ohio law, res judicata now prohibits him from raising the issues in any post-conviction proceeding. See Wong v. Money, 142 F.3d 313, 322 (6th Cir. 1998) (“Under Ohio law, the failure to raise on appeal a claim that appears on the face of the record constitutes a procedural default under the State’s doctrine of res judicata.”); State v. Perry, 10 Ohio St. 2d 175 (Ohio 1967) (holding that res judicata bars a criminal defendant from raising in post-conviction proceedings those claims that could have been raised at trial or on direct appeal). With no state-court remedies still available to him, Mack has defaulted the claims. See Gray v. Netherland, 518 U.S. 152, 161–62 (1996) (“Because the exhaustion requirement refers only to remedies still available at the time of the federal petition . . ., it is satisfied if it is clear that [the petitioner’s] claims are now
procedurally barred under [state] law.”) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted); *Alley v. Bell*, 307 F.3d 380, 385 (6th Cir. 2002) (“[I]f an unexhausted claim would be procedurally barred under state law, that claim is procedurally defaulted for purposes of federal habeas review.”).

289-Redic,1,Yes,"Context information is below.
---------------------
Ohio law allows a litigant forty-five days to appeal to the Supreme Court of Ohio from an adverse decision of the court of appeals. In this case Redic’s time to appeal expired October 23, 2019, but he did not file a notice of appeal until February 20, 2020, along with a motion for delayed appeal (State Court Record, ECF No. 4, Exs. 21, 22). The Supreme Court summarily denied the motion. Id. at Ex. 23.

---------------------
The state filed a response in opposition. ECF Doc. 12-1 at 341-49. On July 26, 2016, the trial court denied Rock’s petition as untimely because the transcript was filed in the Ohio Court of Appeals on June 8, 2015, making the deadline for filing a petition for postconviction relief June 7, 2016. ECF Doc. 12-1 at 350. Alternatively, the court found that the claims Rock raised therein would be barred by res judicata. Id.
