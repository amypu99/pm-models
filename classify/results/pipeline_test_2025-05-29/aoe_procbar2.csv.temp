As before, Montgomery did not raise these issues on direct appeal. They are procedurally defaulted. Even if these issues were not procedurally defaulted, Defendant’s first two examples are instances where the Court made an extra effort to ensure Defendant’s due process and confrontation rights, not violate them.
---------------------
Given the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.
Query: Does the text above indicate that the assignments of error were procedurally barred because the appellant failed to properly file for appeal? Answer with only a 'Yes' or 'No'.  If you cannot determine the answer, provide your best yes or no guess.
