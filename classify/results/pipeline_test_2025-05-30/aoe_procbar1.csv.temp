205-Zimpfer,0,Yes,"Context information is below.
---------------------
In 2014, Zimpfer was convicted of three counts of unlawful sexual conduct with a minor and four counts of rape (by force or threat of force). He was sentenced to a prison term of 33 years and designated a Tier III sex offender/child victim offender. Following an appeal, we affirmed the conviction and sentence. State v. Zimpfer, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 26062, 2014-Ohio-4401. While his direct appeal was pending, Zimpfer filed a petition for post-conviction relief which the trial court denied. We affirmed the trial court’s denial in State v. Zimpfer, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 26857, 2016-Ohio-7330. Zimpfer filed two separate applications seeking to reopen both appeals. This court denied both applications. Zimpfer also filed in the trial court a motion for production of documents seeking to have the Montgomery County Clerk of Courts provide him with a copy of all documents related to his case. The motion was denied by the trial court and Zimpfer appealed. We dismissed his appeal as untimely. The Ohio Supreme Court did not allow an appeal of our dismissal. State v. Zimpfer, 152 Ohio St.3d 1411, 2018-Ohio-723, 92 N.E.3d 881 (Table).

---------------------
¶ 3 On May 7, 2019, Reid filed a petition to vacate or set aside his conviction based on newly discovered evidence that was outside the record. He requested an evidentiary hearing. Reid argued that the Dayton Police Department (“DPD”) had misrepresented its records retention policy and that the State had failed to turn over 911 recordings related to the shooting, in violation of his due process rights and Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1953). The trial court dismissed the petition based upon the doctrine of res judicata, finding that “the matter of the missing
911 call(s) has been litigated previously in post-conviction proceedings.” Reid appealed, and this Court dismissed his appeal for failure to timely file a notice of appeal. State v. Reid, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 28477 (Decision & Final Judgment Entry, Aug. 26, 2019).
