The case meets the criteria for postconviction relief under R.C. 2953.21, as it pertains to a constitutional issue that would otherwise be impossible to reach because the evidence supporting those issues is not contained in the record. The petitioner, George Cole, has presented sufficient evidence in the form of affidavits from Danielle Panagopoulos, John Cole, and himself, which could potentially lead to a constitutional issue being addressed. The trial court's summary denial of the petition without holding a hearing and considering the supporting affidavits is considered an abuse of discretion.

 The relevant holding in this case is that the trial court abused its discretion in denying Warren's motion for leave to file a motion for new trial.
