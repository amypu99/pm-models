 Certainly, here's a summary:
    In this case, the appellant, Smith, was convicted of two counts of aggravated murder, one count of murder, and one count of felonious assault. He raised several assignments of error on appeal.

1. The first assignment of error concerned the admissibility of his prior statements to police. The court held that the trial court did not err in admitting the statements, as they were relevant to the issue of Smith's credibility and were not unduly prejudicial.

2. The second assignment of error dealt with the admissibility of certain evidence, including the testimony of a security officer and a trace-evidence examiner.
