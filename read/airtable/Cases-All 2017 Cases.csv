The trial court erred when it concluded that [he] was not a wrongfully imprisoned individual on May 2, 2016.
2. The trial court erred when it denied [him] leave to amend his complaint on November 20, 2015.""

**

{¶145} The Supreme Court’s holding in Johnston is not at issue in the present appeal. Instead, Lemons relies on the Supreme Court’s statement in Johnston where it declined to review Johnston’s claim that he was a wrongfully imprisoned person because the state continued to withhold exculpatory evidence from him after he was sentenced, and thus, there was an ongoing Brady violation — an ongoing “error in procedure” that continued after sentencing and imprisonment. Based on the Supreme Court’s statement, Lemons asserts that the high court has not yet decided the issue of whether a person is a wrongfully imprisoned individual if there was an error in procedure that began before sentencing, but continued after sentencing and imprisonment, that resulted in his or her release. Lemons maintains that in the present case, the state’s ongoing Brady violation amounted to “an error in procedure” that may have originated before he was sentenced, but continued to occur “subsequent to sentencing and during or subsequent to imprisonment” that ultimately resulted in his release. Lemons claims that the state failed to provide exculpatory evidence to him on several occasions subsequent to his sentencing, including when he made a public records request in 2001, until he finally received it when he made “another public records request in 2008.” Therefore, Lemons argues that the trial court should have permitted him to amend his complaint to reassert this claim.

**

{¶147} Lemons further asks this court to address the merits of this issue because sufficient facts were established at trial and there are no material facts in dispute. We agree. The issue of whether there was an error in procedure subsequent to Lemons’s sentencing and during or subsequent to his imprisonment that resulted in his release is a question of law. The facts relating to this issue are not in dispute. The question of law is whether an ongoing Brady violation that continues after a claimant was convicted, sentenced, and sent to prison — meaning the state continues to withhold material exculpatory evidence after the defendant’s trial is over — amounts to an “error in procedure” that occurs “subsequent to sentencing or during and subsequent to imprisonment.” We conclude that an ongoing Brady violation that continues after a defendant was sentenced and is in prison is an “error in procedure” within the meaning of R.C. 2743.48(A)(5).",,"{¶146} We agree with Lemons that the trial court abused its discretion when it denied Lemons’s motion to amend his complaint. There is no evidence of bad faith or undue delay. Moreover, despite its argument to the contrary, the state was not prejudiced by the delay because this argument is merely a question of law — and one that the state thoroughly argued against to the trial court and to this court.

**
{¶151} Thus, after reviewing the law and relevant facts on this issue, and in accordance with App.R. 12(B), we render judgment in favor of Lemons, concluding that he established as a matter of law that he is a wrongfully imprisoned individual under the first prong of R.C. 2743.48(A)(5) because of ongoing errors in procedure that continued to occur long after he was sentenced and sent to prison, which ultimately resulted in his release.

{¶155} We sustain Lemons’s second assignment of error because we agree with him that the trial court abused its discretion when it did not allow him to amend his complaint to reinstate his claim that he was a wrongfully imprisoned individual because he was released from prison due to a procedural error that occurred subsequent to his sentencing and imprisonment under the first prong of R.C. 2743.48(A)(5).
{¶156} We further agree with Lemons that this court can address the merits of his procedural-error claim because we find it to be a question of law that was fully addressed and argued by both parties to the trial court and to this court. In doing so, we agree with Lemons that he established he was a wrongfully imprisoned individual within the meaning of the first prong of R.C. 2743.48(A)(5) because he was released from prison due to an ongoing Brady violation that continued after he was sentenced and sent to prison.

",,,,15 to life,,2016,Summation,"Lee asserts that the prosecuting attorney made improper statements
during his closing argument, including asserting that Lee had no reason to go to the scene if “one is a J-Park member,” that Lee has a “death taxi,” that the area had “ATM bodies that have been killed,” and that it didn’t matter if the victim fired first.
",No error,"Beginning with the prosecuting attorney’s statement that Lee had no reason to go to the scene if “one is a J-Park member,” we note that while such statement, standing alone, would not be a proper argument, in this particular instance, it was a fair comment on the evidence. Lee’s own statement to police indicated that it would not be safe for J-Park members to go to ATM Jack Boyz territory, and a J-Park member would not go there unless he was looking for trouble. In addition, the testimony of S.L. demonstrated that if a J-Park member goes into ATM Jack Boyz territory, he would be there “to fight or something like that.” Accordingly, we find no prejudicial error in connection with this portion of the argument.

He assigns four errors for review:
I. [Pierce] was denied due process of law when he was sentenced for a felony of the third degree when there was no determination by the jury as to what the underlying offense was for the offense of escape.
II. [Pierce] was denied due process of law when the court failed to state [Pierce’s] Batson challenge.
III. Defense was denied due process of law when the court, on its own, did not instruct the jury on intoxication.
IV. [Pierce] was denied due process of law when he was convicted of harassment by an inmate.",No error,"{¶24} Based on the foregoing analysis, we find the mandates of McDonald and Pelfrey to be controlling. As such, we consider only the verdict form itself in determining whether there was compliance with R.C. 2945.75. Pelfrey, 112 Ohio St.3d 422, 2007-Ohio-256, 860 N.E.2d 735, at ¶ 14; McDonald, 137 Ohio St.3d 517, 2013-Ohio-5042, 1 N.E.3d 374, at ¶ 17. It is evident that the dictates of the statute were not followed. The jury verdict form did not state the
degree of the escape offense, nor did it state the most serious offense for which Pierce was under detention when he committed the escape offense.
{¶25} Accordingly, Pierce’s conviction for escape should be reduced to a fifth-degree felony in order to conform to the jury’s verdict form. Pierce’s first assignment of error is sustained.
{¶35} After reviewing the record, we cannot say that the trial court’s denial of defense counsel’s Batson challenge was clearly erroneous. After defense counsel objected to the state’s removal of prospective Juror 6, the trial court thoroughly reviewed the Batson three-part test and gave the prosecution an opportunity to provide its reasons for excusing the juror. The prosecutor provided permissible race-neutral justifications for exercising its peremptory
challenge. In denying defense counsel’s Batson challenge, the trial court evidently concluded that Pierce failed to prove purposeful racial discrimination. Accordingly, we defer to the trial court’s resolution of defense counsel’s Batson challenge.
{¶44} Based on the foregoing analysis, we cannot say that the trial court committed plain error by failing to provide the jury with an instruction on intoxication. Accordingly, Pierce’s third assignment of error is overruled.
{¶52} The testimony of Officers Davis, Petitt, and Hoover, if believed, is sufficient to establish that Pierce caused the officers to come into contact with his blood by expelling the spit and blood in his mouth upon the officers. Accordingly, Pierce’s convictions for harassment by an inmate are supported by sufficient evidence.

Taylor asserts the state's cross-examination of Winbush amounted to prosecutorial misconduct.  The parties agree Taylor did not object to this line of questioning at trial and thus has waived all but plain error.  State v. Jackson, 92 Ohio St.3d 436, 444 (2001).  An appellate court recognizes plain error with the utmost caution, under exceptional circumstances, and only to prevent a miscarriage of justice.  State v. Pilgrim, 184 Ohio App.3d 675, 2009-Ohio5357, ¶ 58 (10th Dist.), citing State v. Diar, 120 Ohio St.3d 460, 2008-Ohio-6266, ¶ 139. ",No error,"{¶ 24} Moreover, to the extent Taylor argues the questions regarding Winbush's criminal conviction were an improper means of impeachment, we note that Evid.R. 609(A)(3) deems admissible evidence that a witness has been convicted of a crime ""if the crime involved dishonesty or false statement.""  Theft is a crime of dishonesty and, thus, can be used for impeachment.  State v. Anderson, 10th Dist. No. 08AP-1071, 2009-Ohio6566, ¶ 25.  In the colloquy above, the state elicits from Winbush the fact of her conviction, not the method of her conviction through no contest plea.  See State v. Mapes, 19 Ohio St.3d 108, 111 (1985) (stating ""Crim.R. 11(B)(2) and Evid.R. 410 prohibit only the admission of a no contest plea.  These rules do not prohibit the admission of a conviction entered upon that plea when such conviction is made relevant by statute"").  Because No. 17AP-103 8 Taylor called Winbush as a witness in an attempt to show Taylor did not know the items in the carts had not been paid for, Evid.R. 609 permitted the state to introduce evidence of Winbush's conviction of a theft offense as a method of impeaching her credibility.  Thus, this line of questioning was not improper and did not render Taylor's trial unfair. 

{¶ 25} For these reasons, Taylor does not demonstrate error, let alone plain error, from this line of questioning.  We overrule Taylor's first assignment of error.

In his third ground for relief, Ojile asserted that he had been denied his right to have counsel present at all critical stages of his prosecution, when Tanks had, after Ojile had been indicted, elicited those incriminating statements as an agent of the Office of the Hamilton County Prosecuting Attorney.",Harmless error,"But Ojile’s convictions for the February 11 aggravated robbery of
Weisbrod and the Duncan and Dao aggravated robberies were not wholly dependent on Tanks’s trial testimony to Ojile’s incriminating statements. Ojile was convicted for the Duncan and Dao aggravated robberies based not only on Tanks’s testimony, but also on evidence that he had been found in possession of the fruits of those offenses. That evidence was not altered by the undisclosed or unavoidably
undiscoverable evidence that, Ojile argued, required the exclusion of Tanks’s
testimony and undermined the credibility of his and Hoover’s testimony. Ojile’s
conviction for the February 11 aggravated robbery was based not just on Tanks’s
testimony, but also on the testimony of Hoover. Neither the Brady claim nor the
right-to-counsel claim, even if demonstrated, would have required the exclusion of her testimony. And the determination of whether her testimony had been credible
was for the trial court, sitting as the trier of fact.

Ojile thus failed to show by clear and convincing evidence that, but for
the Brady and right-to-counsel violations, no reasonable factfinder would have
found him guilty in the Duncan or Dao aggravated robberies or in the February 11,",,Marilyn Zayas ,,"Beth A. Myers, Mark C. Miller ",,Joseph T.

Also given that there were multiple levels of alleged misconduct I think that there could be both harmless error and did not reach error/conduct did not result in prejudice. 

The failure to disclose was a Brady violation but a harmless error. However, Tank's actual testimony was never said to be a violation; instead, the Judge said it didn't matter if it was improper or not because it did not impact the outcome of the case.

Hayden asserted that the absence of his blood group from the victim’s vaginal swab and vaginal aspirate did exclude him. He also asserted that the prosecutor committed misconduct in closing arguments by insisting that the semen at issue was his.,No error,"It is well settled that res judicata precludes a defendant from raising in a new-trial motion any issues that were raised or could have been raised in his direct appeal. Here Hayden’s arguments relied on statements by the prosecutor at trial, testimony by Kiddon at trial, and a lab report used at trial. Therefore, all of the arguments could have been raised earlier... In Hayden IX, Hayden argued, as he does now, that he was entitled to a new trial because “the blood type could only be attribute[able] to the victim.” The trial court rejected this argument, and we affirmed...

Smith,,2016,,Aggravated menacing ,"disorderly conduct, ethnic intimidation ",,,,,,2016,Examination of witnesses,"In the fourth assignment of error, Smith argues that the trial court improperly allowed Kemp's mention of his prison record into evidence, and that the statement was inadmissible character evidence under Evid.R. 404(B).

In his fifth assignment of error, Smith argues that Detective Wilson's
testimony deprived him of a fair trial and violated due process because Wilson improperly opined about Smith's guilt and the credibility of the witnesses.

",Harmful error,"This argument shows that the prosecution wanted to use Smith's
admission that he had a prison record to prove that he had acted in conformity with an aggressive demeanor. This is precisely the type of character evidence that is inadmissible under Evid.R. 404(B). The trial court erred by allowing Kemp's statement to be admitted.

Accordingly, Smith's fourth assignment of error is sustained in part and overruled in part. The assignment of error is sustained with regards to Smith's convictions for ethnic intimidation and disorderly conduct, but overruled with regards to the aggravated menacing charge.

Detective Wilson's flagrant bolstering of Kemp's credibility goes far beyond
what we have previously determined constitutes prejudicial error...Id.

All five references were in the State’s rebuttal closing arguments.""

--

Plott argues that (1) the State improperly introduced evidence of his pre-arrest silence; (3) the State improperly introduced opinion testimony; (4) the State improperly impeached its own witness; (9) the State committed
prosecutorial misconduct (pre-arrest silence and summation.

Pre-arrest silence 1/2: {¶85} In his first assignment of error, Plott argues that the State erred by
introducing testimony related to Plott’s pre-arrest silence as substantive evidence of guilt. We disagree. 

Examination of witnesses: {¶91} In Plott’s third assignment of error, he argues that the State improperly introduced “expert” opinion testimony of Lieutenant Windsor. 

Examination of witnesses: {¶95} In Plott’s fourth assignment of error, he argues that the State improperly impeached Mele, the State’s own witness, with Mele’s prior out of court statement. 

Pre-arrest silence 2/2: In his ninth assignment of error he argues that
the prosecutor committed misconduct “when it introduced testimony relating to [Plott’s] pre-arrest silence,” which was discussed in the first assignment of error. Appt.’s Br., p. 14.

Summation: In his tenth assignment of error, Plott argues that the State
committed prosecutorial misconduct during closing arguments. ",Harmless error,"""Moreover, we would emphasize that this was a single, isolated comment without any suggestion that the jury should infer guilt from it, thus making it harmless under State v. Treesh, 90 Ohio St.3d 460, 480, 2001–Ohio–4.""

-- 

Pre-arrest silence 1/2: {¶90} Moreover, we would emphasize that this was a single, isolated comment without any suggestion that the jury should infer guilt from it, thus making it harmless under State v. Treesh, 90 Ohio St.3d 460, 480, 2001–Ohio–4. 

Examination of witnesses: {¶94} Finally, Plott directs us to no caselaw establishing how this testimony was erroneous. However, even if Lieutenant Windsor’s testimony was erroneous at the time it was entered, we cannot find that it was anything but harmless error in this case. Therefore, Plott’s third assignment of error is overruled. 

Examination of witnesses: {¶105} However, in this case, once the State had asked its foundational questions, to the extent that Mele claimed that she “did not remember” there may have been some impeachment or hearsay questions that were improperly asked by the State without establishing the requisite showing of surprise. Nevertheless, Mele’s testimony is, at best, merely equivocal as to what she did and did not
remember both before and after attempting to refresh her recollection. {¶106} Moreover, even if we were to assume that this entire line of
questioning was improper either as improper impeachment of the State’s own witness or improper hearsay, we cannot find that it was anything but harmless in this case. Mele was not present for the rape of K.D. and she provided no testimony related to the elements of that offense. Thus there could be no impact at all of this testimony on the Rape conviction. {¶107} As to the Domestic Violence and Abduction charges related to Mele,
the primary testimony regarding those charges was provided by K.D., who
witnessed them. K.D.’s testimony was then corroborated in part by Noon and the strangulation expert. The jury was able to see photos of the injuries on Mele’s neck and weigh Plott’s credibility as to his denials. At best Mele was only able to say that she did not remember what happened and it was possible Plott caused the injuries but she also claimed it was possible the injuries were from a fall the night prior. Thus we cannot find that the testimony was anything but harmless error. This is not a situation where absent the victim’s testimony there was no other evidence to convict Plott. There was a witness to the act present whose testimony was corroborated in part by multiple sources. Therefore Plott’s fourth assignment of error is overruled. SEE ALSO DISSENT. 

Pre-arrest silence 2/2:{¶128} In this case, Plott first contends that the prosecutor committed misconduct by introducing testimony related to Plott’s pre-arrest silence. Plott makes essentially the same argument that he made in the first assignment of error as support for his contention. As we found no prejudicial error in the first assignment of error in introducing the brief, isolated statement by Plott that he was turning himself in but would not speak to authorities without an attorney, we similarly can find no prosecutorial misconduct rising to a prejudicial level here. Therefore, Plott’s ninth assignment of error is overruled. 

Summation: {¶131} Thus all of the preceding statements were directly in response to arguments made by defense counsel, which is permissible in closing arguments. There is nothing in the preceding statements that “denigrates” defense counsel; rather, the prosecutor suggests that the arguments and conclusions that defense counsel made in closing argument were not supported by the evidence presented. We can find no error here, let alone prejudicial error. Therefore, Plott’s tenth assignment of error is overruled.

 Crim.R. 16(K) requires that an expert provide a report summarizing the “expert’s testimony, findings, analysis, conclusions, or opinion * **.” In the instant case, the trial court allowed Dr. Likavec to testify without providing an expert report over defense counsel’s objection. His testimony concerned whether the drugs listed on Owca’s lab results would have impaired Owca. 

{¶40} ""In his tenth assigned error, Owca argues that he was deprived of a fair trial when the prosecutor expressed several times that he thought Owca was guilty... The comments that Owca refers to occurred during closing argument.""
",,"{¶29} Although we agree that the trial court erred by allowing Dr. Likavec to testify, we conclude it was not prejudicial error. Other testimony at trial showed that Owca was impaired by the drugs. Hjort testified he saw Owca swerve into oncoming traffic several times. The officers testified to Owca’s inabiliity to stand without assistance and inability to preform the field sobriety tests. The officers also testified to finding baggies of a white substance in Owca’s car. Officer Hansen observed Owca sniffing a sheet of plastic. Additionally, Yingling, who tested Owca’s blood, testified to the lab results and the various drugs and the amounts of each found in Owca’s system. Based on this evidence, Dr. Likavec’s testimony was unnecessary because there was sufficient evidence that Owca was impaired by drugs while driving. This was not a case where there was no evidence regarding what was causing the driver to be impaired. See Cleveland v. Turner, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 99183, 2013-Ohio-3145. Accordingly, Owca’s fifth and ninth assigned errors are overruled.

The prosecutor told the jury that “there were no experts who testified that gave different opinions than the experts who testified in this case. There were two experts. One for speed, one for blood alcohol level. You didn’t hear any other opinions.” The state also told the jury that everyone has a right to a jury trial, “no matter how overwhelming the evidence is.” The entirety of Smith’s legal analysis is that the first statement “improperly shifted the burden of proof away from the State by implying that Appellant was responsible for proving his innocence with competing expert testimony[,]” and the second statement “is highly improper because it implies that the Appellant was abusing the protections of the legal process, given that the state was of the opinion that the evidence in this case was overwhelming against Appellant.”",Did not reach error/conduct did not result in prejudice,{¶4} Such a summarily presented conclusion provides no analysis for us to consider or to which the state could respond.

Medina did so, and passed the case off to Cuyahoga. 

During third trial Hartman filed multiple motions to throw the case out arguing that the state had twice denied him a fair trial with prosecutorial misconduct and that the third trial was in violation of his Fifth Amendment rights under the double jeopardy clause. The court denied these motions.

This appeal is arguing that the court erred in denying these motions. So there's no accusation of new prosecutorial misconduct, but the whole appeal is tied to two prior instances of prosecutorial misconduct, so not sure if it actually meets our standards.

In addition, Garza contends the state introduced evidence that Garcia exercised his constitutional right to remain silent as proof of guilt. Garza admits that he only objected to some of these claimed errors.  

{¶ 50} Towards the end of his testimony on direct examination, the state asked Officer Leist whether he spoke with Garza. Leist stated that he attempted to set up a meeting with Garza and his wife but that neither showed and later he had contact with an attorney stating that Garza would not be interviewed. Officer Leist also testified that on the day of the arrest he asked Garza if he would like to make a statement after being read his Miranda rights. Officer Leist confirmed that Garza did not make a statement. Garza did not object to any of this testimony. If the state violated Garza's constitutional rights under the Fifth Amendment, then we must conclude that the constitutional error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt to sustain Garza's conviction. See Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, paragraph two of the syllabus (1967).",Harmless error,"¶ 51} Unquestionably, this line of inquiry by the prosecutor was highly improper and constituted prosecutorial misconduct. However, we find the prosecutor's misconduct was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. That this was a bench trial again weighs most heavily in our analysis. We can generally presume that the trial court sitting as factfinder understands that pre-arrest and post-arrest silence cannot be used to determine guilt. Moreover, in the scope of the trial these comments were brief. The victim testified, the trial court found her credible, and the victim's allegations were sufficiently corroborated. Garza's reaction of ""I didn't do that"" to the victim's general accusation of ""you know what you did to me"" indicates he was aware of what the victim was accusing him of before entering the laundry room, which he could not have known otherwise. And Garza's unnatural reaction of ""dying laughing"" while listening to the victim relate her allegations further corroborates the victim's claims. Accordingly, we are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that Garza would have been found guilty in the absence of this instance of prosecutorial misconduct.

Brinkley,Black,2016,Robbery/theft,aggravated robbery,,,,,10 years in prison,,2016,Jury selection,"{¶25} In his second assignment of error, Mr. Brinkley contends that the trial court erred in overruling his objection to the State’s use of a peremptory challenge to exclude an AfricanAmerican juror. He argues the reasons provided for dismissing Juror Number 1 were a pretext for eliminating one of two African-American jurors. We disagree. ",No error,"{¶27} Here, the State exercised a peremptory challenge to excuse Juror No. 1, an African–American female, and one of two African-Americans seated among the first twelve jurors. The State indicated that it anticipated a Batson challenge from the defense, and it provided the following as racially-neutral reasons in support of its challenge: (1) Juror No. 1 had been sleeping through the majority of the Defendant’s voir dire, and (2) Juror No. 1 was on a criminal jury approximately two years ago and returned a “not guilty” verdict. Mr. Brinkley raised a Batson challenge, arguing that the given reasons were a pretext. The trial court determined that the State’s given reasons for challenging the prospective juror were race-neutral. Mr. Brinkley disputes that the juror was sleeping, and further argues that several other jurors had previously been involved in a trial. 

{¶30} There is no clear error in the trial court’s determination. The likelihood that the juror was asleep during voir dire, coupled with her sitting on a criminal jury that returned a “not guilty” verdict only two years earlier, gave rise to more than one racially neutral reason why the State might want to exercise a peremptory challenge. There was no discriminatory intent inherent in the prosecutor’s explanations. We further note that there is no pattern of excusing African-American jurors from the venire apparent in the record, and the State did not express similar concerns about any nonminority jurors who were permitted to serve, so there is no indication of disparate treatment. Accordingly, we conclude that the State satisfied its obligation 12 to provide a racially neutral explanation for the challenge under the second step of the Batson analysis. The trial court did not clearly err when it determined that the prosecution had credible racially neutral reasons for excluding the African–American juror. Mr. Brinkley’s second assignment of error is overruled.

2: Pg 18 {¶38} In Fetherolf’s second assignment of error, he argues that the trial court erred by permitting “other acts” evidence that he contends had no bearing on any fact of consequence, and that the trial court erred by failing to exclude details of Fetherolf’s prior conviction and sentence when he did not testify. 

3: Pg 26 {¶56} In Fetherolf’s third assignment of error, he argues that the trial court erred by denying his motion for a new trial. Specifically, Fetherolf contends that the State committed discovery violations by failing to disclose Pamela Hawkins’s 2015 misdemeanor conviction for falsification. 

4: Pg 30 {¶67} In his fourth assignment of error, Fetherolf argues that the prosecutor committed misconduct that deprived him of a fair trial. Specifically, he contends that the prosecutor committed misconduct for eliciting the testimony he claims was erroneous in the first and second assignments of error and that the prosecutor committed misconduct by failing to disclose Hawkins’s prior conviction for falsification referenced in the third assignment of error. ",Did not reach error/conduct did not result in prejudice,"1: Pg 18: {¶37} In this case the consistent statements of A.C. were corroborated by the DNA evidence. The jury was also able to see A.C.’s deposition and at least draw inferences from A.C.’s demeanor as to whether she may have been the victim of sexual abuse or not. We simply cannot find that even if we read the SANE’s isolated statement in the worst possible light that it was so egregious that it rose to the level of plain error or that without the statement the outcome of the trial would have been different. Therefore, we do not find Fetherolf’s arguments well-taken, and his first assignment of error is overruled. 

2: Pg 25, 26 {¶54} Even if we assumed that the testimony related to Fetherolf’s prior conviction was not admissible, it can be argued that it was a valid trial strategy by the defense to allow in testimony that Fetherolf was on probation for a non-violent offense. Fetherolf essentially left the Marysville area right after the alleged incident with A.C. and without another valid reason to leave—such as running from child support—it could have appeared to the jury that Fetherolf was fleeing from a crime against A.C. that he knew he had committed. Thus defense counsel may have wanted this testimony to be introduced for a valid purpose. 

{¶55} Nevertheless, even if we presumed that Fetherolf did object and that the testimony was not admissible, we cannot find that the mentions of Fetherolf’s probation and his felony child support so tainted the proceedings that his convictions must be reversed, particularly given that it had some arguable benefit to the defense. Moreover, the State’s case was relatively strong insofar as statements of A.C. were actually corroborated in this case by the DNA evidence. Therefore, Fetherolf’s argument is not well-taken, and his assignment of error is overruled.

3: Pg 29, 30 {¶65} While the better practice may be for the State to continuously update the criminal records of its witnesses, we cannot find in this case the failure to do so was reversible error. This case was pending for years before it was brought to trial. The State indicated that it disclosed the relevant prior convictions that it was aware of before Hawkins was ever convicted of misdemeanor falsification in a nearby county. Here there is no indication that the State specifically tried to hide anything from the defense, particularly since the State actually elicited testimony from Hawkins that she went to jail and had other convictions. 

{¶66} Finally, given that Hawkins’s credibility was already called into question at trial by admitting that she had prior convictions, admitting that she had gone to jail, and admitting that she was drinking to the point of addiction during the time she spent with Fetherolf, we cannot find that this one additional conviction would have cast such additional doubt on her credibility that it impacted Fetherolf’s convictions. Therefore, for all of these reasons, Fetherolf’s third assignment of error is overruled.  

4: Pg 31 {¶69} Individually, we have found that none of the assigned errors by Fetherolf were reversible. In this assignment of error, he argues essentially that the prosecutor’s cumulative actions render his convictions reversible. Given the evidence in this case, complete with DNA, and as noted earlier the jury’s ability to at least observe and evaluate the victim’s demeanor, even if she did not testify regarding the acts specifically, we cannot find that any errors we have found in this case cumulatively resulted in reversible error based on prosecutorial misconduct. This is particularly true given that defense counsel did not object to some of the testimony, possibly on the basis of trial strategy, and given that some of the testimony elicited was not objectionable at all. Thus we cannot find any prosecutorial misconduct in this case that rises to the level of prejudicial error, and Fetherolf’s fourth assignment of error is overruled.

Jackson, 107 Ohio St.3d 53, 2005-Ohio-5981, 836 N.E.2d 1173, ¶ 131. In this case, there is no dispute that the State failed to disclose the criminal record of a witness as required by Criminal Rule 16. Tr. 289-90. Upon learning of the failure to disclose, Mayse requested that the trial court grant a mistrial. Tr. 289. The State informed the court that there was an error and that attempts had been made to recall the witness, but she had not responded. Tr. 290. The State then proposed a stipulation be read to the jury informing them that the witness had been convicted of a theft offense in 2016 and possession of cocaine in 2010. Tr. 290. The stipulation would also inform the jury that they could consider these crimes when weighing the credibility of the witness. Tr. 291. The trial court overruled the motion for a mistrial and agreed to inform the jury of the prior convictions. Tr. 293. The trial court then advised the jury as follows. The second matter we need to advise you is that the Court wishes to instruct you that [the victim], who testified here yesterday, has been convicted of the offense of possession of cocaine in the year and further was also convicted of the offense of theft in February of 2016. This information that we’re providing you may be used for the purpose of determining the credibility of [the victim]. This information may not be used for any other purposes. Tr. 296. A review of the record contains no evidence that the failure to disclose was willful. 
{¶17} Second, the record does not show how this information would have aided the defense as it was not exculpatory. Mayse claims that this would possibly suggest that the victim was biased, thus implicating the Confrontation Clause as set forth in the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Mayse claims that this is error because the jurors did not get to see the victim’s face when she was questioned about her criminal record. Bias is defined as a “mental inclination or tendency; prejudice; predilection.” Black’s Law Dictionary (10th Ed. 2014). However, the victim’s criminal convictions at issue were not connected with the defendant and she was not given any consideration for her testimony. There is nothing in the record that would show that those convictions would show a prejudice against the defendant. Thus, they do not show a bias. Additionally, the criminal history of the victim was only admissible for the purpose of attacking her credibility. Evid.R. 609. 
{¶18} Finally, even if it would have aided the defense, the defense suffered no prejudice as the trial court fully informed the jury about the victim’s prior convictions. The statement made by the judge may have had more of an impact than merely questioning the witness about the offenses because it drew more attention to the crimes and included a contemporaneous instruction that it could be considered for the purpose of determining the credibility of the victim. Since the jury was fully aware of the charges, there was no prejudice suffered. The failure to disclose is thus not reversible error and the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion for a mistrial.

But the assertions in the motion instead were merely that J.J.'s therapist notified the police following the incident, that J.J. was known to take medication, and that J.J. had admitted to being involuntarily committed (possibly for PTSD) during the pendency of the case. (Mot. for in Camera Review at 2-4.)

Appellant also contends that the evidence was “prejudicial character evidence,” and that the state introduced the jail-house conversations “in order to show [appellant] was crime-prone and violent, and therefore more likely to commit the charged offenses.” Appellant asserts that the marijuana pipe tended to show that appellant used drugs “and therefore [is] more likely to be guilty of the theft of drugs.” ",Did not reach error/conduct did not result in prejudice,"{¶ 47} Even if we assume for purposes of argument that the trial court abused its discretion by determining that the evidence was relevant, we nevertheless believe that any error in admitting the evidence constitutes harmless error.

He argues that the state’s use of that challenge without a valid race-neutral reason violated his right to equal protection. This assignment of error is not well taken. 

2: Pg 8 ¶24} In his second assignment of error, Wright contends that the trial court erred in allowing hearsay to be admitted into evidence. First, he argues that the court erred in finding Marquez Smith to be an unavailable witness and allowing the state to read his prior testimony to the jury


3: {¶42} In his third assignment of error, Wright contends that the trial court erred by allowing other-acts testimony to be admitted into evidence. He argues that the state should not have been allowed to present testimony that Wright was a drug dealer and had committed other crimes, because the only purpose of this testimony was to portray him as a violent criminal. This assignment of error is not well taken. 

4: {¶46} In his fourth assignment of error, Wright contends that the trial court erred by permitting the state to impeach its own witnesses. He contends that the OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS 15 state impeached the testimony of Bonner and Smith without complying with Evid.R. 607. This assignment of error is not well taken

5: 16 {¶51} In his fifth assignment of error, Wright contends that the trial court erred in allowing the prosecutor to introduce improper evidence and commit other misconduct during the trial. He argues that the prosecutor improperly impeached witnesses, introduced improper evidence, improperly vouched for witnesses, and made improper comments during closing argument. This assignment of error is not well taken.",Did not reach error/conduct did not result in prejudice,"1:Pg 7 {¶22} In response to Wright’s objection to the state’s use of the peremptory challenge, the prosecutor provided several reasons for the use of the challenge. He stated that (1) the juror had a religious background and some people “connected to her” ministered to prisoners; (2) she had a strong personality and the prosecutor was concerned that she might not listen and consider all of the evidence; (3) she was overly receptive to the defendant’s point of view of the case as expressed during voir dire; (4) she stated that she would be angry “to the point it would take control over her” if someone suggested something that was not true about her; (5) the prosecutor was not satisfied with her answers when she was asked about people in jail getting case consideration; (6) she indicated that she had known a police officer and that they did not have a “good rapport”; and (7) she indicated that she was “engaged in a profession of exactness.” The prosecutor indicated that it was the “cumulative effect” of all these reasons that caused him to use the peremptory challenge.

Pg 8 {¶23} Thus, the prosecutor provided race-neutral reasons for the use of the challenge. The explanation need not rise to the level of justifying the exercise of a challenge for cause. O’Neal, 87 Ohio St.3d at 409, 721 N.E.2d 73; Williams, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-130277, 2014-Ohio-1526, at ¶ 44. The trial court’s acceptance of these race-neutral reasons was not clearly erroneous. Wright has not met his burden to show discriminatory intent, and we overrule his first assignment of error. 

2: {¶41} In sum, we find no reversible error in the admission of testimony of which Wright complains. Therefore, we overrule Wright’s second assignment of error. 

3: {¶45} The other acts in this case were not independent of the crime but were “inextricably interwoven” with the crime charged in the indictment. See State v. Kendrick, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-080509, 2009-Ohio-3876, ¶ 24. The testimony was necessary to show the relationship between Wright, Parks, and the various witnesses, and Wright’s motive for killing Parks. Consequently, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by allowing the other acts to be admitted into evidence. See State v. Carusone, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-010681, 2003-Ohio-1018, ¶ 29. We overrule Wright’s third assignment of error. 

4: Pg 15 {¶49} Nevertheless, Wright did not object. And we can reverse only upon a finding of plain error. See State v. Underwood, 3 Ohio St.2d 12, 13, 444 N.E.2d 1332 (1983); Lukacs, 188 Ohio App.3d 597, 2010-Ohio-2364, 936 N.E.2d 506, at ¶ 31. We cannot hold that but for the error, the results of the proceeding would have been otherwise. Therefore, the error did not rise to the level of plain error. State v. Wickline, 50 Ohio St.3d 114, 119-120, 552 N.E.2d 913 (1990); Lukacs at ¶ 31. 

{¶50} Smith also testified at the previous trial that he did not remember talking to the police. Impeachment of his testimony would not have been permissible under Evid.R. 607. But his statement was separately admissible under Evid.R. 803(5) as recorded recollection. Therefore, the trial court did not err in allowing it to be admitted into evidence, and we overrule Wright’s fourth assignment of error. 


5: 16 {¶53} Most of Wright’s arguments are a rehash of the arguments in his previous assignments of error, the majority of which we have already rejected. As for the comments in closing argument, Wright failed to object to many of the comments that he now claims were improper. Thus, he cannot raise these issues on appeal unless they rise to the level of plain error. See Underwood, 3 Ohio St.3d at 13, 444 N.E.2d 1332; Lukacs at ¶ 56. Our review of the record shows that even if some of the comments were improper, none were so egregious as to affect his substantial rights or to deny him a fair trial. Therefore, they did not rise to the level of plain error. See Rogers, 143 Ohio St.3d 385, 2015-Ohio-2459, 38 N.E.3d 860, at ¶ 22. Consequently, we overrule Wright’s fifth assignment of error.

We disagree.",No error,"Pg 5 {¶11} Mr. Lewis argues that the Equal Protection Clause was offended when the trial court allowed the State to “singl[e] out Juror [Number] 10 for no reason other than he had a felony conviction * * *.” Yet, “a peremptory challenge may be exercised for any racially-neutral reason.” (Emphasis sic.) State v. Moss, 9th Dist. Summit No. 24511, 2009-Ohio-3866, ¶ 12. The State specifically sought to remove Juror Number 10 because he had a recent, serious felony-level conviction, his conviction took place in the same courthouse, and it had concerns about his ability to remain fair and impartial. There is no indication in the record that the State possessed a discriminatory intent when it sought to remove Juror Number 10 from the venire. See State v. Walton-Kirkendoll, 9th Dist.

Davis,Black,2016,Sexual violence,importuning,,,checked,Female,,,2016,Summation,"Pg 19 {¶26} As the basis of this argument, Davis asserts that the prosecution engaged in prosecutorial misconduct by making the following comment during closing statements: 

Now, what has the [d]efense been in this case? Well, during opening statements, we heard from Mr. Smith [defense counsel]— and again, I’m not a good notetaker. She is, but I’m not. But my recollection was that he said the evidence was going to show that his client wasn’t even there. What evidence have you heard or seen that he wasn’t there? I would suggest that you’ve heard nothing supporting that defense that he wasn’t there. Trial Tr. 183. 

Davis contends that this comment prejudiced his Fifth Amendment right not to testify by leading jurors to “make inferences about Davis’s lack of testimony” and, in so doing, violating his right to a fair trial. Appellant’s Brief, 17. We find this argument to be unpersuasive. ",No error,"Pg 23 {¶33} After examining these statements under these four factors, we find that these comments were not improper. In opening statements, the Defense announced that the primary thrust of their argument at trial would be that Davis was not at home during the times he was alleged to have committed the crime of importuning. Here, the prosecution was merely addressing the Defense’s main argument. This comment does not explicitly address Davis’s Fifth Amendment rights or his decision not to testify. We do not believe that the wording of these statements would have caused the average juror to focus their attention on Davis’s decision not to testify at trial or prompted them to make negative inferences against Davis for exercising his Fifth Amendment rights. Rather, these comments were general statements that pointed to the weaknesses in the Defense’s arguments. Since these comments were not improper, they did not prejudice Davis’s substantial rights and do not amount to plain error. For these reasons, Davis’s fourth assignment of error is overruled.

We disagree. 

15 {¶34} In his fourth assignment of error, Mr. Dawson argues that prosecutorial misconduct deprived him of a fair trial. For the reasons that follow, we reject his argument. 

16 {¶35} During his closing argument, defense counsel argued that Mr. Dawson was inside a nearby gas station at the time officers first arrived at Hyde Park Grille. He offered, based on testimony about the gas station’s security footage, that Mr. Dawson may have walked into the 15 restaurant after it has already been vandalized. The prosecutor then responded to that argument on rebuttal. The prosecutor described the security footage as a “red herring” and referenced the testimony of the detective who stated that the timestamps on such items are usually inaccurate. Mr. Dawson argues that the prosecutor’s remarks were improper because they bolstered the detective’s credibility and relied on facts not in evidence (i.e., the security footage).  ",Did not reach error/conduct did not result in prejudice,"{¶33} Mr. Dawson has not explained why Evid.R. 609(A)(2) applies here, given that the State did not seek to elicit the details of any of his past convictions. Even assuming the rule has some application here, however, the record reflects that Mr. Dawson did not object to the State’s line of questioning. He, therefore, has forfeited this issue for appellate review. See State v. McNeil, 9th Dist. Summit No. 27720, 2016-Ohio-4669, ¶ 20. “Although a party who forfeits an argument still may argue plain error on appeal ‘this Court “generally will not undertake a plain error analysis if [the appellant] fails to do so.”’” State v.

Thomas, 9th Dist. Summit No. 27266, 2015-Ohio-2935, ¶ 15. Because Mr. Dawson has not argued plain error on appeal, we decline to construct an argument on his behalf. His third assignment of error is overruled. 

{¶36} The record reflects that Mr. Dawson failed to object when the prosecutor made the foregoing argument. “[W]hen a defendant fails to object to alleged prosecutorial misconduct, the defendant forfeits all argument except that of plain error.” State v. Warrington, 9th Dist. Medina No. 14CA0080-M, 2016-Ohio-244, ¶ 13. Mr. Dawson, however, has not argued plain error on appeal. Because Mr. Dawson forfeited his objections to prosecutorial misconduct by not objecting and has not argued plain error on appeal, this Court declines to address the merits of his argument.

Pg 16 + pg 17 ¶56} Two of the alleged errors Appellant references are about testimony of bruises on RayVon that occurred a week or so prior to his death. Prior to trial, Appellant filed a motion in limine; it was seeking to prevent the state from offering evidence about two alleged prior instances of Appellant causing injury or handling the child roughly. 1/22/15 Motion. The first instance occurred on November 30, 2012. There was a complaint from Stewart’s neighbor that she saw a guy in a black car handle RayVon roughly by placing him in the car by his collar. 1/22/15 Motion. The second instance occurred sometime in late November or early December. 1/22/15 Motion. Stewart contacted police after RayVon came home from a visit with his father, and had scratches on his face, bruising on both sides of his face, and a split upper lip. 1/22/15 Motion. The case was referred to Children’s Services on December 3, 2012. Over the state’s objection, the trial court granted the motion in limine. 5/22/15 J.E.

{¶57} The state recalled two of its witnesses for rebuttal, Rhea Stewart and Dr. Sterbenz. Stewart was recalled to testify RayVon had a bruise on his face when he went to Appellant’s house on December 8, 2012 and this was an older bruise. It was during this testimony that the alleged nonreversible harmless error occurred. Stewart was asked whether RayVon had any marks on him when he went to Appellant’s home on December 8, 2012. Tr. 1008. She stated he had a mark on his face. Tr. 1008-1009. The state asked how long the child had the mark. Tr. 1009. Stewart replied, “maybe a couple days prior to me dropping him off.” Tr. 1009. Instead of stopping at that point, the state then asked, “What about – since November 30, is that when that mark – came to fruition?” Tr. 1009. Stewart -16- responded yes. Tr. 1009. Appellant objected and moved for a mistrial arguing the ruling on the motion in limine prohibited the state from mentioning the November 30 date and referencing the alleged rough handling of RayVon. Tr. 1009-1013. 
{¶58} The state alleged it was using the testimony to dispute Dr. Ophoven’s testimony that the bruise was caused by resuscitation and was not an old bruise. Tr. 1010. 

{¶59} Upon reviewing the testimony it becomes clear the state did not have to use the November 30 date to make its point. Stewart testified the bruise was there prior to her dropping off RayVon. This disputed Dr. Ophoven’s testimony that the bruise probably happened during resuscitation. It also reinforced Dr. Sterbenz’s testimony that the bruise was an old bruise; Stewart’s testimony may have helped increase Dr. Sterbenz’s credibility. The state did not need to mention November 30 to make its point. Thus, by asking about November 30 specifically, the state’s line of questioning could be seen as an attempt to get the November 30 alleged instance of rough handling before the jury. ",Did not reach error/conduct did not result in prejudice,"Pg 18 {¶64} Considering all three instances in conjunction with each other, this court concludes there is no reversible cumulative error. The reference to the children services investigation in Dr. Ophoven’s testimony was not error. The door was opened by Dr. Ophoven. Any statements regarding prior abuse were objected to, and a response to the question was not permitted. Furthermore, the issue regarding the conversation with the jurors did not warrant the trial court granting a mistrial sua sponte. The jurors indicated they could decide the case fairly. Furthermore, Appellant clearly indicated he wanted the trial to go forward. Potentially harmless error occurred during Stewart’s rebuttal testimony as it related to the November 30 date. However, one instance of harmless error does not amount to cumulative error. ",harmless error,Carol Ann Robb,Carol Ann Robb ,"Gene Donofrio, Mary DeGenaro","Gene Donofrio,Mary DeGenaro",Paul J.

18 {¶47} In his fourth assignment of error, Wilson argues that the trial court erred in allowing the Cleveland police detective who investigated this case to express her belief that Fisher was consistent in his various statements to police regarding the crime. In response to questioning regarding inconsistencies in Fisher’s statements to police, the investigating detective stated: “He’s been consistent from the day that he came out of the coma to the day he testified in this court, in my opinion, on the circumstances surrounding his shooting and the homicide of Miyazhane Vance. “",Harmless error,"17 ¶44} We cannot find any prejudice to Wilson in the limited and largely irrelevant testimony that simply provided an overview of the Cleveland gangs mentioned during trial. The testimony plainly did not implicate Evid.R. 404(B).

2) 18 {¶42} In his third assignment of error, McCray argues that his right to due process was violated by prosecutorial misconduct. Generally, prosecutorial misconduct will not provide a basis for overturning a conviction unless, on the record as a whole, the misconduct can be said to have deprived the defendant of a fair trial. 19 Lott, 51 Ohio St.3d at 166, 555 N.E.2d 293. The test for whether prosecutorial misconduct mandates reversal is whether the prosecutor’s remarks or actions were improper, and, if so, whether they prejudicially affected the substantial rights of the accused. State v. Smith, 97 Ohio St.3d 367, 2002-Ohio-6659, 780 N.E.2d 221, ¶ 45. In most of the instances cited by McCray, he failed to object, so his challenges to the prosecutor’s conduct are reviewed for plain error. See id. 

19 {¶43} A. Voir dire. McCray restates his arguments with respect to the prosecutor’s voir dire. As we have discussed in our resolution of the second assignment of error, no plain error occurred in voir dire. See Thompson at ¶ 163. 

19 {¶44} B. Leading questions. McCray contends that the prosecutors “asked improper leading questions with impunity throughout trial.” McCray objected to just one of the challenged questions. In that instance, the prosecutor asked if the witness remembered McCray’s having made a particular statement about the gun “at or about the time that you took it from him.” Defense counsel objected, and the trial court asked the witness whether he had remembered any conversation with the defendant. The witness clarified that McCray had not made the statement until after the witness had taken the gun. Because the trial court stepped in to restate the question so that it was not leading, McCray cannot demonstrate that prejudice resulted from the question. See State v. Diar, 120 Ohio St.3d 460, 2008-Ohio-6266, 900 N.E.2d 565, ¶ 172. 

{¶46} C. Closing argument. McCray argues that the prosecutors made prejudicial comments and incorrect statements during closing argument. A prosecutor is entitled to a certain degree of latitude in closing argument. State v. Grant, 67 Ohio St.3d 465, 482, 620 N.E.2d 50 (1993). A prosecutor may draw reasonable inferences from the evidence presented at trial and comment on those inferences in closing argument. Treesh, 90 Ohio St.3d at 466, 739 N.E.2d 749. We review a prosecutor’s closing argument in its entirety to determine whether the allegedly improper remarks were prejudicial. State v. Were, 118 Ohio St.3d 448, 2008-Ohio-2762, 890 N.E.2d 263, ¶ 198. In this case, except for two instances, McCray failed to object and thus forfeited all but plain error. See State v. Pickens, 141 Ohio St.3d 462, 2014-Ohio-5445, 25 N.E.3d 1023, ¶ 109. 

",Harmless error,"1) 18 {¶41} While generally it is error to comment on a defendant’s being in jail, when taken in context, the prosecutor was attempting to determine whether jurors would fairly consider evidence of recorded calls. The prosecutor explained: The reason I bring that up is I had a jury once where a juror felt that was unfair, that because he’s locked up that he’s - - it’s an unfair advantage to the State to be able to record his calls from a correctional facility; that somehow puts him at a disadvantage if he wants to use the phone. Does anybody feel that way, that somehow it’s really not fair to him to listen to his calls and play those somewhere down the road if they are relevant to this case? Everybody good with that? Okay. We hold that, even if the trial court erred by allowing the prosecutor to mention that the calls were made from jail, it was not plain error. See Thompson, 141 Ohio St.3d 254, 2014-Ohio-4751, 23 N.E.3d 1096, at ¶ 73. We overrule the second assignment of error. 

2) 27 {¶63} vii. Closing argument conclusion. After reviewing the prosecutors’ closing arguments in their entirety, we hold that, although the prosecutors made some improper remarks, these remarks “did not permeate the state’s argument” so as to deny McCray a fair trial. See Thompson, 141 Ohio St.3d 254, 2014-Ohio-4751, 23 N.E.3d 1096, at ¶ 203. Consequently, we overrule the third assignment of error. ",prosecutorial misconduct,Beth A. Myers,Beth A.

Mr. Baskerville acknowledges that he did not object to any of the photographs that are the subject of his argument, so he asks this Court to find plain error in their admission. Upon review, this Court rejects his argument. 

2) 18 {¶37} In his fifth assignment of error, Mr. Baskerville argues that the trial court erred when it permitted the State to impeach its own witness. Because Mr. Baskerville has not explained how he was prejudiced by the court’s error, if any, this Court rejects his argument.  

3) 19 {¶40} In his third assignment of error, Mr. Baskerville argues that prosecutorial misconduct deprived him of a fair trial. This Court disagrees.  ",Did not reach error/conduct did not result in prejudice,"1) 17, 18 {¶36} Although Mr. Baskerville ultimately admitted having stabbed the victim in his case-in-chief, it was still the State’s burden to prove the elements of murder and felonious assault.

Moreover, they were not duplicative, as they depicted different areas of the victim’s body. See State v. Feaster, 9th Dist. Summit No. 24367, 2009-Ohio-2558, ¶ 24-27. Upon review, Mr. Baskerville has not shown that the trial court committed plain error when it admitted the photographs. His fourth assignment of error is overruled. 

2) 19 {¶39} Mr. Baskerville argues that the trial court erred when it allowed the juvenile to testify that he heard a statement about a gun. He argues that the juvenile’s testimony was improper because the State essentially had to impeach him to elicit it. Yet, even assuming the procedure here was flawed, Mr. Baskerville has not explained how that error affected his substantial rights. See Crim.R. 52(A). The victim died as a result of a stabbing, not a shooting, and there was no suggestion at trial that either Mr. Baskerville or the victim possessed a gun at the time of this incident. Additionally, the juvenile who testified readily admitted that he could not recall what was said about a gun or which man even uttered that statement. Under these facts and circumstances, Mr. Baskerville has not shown that he suffered any prejudice as a result of the trial court’s error, if any. See id. As such, his fifth assignment of error is overruled. 

3) 21 {¶44} This Court likewise rejects Mr. Baskerville’s argument that he was deprived of a fair trial when the prosecutor impeached his own witness. As discussed in Mr. Baskerville’s fifth assignment of error, Mr. Baskerville has not shown that he suffered prejudice as a result of the admission of the 14-year-old witness’ testimony. Absent a showing of prejudice, he cannot succeed on his prosecutorial misconduct argument. See id. Thus, his third assignment of error is overruled. ",prosecutorial misconduct,Lynne S.

Appellant points to these remarks without demonstrating how these remarks constitute prosecutorial misconduct. ",Did not reach error/conduct did not result in prejudice,"28 {¶58} Even if the remarks were in any way improper, the transcript reflects the trial court reminded the jury after closing arguments that “what counsel says in closing argument includes their theories of the case. Not one word that is said by the attorneys in this case, not opening statements, not a question, not a comment, not closing arguments, constitute evidence. It’s not to be considered as such.” Thus, the trial court properly instructed the jury that it must decide the case based on the evidence and that closing arguments were not evidence.

Defense counsel repeatedly objected to Officer Cottrell’s testimony. Appellant argues that the trial court erred by permitting the officer to testify as an expert pursuant to Evid.R. 702 and pursuant to the principles gleaned from Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct. 2786 (1993).1 However, since the officer was not previously disclosed as an expert and did not submit an expert report pursuant to Crim.R. 16, defense counsel was precluded from appropriate cross-examination. Furthermore, Officer Cottrell’s conclusions were the only link between the common household items and the alleged methamphetamine lab. Appellant concludes Officer Cottrell’s testimony was well outside the limited circumstances in which lay witness opinion is proper under Evid.R. 701.",No error,"16 {¶28} We find Corporal Cottrell’s testimony was proper lay opinion well within the providence of Evid.R. 601.

This asserts that prosecutorial misconduct denied appellant his right to a fair trial and due process of law under the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Ohio Constitution, Article I, Sections 10 and 16. In reviewing a claim of prosecutorial misconduct, we inquire first whether the prosecution's statements or actions were improper, and, if so, whether they prejudiced the defendant's substantial rights. State v. Treesh, 90 Ohio St.3d 460, 480 (2001). Otherwise stated, a prosecuting attorney's conduct during a trial does not constitute grounds for error unless the conduct deprived the defendant of a fair trial. State v. Keenan, 66 Ohio St.3d 402, 405 (1993). See also Smith v. Phillips, 455 U.S. 209 (1982) (""the touchstone of a due process analysis in cases of alleged prosecutorial misconduct is the fairness of the trial, not the culpability of the prosecutor""). The effect of the prosecutor's misconduct must be considered in light of the whole trial. State v. Durr, 58 Ohio St.3d 86, 94 (1991). 

26 {¶ 83} The improper conduct cited by appellant concerns the prosecutor's misinterpretation and reliance on a rarely invoked legal theory known as the ""doctrine of No. 14AP-679 26 chances,"" telling the jury that under this theory they could conclude that cumulative testimony as to multiple criminal acts would be probative, on the basis of sheer probability, as to the occurrence of at least some of the acts. At closing, for example, the prosecution repeatedly asked the jury ""what are the odds?"" (Tr. at 3756.) ""[W]hen is this no longer a coincidence, but the truth?"" (Tr. at 3757.) ""Again what are the odds, and when does this stop being a coincidence and being the real thing?"" (Tr. at 3758.) The prosecution summed up closing by saying, ""[n]ow that's the doctrine of chances and this case is a classic example of it."" (Tr. at 3758.) No objection was made to these comments. 

27 {¶ 87} Also in connection with the state's closing statement, appellant argues on appeal that the prosecution improperly expressed the belief that appellant had lied and that his defense witnesses had lied on the stand. The attacks on appellant's veracity were also combined with application of the supposed doctrine of chances: ""[I]f that case is legit, and I suggest to you that it is overwhelmingly, then they're all legit, because of the doctrine of chances and because everything that he's told you in this courtroom is a lie."" (Tr. at 3770.) ",Harmless error,"27 {¶ 86} Although the state clearly misstated and improperly applied the doctrine of chances here, under a plain error standard we can discern no grounds for reversal. The verdicts indicate that the jury rejected the invitation to blend testimony regarding one offense into its determination regarding another, and remained willing to consider each accuser's testimony on its own merits as each offense, reaching an independent conclusion on the various charges. There is no basis to conclude that, but for the state's comments in this respect, the outcome of the trial would clearly have differed. 

28, 29{¶ 93} Finally, we note appellant's objection to the prosecutor's use of the term ""prey"" repeatedly during closing when referring to the accusers in the case. We find that ""[w]hile certainly vivid, the words are not inflammatory or improper in the contexts quoted."" State v. Scharf, 6th Dist. No. OT-01-010 (Nov. 9, 2001). Appellant also objects to remarks concerning appellant's expressed belief that he was the object of a conspiracy between the county prosecutor, the attorney general's office, and the police. In closing, the prosecutor dismissively told the jury that she expected that appellant would have everyone in the courtroom wearing ""tinfoil hats, and the defendant was going to produce the second shooter from the grassy knoll."" (Tr. at 3644.) Again, while the prosecution succeeded in casting appellant's suspicions in colloquial terms invoking a crackpot conspiracy theory, vivid language is not necessarily improper language, and this did not constitute misconduct, particularly when we consider the closing arguments in their entirety to assess prejudice. See generally State v. Moritz, 63 Ohio St.2d 150, 157 (1980). ",harmless error,William A. Klatt,,"Lisa L. Sadler, G. Gary Tyack",,Mike Dewine,,Daniel J. Breyer,,"Frederick D. Benton Jr., Jennifer L.

Specifically, appellant contends that the trial court erred in allowing several witnesses to testify as to M.L.’s statements that appellant hurt him. 

assignment 4: 15 {¶ 36} In his fourth assignment of error, appellant asserts that the trial court erred in allowing Burr to testify that she believed that M.L. was physically abused and that appellant was the perpetrator of the abuse without first being qualified as an expert. Undoubtedly, Burr was not qualified as an expert in this case. Under Evid.R. 701 and 704, a lay opinion on the ultimate issue to be decided by the trier of fact may be given if the standards of admissibility under Evid.R. 701 are met. See Lee v. Baldwin, 35 Ohio App.3d 47, 49, 519 N.E.2d 662 (1st Dist.1987). Pursuant to Evid.R. 701, lay opinion testimony must be: “(1) rationally based on the perception of the witness and (2) helpful to a clear understanding of the witness’ testimony or the determination of a fact in issue.” 

assignment 5: 17 {¶ 42} In his fifth assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court erred in allowing Dr. Schlievert to testify because his expert report did not comply with Crim.R. 16(K). ",Harmless error,"assignment 3: 14 {¶ 33} As noted above in our recitation of the facts, M.L.’s statement to Trevino was precipitated by Trevino asking M.L. if somebody hurt him. This question was neither coercive nor leading in that it did not seek to implicate any particular individual or suggest a specific answer. Rather, Trevino’s question merely enabled M.L. to convey his thoughts. Moreover, the question did not destroy the domination of the nervous excitement over M.L.’s reflective faculties. Therefore, we find that M.L.’s response to Trevino’s question was admissible at trial under the excited utterance exception. 
{¶ 34} Finally, Urbina also referenced M.L.’s statement during his testimony, stating that he was informed by the first responders that M.L. had a broken leg and that M.L. had stated that appellant injured him. This testimony does not constitute hearsay because, when considered in its context, it was not offered for the truth of the matter asserted but, rather, in order to explain Urbina’s investigative process. Even assuming for the sake of argument that Urbina’s statement constituted inadmissible hearsay, its admission was harmless in light of the fact that M.L.’s statements were referenced by Trevino and J.H. See Crim.R. 52(A) (“Any error, defect, irregularity, or variance which does not affect substantial rights shall be disregarded.”). 
{¶ 35} Accordingly, appellant’s third assignment of error is not well-taken. 

assignment 4: 16 {¶ 39} Notwithstanding our finding that the trial court erred in allowing Burr to express her opinion that appellant abused M.L., we find that the error is harmless. Error is harmless if “there is no reasonable possibility that the evidence may have contributed to the accused’s conviction.” State v. Bayless, 48 Ohio St.2d 73, 357 N.E.2d 1035 (1976), paragraph seven of the syllabus. In considering the issue of harmless error appellate courts are to “assess the impact” of the inadmissible testimony on the jury. State v. Rahman, 23 Ohio St.3d 146, 151, fn. 4, 492 N.E.2d 401 (1986)

assignment 5: 20 {¶ 48} In sum, we find that Dr. Schlievert’s testimony was based on his personal observations and perceptions, was not entirely unexpected in light of his timely disclosure as an expert witness, and did not impact the outcome of the trial given the remaining admissible evidence. Therefore, we hold that this case does not present the sort of exceptional circumstances that would require reversal in order to prevent a manifest miscarriage of justice.

Encarnacion,,,Robbery/theft,aggravated robbery,firearm specification,,,,,,,Summation,"{¶ 8} In his sole assignment of error, Encarnacion argues that his convictions should be reversed because the prosecutor engaged in misconduct during closing argument. This assignment of error lacks merit. 

{¶ 9} Prosecutors are afforded considerable latitude in closing argument. State v. Ballew, 76 Ohio St.3d 244, 255 (1996). A prosecutor may comment on "" 'what the evidence has shown and what reasonable inferences may be drawn therefrom.' "" State v. Lott, 51 Ohio St.3d 160, 165 (1990), quoting State v. Stephens, 24 Ohio St.2d 76, 82 (1970); see State v. Leonard, 104 Ohio St.3d 54, 2004-Ohio-6235, ¶ 159 (""A prosecutor may state an opinion if based on evidence presented at trial.""). However, a prosecutor may not express his personal belief or opinion as to the credibility of a witness, the guilt of an accused, or allude to matters that are not supported by admissible evidence. State v. Smith, 14 Ohio St.3d 13, 14 (1984). Thus, a prosecutor should not make references to his or her personal experiences. State v. Stevens, 3d Dist. No. 1-14-58, 2016-Ohio-446, ¶ 77. ",No error,"{¶ 12} Although the prosecutor's statements regarding his personal experiences and observations about lineups and evidence collection were not based on evidence presented at trial, any related error was not plain error. Under Crim.R. 52(B), an appellate court may take notice of ""plain errors"" even when ""they were not brought to the attention of the court."" For an error to constitute ""plain error"" under Crim.R. 52(B), it must satisfy three prongs: (1) there must be an error, meaning a deviation from a legal rule, (2) the error must be ""plain,"" meaning an ""obvious"" defect in the trial proceedings, and (3) the error must have affected ""substantial rights,"" meaning the error must have affected the outcome of the trial. State v. Barnes, 94 Ohio St.3d 21, 27 (2002). An appellate court recognizes plain error with the utmost caution, under exceptional circumstances, and only to prevent a miscarriage of justice. State v. Pilgrim, 184 Ohio App.3d 675, 2009-Ohio-5357, ¶ 58 (10th Dist.), citing State v. Saleh, 10th Dist. No. 07AP431, 2009-Ohio-1542, ¶ 68. The defendant bears the burden of demonstrating plain error. State v. Perry, 101 Ohio St.3d 118, 2004-Ohio-297, ¶ 14. Encarnacion has not met
this burden as to the prosecutor's statements regarding lineups, DNA, and fingerprints. 
{¶ 16} Contrary to Encarnacion's argument, the prosecutor did not improperly attempt to shift the burden of proof to him. ""The prosecution is not prevented from commenting upon the failure of the defense to offer evidence in support of its case."" State v. Williams, 23 Ohio St.3d 16, 20 (1986). ""Such comments do not imply that the burden of proof has shifted to the defense, nor do they necessarily constitute a penalty on the defendant's exercise of his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent."" State v. Collins, 89 Ohio St.3d 524, 527-28 (2000). Hence, a prosecutor is not precluded ""from challenging the weight of the evidence offered in support of an exculpatory theory presented by the defense [or] arguing the defendant's failure to provide evidence to support proffered theories of excuse or innocence."" Id. ""Pointing out the failure of a defendant to subpoena witnesses to prove his theory of the case does not constitute shifting-of-the-burden misconduct."" State v. Leach, 150 Ohio App.3d 567, 2002-Ohio-6654, ¶ 48 (1st Dist.). See State v. Petro, 148 Ohio St. 473, 498 (1947) (""[T]he fact that one of the parties fails to call a witness who has some knowledge of the matter under investigation may be commented on.""). Therefore, it was not improper for the prosecutor to comment on the lack of corroborating testimony to support Encarnacion's videotaped explanation to a police detective regarding his whereabouts on the night of the robbery. Nor was it improper for the prosecutor to respond to defense counsel's contention that the state should have subpoenaed telephone records with the argument that he could have provided those records if he believed they would be exculpatory.

Brooks’ argument appears to be that prosecutorial misconduct occurred with respect to the prosecution of count 7 (renumbered count 3) of the indictment, which he alleges led to what he labels a “sham legal process[.]” He also appears to assert that the trial court punished him at sentencing for taking the case to trial and for being found not guilty of count 7 (renumbered count 3). Further, he maintains that the trial court imposed a 5 year license suspension that was contrary to law.",Did not reach error/conduct did not result in prejudice,"5 , 6 {¶13} This Court has held that “[a] judgment may only be reversed for prosecutorial misconduct when the improper conduct deprives the defendant of a fair trial. The defendant must show that, but for the prosecutor’s misconduct, the trier of fact would not have convicted him.” (Internal quotations and citations omitted.) State v. Moreland, 9th Dist. Summit No.27910, 2016-Ohio-7588, ¶ 22. Here, Brooks was found not guilty of count 7 (renumbered count 3). Accordingly, even assuming there was prosecutorial misconduct with respect to the State’s prosecution of count 7, we fail to see how Brooks was prejudiced by it in light of the acquittal on that count. Thus, Brooks cannot demonstrate he is entitled to a new trial. See id. ",prosecutorial misconduct,Donna J. Carr,Donna J. Carr,"Thomas A. Teodosio, Lynne S. Callahan","Thomas A. Teodosio,Lynne S.

We disagree with Powell’s arguments. ",No error,"17 {¶35} We conclude that there is no clear error in the trial court’s determination. The State provided multiple racially neutral reasons why it sought to exercise a peremptory challenge on Juror No. 27, namely that she and a relative have both been victims of domestic violence and that she was “unhappy” about a relative’s criminal case that previously occurred in Summit County and where the Akron Police Department was involved in the investigation. Accordingly, we conclude that the State satisfied its obligation to provide a racially natural explanation for the challenge under the second step of the Batson analysis. Accordingly, the trial court did not clearly err when it determined that the State had credible neutral reasons for excluding the African-American juror. ",Batson v. Kentucky,Julie A.

The claim is that he should have been informed he was allowed to withdraw his guilty plea. I read it as DNMS even though they reference an allegation of prosecutorial misconduct, because the court never addresses that claim, instead seeming to dismiss the whole thing on the basis of the court's error (as opposed to the state's error). However, they do also mention that ""there is nothing in the record to indicate that the state was requesting a greater sentence than it had agreed to"" in the original plea, indicating that the court was, at least in part, treating one of appellant's earlier arguments as that the state reneged on a plea deal, despite the assignment of error being against the trial court.",,2017-Ohio-5688.pdf (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/40/40/1745100000000/lQYpbsPN2pi8C5rjdTdmpg/iJzt6H3HM1KjgU0X_YivMjAeKw9XqJVv1f-fnPAKd3HVHsAlOK8s36ZF6bbHroUvdseBQ18yXRCzY0upbmxakMkbAn-iVR2pJzvHfyecNVBVxCASzpcyL5_irwRzb7zdU_Yqq-OE0grKkvggZkxeu7rESkPTiMUdlkm19KE-zKc/846zS69KGKba-nj__3aiznItxWs9Eg6NLfC40DPNEik),2017-Ohio-5688,,,,,,,checked,"""Allegation of error is against the court, not the prosecutor/state"",No allegation of prosecutor misconduct",,,,Katherine Rose Coyle,,Curtis Brodner,,,,2011-CR-310,,,E-16-024,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Smith testified she received consideration for her testimony at trial and Rowley was provided ample opportunity to impeach Smith on this issue through cross-examination as well as he addressed the issue in his closing argument. Furthermore, the prosecutor's remarks concerning the criminal justice system provided context for the consideration Smith received, and ultimately, it is up to the jury to weigh the credibility of the evidence. Moreover, the trial court instructed the jury that closing arguments were not evidence and we presume the jury will follow the instructions given to it by the judge. State v. Loza, 71 Ohio St.3d 61, 79 (1994).
{¶ 42} In considering the prosecutor's remarks concerning Kurkilko's testimony, we find any alleged error harmless. The prosecutor stated Kurkilko could visually see the school from the searched residence, and that Kurkilko looked up the location of the residence on the county auditor's website to determine the residence was located within the 1,000 feet of a school. While Rowley correctly asserts the prosecutor's remark about seeing the school is absent from Kurkilko's testimony, such error is harmless because it restated the evidence presented in a different manner, which was that Kurkilko determined the location of the residence was within 1,000 feet of a school. Absent the remark concerning Kurkilko's line of sight from the residence, the outcome of the trial would not have been different. Accordingly, Rowley's third assignment of error is overruled.

THE STATE ALSO FAILED TO MAKE THE TRIAL COURT AWARE OF HIS INVOLVEMENT
{¶ 13} This assignment of error relates to Prospective Juror #11, a deputy with the Clark County Sheriff’s Department (the “Deputy”). According to Quinn, the State “knew, or should have known[,] that [the] Deputy * * * was involved in [his] case,” but neither the State nor the Deputy himself disclosed as much to the trial court during voir dire. Appellant’s Br. 5-6. Quinn posits that the alleged failure to disclose “constitutes prosecutorial misconduct.” Id. at 6. He presented the same issue as the first assignment of error in his application to re-open this appeal. ",Did not reach error/conduct did not result in prejudice,"{¶ 14} In our decision granting Quinn’s application to re-open, we noted that although he was thus “attempt[ing] to raise a new issue regarding pre-trial discovery of [certain] police reports written by the Clark County Sheriff’s Office,” which he “asserts * * * were not provided during pre-trial discovery,” he did “not establish[] that the pertinent documents are part of the trial court record.” Decision & Entry 3-4, May 11, 2016. As a result, we “limited [this re-opened appeal] to the issue[s] regarding * * * potential error[s] in the jury selection process.” Id. at 4.

Dudley,,,Robbery/theft,theft,,,,,2 years,,,"Summation,Other or unknown","{¶12} In her first assignment of error, Ms. Dudley argues that the prosecutor engaged in misconduct during closing argument, which deprived her of a fair trial. This Court disagrees. 

{¶15} In her second assignment of error, Ms. Dudley asserts that the trial court committed plain and prejudicial error by allowing the prosecutor to mislead the jury about Ms. Dudley’s “flight” from the Macy’s department store without giving a jury instruction in that regard. Ms. Dudley acknowledges that her trial counsel objected to the prosecutor’s statements at trial, but notes that he did not request a supplemental jury instruction on “flight.” She, therefore, argues that her trial counsel’s failure to request a supplemental instruction requires this Court to review the matter under the plain-error standard.",Did not reach error/conduct did not result in prejudice,"{¶14} Ms. Dudley argues that the prosecutor engaged in misconduct during closing argument when he indicated that police officers activated their overhead lights in an attempt to stop Ms. Dudley’s vehicle, and that Ms. Dudley sped away and eluded capture, which was not supported by the evidence. This Court’s review of the prosecutor’s closing argument, however, indicates that the prosecutor was simply providing a hypothetical example – which did not include the use of Ms. Dudley’s name – and was not suggesting that Ms. Dudley fled from the police. Even if the prosecutor had intended such a suggestion, our review of the record as a whole indicates that Ms. Dudley received a fair trial, and that the prosecutor’s remark did not affect the outcome of the trial. Accordingly, Ms. Dudley’s first assignment of error is overruled. 

¶16} Despite asserting that the plain-error standard applies, Ms. Dudley has not developed an argument in that regard. She simply cites case law explaining the plain-error  standard, and concludes that “[i]n light of the prejudicial and misleading nature of the prosecutor’s remarks * * *, it was plain error for the trial court not to give the jury a clarifying instruction on ‘flight[.]’” Such a conclusory statement is insufficient for purposes of establishing error on appeal. See App.R. 16(A)(7). As this Court has consistently stated, “[i]f an argument exists that can support [an] assignment of error, it is not this [C]ourt’s duty to root it out.” Cardone v. Cardone, 9th Dist. Summit No. 18349, 1998 WL 224934, *8 (May 6, 1998), citing App.R. 12(A)(2) and 16(A)(7). Accordingly, this Court disregards Ms. Dudley’s second assignment of error.

The remaining grounds for
relief presented in Ojile’s postconviction petition challenge Tanks’s trial testimony to incriminating statements allegedly made to him by Ojile during their confinement in the Hamilton County Justice Center, concerning the aggravated robberies of Weisbrod, Duncan, and Tao. 

In his second ground for relief, Ojile contended that he had been denied a fair trial by the state’s failure to disclose in discovery impeachment evidence contained in the sealed portion of a plea agreement between Tanks and federal prosecutors, which provided for a “downward departure” in Tanks’s federal prison sentence in exchange for his “substantial assistance” in the prosecution of other offenders. 

In his third ground for relief, Ojile asserted that he had been denied his right to have counsel present at all critical stages of his prosecution, when Tanks had, after Ojile had been indicted, elicited those incriminating statements as an agent of the Office of the Hamilton County Prosecuting Attorney.",Did not reach anything/ reverses on other grounds,"Neither the Brady claim nor the right-to-counsel claim, even if demonstrated, would have required the exclusion of her testimony.

{¶35} Ojile thus failed to show by clear and convincing evidence that, but for the Brady and right-to-counsel violations, no reasonable factfinder would have found him guilty in the Duncan or Dao aggravated robberies or in the February 11, 2009 aggravated robbery of Weisbrod.

{¶7} Conyer argues appellate counsel failed to argue in the initial appeal that the prosecutor failed to disclose favorable evidence which would have been used to impeach the state’s witnesses Sharron Winphrie and Shayla Blair. Conyer is asserting a Brady violation.",Did not reach error/conduct did not result in prejudice,"{¶10}  Furthermore, the record before us does not indicate the state failed to provide this information to Conyer and his counsel. That said, Winphrie’s criminal history was not raised during her testimony.

That failure, however, does not necessarily mean the state failed to disclose her criminal history. There could be multiple reasons why it was not brought to the attention of the jury. 

{¶11} Even if we could assume Winphrie’s criminal history was not disclosed to the defense and amounted to a Brady violation, any error is harmless.  In this case, there was overwhelming evidence of guilt. 
{¶12} For those reasons this assignment of error fails. There is no probability that a Brady argument would have had any success in the initial appeal.

{¶ 56} Brown contends that improper conduct by the prosecutor during trial requires a reversal of his convictions. 
{¶ 58} Although not clear, it appears that Brown accuses the prosecutor of failing to timely reveal the existence of a potentially exculpatory witness. 

{¶ 65} Brown next contends that the prosecutor asked improper questions of Jordan regarding the surveillance tapes. Specifically, he argues that the State impermissibly led Jordan to opine that Brown appeared hostile in the tapes. 

{¶ 62} Brown next argues that the prosecutor misled the jury by indicating that Howard’s injuries were caused by a single blow from Brown’s truck. A review of the record shows that during closing argument, the prosecutor stated, “[Pollack] testified that it’s unlikely that one blow caused all of those injuries like slipping and falling.

{¶ 70} Finally, Brown appears to raise a claim that the prosecutor made numerous  inflammatory statements during closing argument",No error,"{¶ 59} We cannot conclude, from this record, that the prosecutor acted improperly. There is no showing that the prosecutor had the information prior to the second day of trial. Further, the record indicates that the prosecutor gave the information to the defense as soon as practicable after its discovery. Given that counsel was afforded a chance to pursue the information, was offered a continuance of the trial, and ultimately
indicated that the information was not beneficial to the defense, we find no prejudice. Thus, we find this claim lacks merit. 

At no point did Pollack opine that Howard’s injuries could not have been caused by one blow from a pickup truck. Thus, we cannot say that the prosecutor improperly misled the jury by indicating that Howard’s injuries were caused by being hit by Brown’s truck. 

Thus, to the extent that Brown invites us to review the record for evidence of other claimed errors without a citation to the record as required by App.R. 16(A), we decline. It is not our duty to search the record for evidence supporting an appellant's argument. State v. Montgomery, 2d

The trial court abused its discretion when it failed to grant Phillips’s
motion for leave to file a motion for new trial or hold a hearing where he
established that the state failed to disclose material exculpatory evidence, in violation of his right to due process.

2. The trial court abused its discretion when it failed to grant Phillips’s
motion for leave to file a motion for new trial when the record demonstrated by clear and convincing proof that Phillips was unavoidably prevented from discovering the evidence within 120 days of his conviction.

3. The trial court abused its discretion when it failed to hold a hearing on
Phillips’s motion for leave to file a motion for new trial when the record
and circumstances supported Phillips’s claim that he was unavoidably
prevented from discovering the new evidence. ",Did not reach anything/ reverses on other grounds,"{¶25} It is at the hearing on the motion for leave that the court must determine whether the petitioner met his burden of clearly and convincingly showing that he was indeed unavoidably prevented from discovering the evidence. 

{¶26} Because Phillips submitted evidence that on its face showed he was
unavoidably prevented from discovering the evidence sooner, Phillips was entitled to a hearing on his motion for leave. We therefore agree with Phillips that the court abused its discretion when it concluded that Phillips did not meet his burden of proof, without first giving Phillips a chance to present his evidence in open court.

{¶27} Given the disposition on appeal, we find that the first and second
assignments of error are moot. Accordingly, we reverse and remand to the trial court for a proper evidentiary hearing on the motion.

violation of Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), and, thus, he could not have knowingly and intelligently entered his guilty plea. 

Appellant claimed that the state failed to disclose the existence of text messages between Officer Ellenwood and the victim.
 Appellant argued that the text messages contain evidence of an inappropriate, intimate relationship between Officer Ellenwood and the victim. Appellant asserted that the officer’s conduct undermines his credibility as a witness, as well as the credibility of the information that he obtained from the victim. Appellant contended that the officer likely used the relationship “to dissuade [the victim] from recanting her accusations.” 

Appellant thus argued that the evidence concerning Officer Ellenwood’s conduct would have allowed him to impeach the officer at trial and that the evidence constituted material evidence under Brady. Appellant argued that the state’s failure to disclose the evidence concerning Officer Ellenwood entitled him to withdraw his guilty plea and have his sentence vacated. ",No error,"The court found that the text messages reveal that “the officer counseled the victim toward recovery from [appellant]’s behavior, encouraging her to read books, watch movies, go to church, make good choices, seek counseling to help her address what she was experiencing.” The court did not find the material to contain any exculpatory evidence and that
it contains “marginally, if at all, impeachable” evidence. The court thus determined that none of the information constitutes relevant, material, or discoverable evidence.","Brady v.

erroneously rejected Keith’s claim of a Brady violation in this case.

{¶36} On appeal, Keith claims that the State at least inadvertently suppressed Yezzo’s personnel file, that Yezzo’s file contained evidence favorable to Keith as it was impeachment evidence of a witness he characterized as “critical,” and he argues that absent Yezzo’s testimony the evidence linking Keith to the crime was minimal. ",Did not reach error/conduct did not result in prejudice,"{¶41} Over the years in his numerous appeals and post-conviction petitions Keith has challenged many aspects of his case and the evidence against him, but one fact remains clear, the evidence against Keith was simply overwhelming.

 Both at his trial and following his convictions Keith has strongly pursued the defense that another man committed the killings, specifically Rodney Melton. That theory was presented at trial, along with multiple
other individuals the defense contended were the potential killers. Rodney Melton, along with the others, actually testified for the jury to see and hear and the jury rejected the defense’s theories.

there is no reasonable possibility that the information contained in Yezzo’s file would have made any difference in the outcome of this case.
{¶42} For all of these reasons, Keith’s second assignment of error is
overruled.

Appellant history
This Court provided a history of Keith’s various attempts to overturn his conviction up to 2011 in State v.Keith, 3d Dist. Crawford No. 3-10-19, 2011-Ohio-407. The following is a brief summary of that history.
Keith filed his first petition for post-conviction relief in 1998, which was denied and the denial was affirmed on appeal. State v. Keith, 3d Dist. No. 3-98-05, 1998 WL 487044. In 1999 Keith filed a habeas corpus
petition in a federal district court presenting eight grounds for relief, which was denied in 2001. That habeas petition was appealed and denied on appeal by the Sixth Circuit. Keith v. Mitchell, 455 F.3d 662 (C.A.6,
2006). In 2004 Keith filed a second petition for postconviction relief, which was denied, appealed to this Court, and the denial was affirmed. In 2007, Keith filed a motion for leave to file a delayed motion for new
trial, which was denied, and he also filed a motion to reopen his direct appeal which was denied and affirmed by the Supreme Court of Ohio. State v. Keith, 119 Ohio St.3d 161, 2008-Ohio-3866. In 2008 Keith filed a
motion for an evidentiary hearing for his motion for new trial, which was denied and affirmed on appeal. 
State v. Keith, 3d Dist. Crawford No. 3-08-15, 2008-Ohio-6187. In 2009 the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals
denied Keith’s request to have a second habeas corpus petition considered. Keith v. Bobby, 551 F.3d 555 (2009). In May of 2010, Keith filed another motion for leave to file a delayed motion for a new trial arguing that the State had improperly suppressed evidence. The trial court denied that motion and it was affirmed by this Court on appeal. State v. Keith, 3d Dist. Crawford No. 3-10-19, 2011-Ohio-407. In March of 2014, it appears that Keith filed another Habeas petition in United States District Court, which was transferred to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals due to being a successive petition",https://www.supremecourt.ohio.gov/rod/docs/pdf/3/2017/2017-Ohio-5488.pdf,2017-Ohio-5488.pdf (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/40/40/1745100000000/4fxIJJHOWIQvR2T4IaZMVw/QY-DKLU-dKjcIj_S51G-G13a6M8fIKPvRjxT4ma9jt6BZsdK3ip252HOiLtG3zQMte2gmm-78WkF3IbQSlh4gtgRqXiEYH6XrZUbjatnw1J4Jj6y4M9oYYhDjyLBa042ssq7YH9lrskTMw8dUMbk3w/u5wh2Hf5JWfTRtZ5InKmeT55gW9tAPs2qf1sM_iYlf8),2017-Ohio-5488,,Ohio District Court,Affirmed,,10/19/2022,checked,checked,Trial is before 2001,,,Jake Belford Kincaid,,,Jake Kincaid,,CJI,,94-CR-0042 ,,,3-17-01,,checked,http://clerk.crawford-co.org/cgi-bin/db2www.pgm/cpq.mbr/main?nuser=11:43:00,,"There is an interesting memorandum by the Ohio Prosecuting Attorneys Association in support of jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to review this trial (https://www.supremecourt.ohio.gov/pdf_viewer/pdf_viewer.aspx?pdf=831318.pdf&subdirectory=2017-1100\DocketItems&source=DL_Clerk), and more interestingly, and accusation blaming a former forensic analyst with Ohio’s Bureau of Criminal Investigation (BCI),  G.

disclose exculpatory evidence it had in its possession.
{¶110} In his fourth assignment of error, Dahms argues that he was denied
due process of law because the State failed to disclose 181 jailhouse calls. It appears that Dahms is arguing that the State’s failure to disclose those jailhouse calls amounted to a “Brady violation.” ",No error,"{¶112} As an initial matter, Dahms’s reliance on Brady is misplaced because Brady involves the discovery of evidence after trial. [...] Dahms concedes that he received the jailhouse phone calls prior to the start of trial. (See Appellant’s Brief at 26). (See also Apr. 26, 2016 Tr., Vol. I, at 111). As such, no Brady violation exists.

¶120} Therefore, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by preventing the State from using the jailhouse calls not provided through discovery as evidence—that is, imposing the least severe sanction that it determined to be consistent with the purpose of the rules of discovery.

court erred in failing to either dismiss the case or grant a mistrial due to a consistent pattern of discovery violations by the State. 

Applying Crim.R. 16 and the Brady requirements to the facts presented to us for review, we will discuss each alleged discovery violation in turn. 
...

{¶28} Owens contends that Davon Meggison’s (“Meggison”) criminal
history was not properly disclosed. Specifically, Owens asserts that the prosecution failed to disclose that Meggison was arrested out of the same incident involving Owens; that Meggison had been arrested on a probation violation; and that Meggison was currently under indictment as well.

{¶29} Owens asserts that the failure to disclose the criminal history of
Meggison materially affected his attorney’s ability to adequately prepare and present a proper defense. However, this court has consistently determined that materiality does not refer to the defendant’s ability to prepare for trial. State v. Wangler, 3rd Dist. Allen No. 1-11-18, 2012-Ohio-4878, ¶ 115, quoting United States v. Agurs, 427 U.S. 97, 113, 96 S.Ct. 2392 (1976), holding modified by United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667, 105 S.Ct. 3375 (1985). Moreover, Owens has put forth no assertion that the undisclosed evidence in regards to Meggison’s criminal history was favorable to Owens’ case, let alone material to Owens’ conviction.
Furthermore, Meggison’s criminal history was discussed, in part, during his testimony

{¶30} During the course of the trial, Owens’ attorney discovered that
Shaquille Smith (“Smith”), a witness for the State, had reached a plea deal with the State in exchange for his testimony against Owens.

Upon notice of this plea deal, the trial court recessed the jury and independently investigated the allegation. It was determined that Smith was charged with Permitting Drug Abuse, a felony of the fifth degree, in violation of R.C. 2925.13, arising from the February 9, 2016 incident involving Owens. The State advised the trial court it had a plea agreement with Smith, and that such agreement had not been disclosed to defense counsel. 

{¶34} Lastly, Owens’ contends that the State failed to comply with the rules of discovery by not disclosing the address of Keese, its confidential informant.",Harmless error,"Moreover, Owens has put forth no assertion that the undisclosed evidence in regards to Meggison’s criminal history was favorable to Owens’ case, let alone material to Owens’ conviction.
Furthermore, Meggison’s criminal history was discussed, in part, during his testimony. There is nothing in the record to indicate that Meggison’s full criminal history, if disclosed, would have impacted the verdict in light of Owen’s admissions of guilt to three of the four charges. ....

DISCOVERY

with respect to the failure of the State to disclose its recorded
statement of Smith under Crim.R. 16(L)(1), the trial court permitted Owens’ attorney ample review of the tape prior to concluding cross examination which resulted in greater questioning of Smith. The trial court properly interceded and regulated the discovery process consistent with the rules of discovery, which resulted in the impeachment of Smith. We find the trial court’s curative measures were sufficient to resolve any potential prejudice to Owens. 
..
While not condoning the multiple discovery errors committed by the
State in this case, we find that there was no material discovery violation that would have changed the jury’s verdict in light of Owens’ admissions and the evidence presented at trial. Accordingly, we overrule the third assignment of error. ",Brady v. Maryland,Zimmerman,William R. Zimmerman,"PRESTON, P.J. concurs.

Parsons argues that the State’s failure to disclose that evidence amounted to a “Brady violation.” ",No error,"{¶77} As an initial matter, Parsons’s reliance on Brady is misplaced because Brady involves the discovery of evidence after trial

{¶82} As an initial matter, we note that the principles of Youngblood may be inapplicable to Parsons’s argument since there is no evidence in the record that Kern identified the Honda Civic by its unique sound to law enforcement.. As in Brown, Parsons is alleging that law enforcement failed to collect Kern’s statement in a report or recorded statement of Kern. See id. However, we will assume without deciding that Parsons’s argument falls within the meaning of the “failure to preserve” evidence under Youngblood.

{¶83} Even assuming that Kern’s statement is potentially useful evidence,
Parsons failed to prove that it was not preserved in bad faith. There is no evidence in the record that Kern stated to law enforcement that he identified the Honda Civic as belonging to Parsons based on its unique sound. Stated differently, there is no evidence in the record that law enforcement, or the State, failed to disclose Kern’s statement. Indeed, our review of the record reveals that this evidence was first introduced at trial during Kern’s direct examination. (Mar. 7-8, 2016 Tr. at 18).
 For these reasons, Parsons failed to prove that law enforcement acted in bad faith. As such, there is no due process violation.

The state improperly and unconstitutionally withheld exculpatory
impeachment evidence from the defense in violation of the discovery rules and its obligation under Brady v. Maryland. 

{¶10} In his second assignment of error, appellant asserts that the state
impermissibly withheld information regarding the criminal records of several witnesses. He argues that he could have used these records on
cross-examination to impeach these witnesses
Appellant argues that he was not fully apprised of the case against him, which made his plea invalid.",Did not reach error/conduct did not result in prejudice,"{¶16} Appellant has not provided this court with the necessary information to determine this assignment of error in his favor.

Further, appellant has not alleged how the failure to provide any of the criminal backgrounds of certain witnesses
prejudiced him. He baldly asserts that the state’s failure resulted in prejudice. He does not explain how the lack of criminal histories of certain witnesses impacted his ability to properly address the merits of the state’s case against him. Therefore, this court overrules the assigned error.

In his brief, Valdez alleges violations of both Crim.R. 16 and Brady v. Maryland. We disagree

{¶115} In the present case, Valdez contends that there were several discovery violations committed by the State that were improperly handled by the trial court. Several of those violations were for the failure to disclose four of the State’s witnesses",Harmless error,"{¶125} Valdez also argues that the State’s failure to disclose Detective
Baldridge’s notes regarding the “proffer” constituted reversible error. The State clearly violated Crim.R. 16 by failing to disclose the detective’s notes. The State’s argument that the prosecutor was unaware that the notes existed is irrelevant as the prosecutor is accountable for all information in the possession of law enforcement.

{¶127} Regarding the four witnesses that were not properly disclosed,
Valdez has failed to prove how their testimony was favorable or how it rendered his trial unfair. 

{¶128} Valdez also argues that Detective Baldridge’s notes constituted
Brady material and that the failure to disclose the notes resulted in prejudice. We are not convinced. 
Additionally, the notes were disclosed at the earliest time possible since the notes were discovered after the prosecutor left the office for the night. Finally, Valdez has failed to show any resulting prejudice.

grounds that he recently discovered the victim had admitted to his wife (the victim’s mother) in November 2014, that the accusations against him were false. Clark claims that he became aware of this information through a July 7, 2015 correspondence from his wife. Clark also claims that the State’s caseworker was made aware of the supposed false allegations in November 2014, but the “exculpatory” information provided to the caseworker was never disclosed to his defense counsel in violation of Brady v. Maryland,

{¶ 6} Clark attached two affidavits in support of his motion. One of the affidavits was prepared by his wife, who averred that in the beginning of November 2014, the victim (her daughter) told her that it was not Clark who had abused her, but two of the victim’s  uncles. After the victim changed her story and accused Clark of being one of her abusers, Clark’s wife averred that she had called and advised the caseworker that the victim had changed her story. According to Clark’s wife, the caseworker merely responded by saying “that might happen.” Clark’s wife also averred that on November 19, 2014, the victim told her that she had decided to accuse Clark of abuse so she could live with her biological father, and then moved in with her biological father on November 22, 2014. 
",Did not reach anything/ reverses on other grounds,"{¶ 23} In this case, it appears as though a number of the Calhoun factors apply to discount the credibility of Clark’s supporting affidavits. However, it is not this court’s place to judge the credibility of the affidavits or to rule on Clark’s motion/petition, as the decision to grant or dismiss the petition with or without a hearing falls within the sound discretion of the trial court.

The prosecutor asked about Yanez's burglary convictions from 2005 and 2012, and Yanez does not challenge that the state could use such convictions to impeach his credibility as a witness. However, Yanez claims that the state's actual purpose in addressing the convictions was to suggest that Yanez was planning to commit burglary on the night of the incident. During the state's cross-examination, the prosecutor asked Yanez why he was wearing a bandanna on the night in question, and why he was in possession of a flashlight and wire cutters. After Yanez answered the prosecutor's questions, the prosecutor asked, ""Sure you weren't out there doing something else?"" and
later asked, ""You've been convicted multiple times of burglary?""
{¶ 27} Yanez next argues that the prosecutor committed misconduct by stating during closing argument that part of the defense strategy was to suggest that a police conspiracy occurred during its investigation into the incident. During the state's closing argument, the prosecutor stated ""now it's a conspiracy. Now, the police are involved. * * * Now the police are in on it."" The prosecutor also alluded to Yanez's prior convictions for burglary and mentioned Yanez's testimony that he was wearing gloves, carrying wire cutters, and a flashlight.
{¶ 30} Yanez also claims that the prosecutor engaged in misconduct when he stated, ""you don't put a convicted felon on the stand to tell you the truth. You just don't."" Yanez claims that the state hoped to convince the jury that he was a liar and to mislead the jury into believing that the defense strategy was to have Yanez testify and lie in order to escape conviction. However, the evidence at trial indicated that Yanez claimed that he was the victim and that he was acting in self-defense at the time of the stabbing. Thus, the state was merely making an argument that Yanez's testimony lacked credibility or corroboration. As previously stated, for example, Yanez claimed to have been beaten and kicked by the stabbed men, but he showed no sign of injury when police arrived on the scene.
{¶ 32} Yanez also argues that the prosecutor engaged in misconduct when making a comment on the 9-1-1 call reporting the incident to police. The call, which was made by one of the men stabbed, was played to the jury. During closing arguments, the prosecutor stated, ""I want you to listen to that 9-1-1 call. See if you hear fear in [the man's] voice. I did."" While we find the prosecutor's statement misguided in referring to himself, it does not rise to the level of plain error.",No error,"{¶ 34} After a review of the record, the statements alleged above did not constitute prosecutorial misconduct, individually, or collectively. Instead, the jury heard ample evidence that Yanez stabbed the victim after demanding his wallet, and the evidence corroborated the victim's testimony that he was assaulted rather than Yanez acting in self-defense. We find no plain error in the state's comments or questions during trial, as there is no indication in the record that absent the comments or questions, the result of Yanez's trial would have been different. As such, Yanez's second assignment of error is overruled.",,Piper ,,S. Powell and M. Powell,,Michael T. Gmoser,,,,Scott N. Blauvelt,,"This case involves appeals of two separate cases against the defendant.

(Appellant's Brief at 13.) For the following reasons, we disagree.",No error,"{¶43} This exchange appears to fall short of the test for whether a Doyle violation has occurred as set forth in Angus and Froe. The exchange between the prosecutor and the detective is limited to one question in which the prosecutor confirms appellant did not provide a statement to detectives, and the prosecutor did not comment or stress to the jury an inference of guilt from appellant's silence as a basis of conviction. On the whole, this exchange seems more ""isolated"" rather than ""extensive."" Froe at ¶ 62; Angus at ¶ 16. As a result, we cannot say that appellant has demonstrated that an obvious error occurred.
{¶45} While we agree with appellant's assessment that a Doyle violation may result in plain error, we disagree that appellant has met his burden to prove plain error in this case. First, as stated above, the comment is of an isolated nature and was not emphasized by the prosecution. Second, even without the detective's reference to appellant's invocation of his right to counsel, the jury still heard other evidence, specifically appellant's call to police and testimony of first responders regarding his behavior, that showed appellant failed to assert he did not fire the shotgun on purpose. Furthermore, based on this evidence, plus Smith's testimony and call to 911, overwhelming evidence exists in this case to establish appellant's guilt. Neal at ¶ 39. Considering the above, we cannot say but for the error, the outcome of the trial would clearly have been different. Id. Therefore, appellant has not demonstrated plain error.",Doyle v. Ohio,"Lisa L.

The photo contained an unidentified individual holding a gun taken on an unidentified date. The note was typed into the “Notes” section of the phone about two hours before Anderson was robbed and included statements about trying to get money and looking in someone’s pockets or wallet.
{¶16} In his second assignment of error, Lee contends that the assistant prosecuting attorney engaged in misconduct when he (1) improperly introduced the photograph and note discussed above, (2) led every witness—to the point of testifying himself—and characterized one piece of evidence as “damning” during his direct examination of the detective, and (3) accused defense counsel of coaching witnesses and made other improper statements during closing. Lee admits that his counsel did not object to this alleged misconduct. Therefore, he must demonstrate plain error. See State v. Pickens, 141 Ohio St.3d 462, 2014-Ohio-5445, 25 N.E.3d 1023, ¶ 109. To constitute plain error, an error must be an obvious defect that would clearly, but for the error, have resulted in a different outcome of the trial. State v. Neyland, 139 Ohio St.3d 353, 2014-Ohio-1914, 12 N.E.3d 1112, ¶ 177, quoting State v. Long, 53 Ohio St.2d 91, 97, 372 N.E.2d 804 (1978).",Harmless error,"{¶18} We have already determined that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the photograph and note. Therefore, there can be no prosecutorial misconduct in introducing those pieces of evidence.
{¶19} Lee also argues that the assistant prosecuting attorney committed misconduct when he characterized a piece of evidence as “damning” during a direct examination. However, Lee did not object and has not explained how he was prejudiced. See State v. McKelton, 148 Ohio St.3d 261, 2016-Ohio-5735, 70 N.E.3d 508, ¶ 264. As a result, he has not demonstrated that the outcome of the trial would have been different but for the use of that term.

accepting the state’s rationale for using a peremptory challenge to dismiss an African-American jury panel member.
{¶33} In this matter, the defense made a Batson challenge after the state used a peremptory strike to strike a young African-American male who worked in retail. The state then explained that “he is close in age to the age of these defendants * * * and he’s from Cleveland Heights, which from past unfavorable jury verdicts” led him to conclude that the juror would “tend to side more with the defense.” The defense countered that a young Caucasian female college graduate was not stricken and that “Cleveland Heights is a completely fair and neutral territory.” The court found the state’s explanation to be sufficient, stating:
[I]t’s not that there has to be a pattern that has been expressed. It could be made on the first. I believe he’s the first African-American the State is excusing here and they state it’s because he’s of similar age of the defendant, not based solely on race. There’s plenty of other African-Americans on this jury. And the record will reflect that the first two causal challenges were made against African-American jurors, * * * [which] were initiated by the defense in this case.
I believe the State satisfied their burden and I’ll overrule the Batson challenge.",No error,"{¶37} Applying the foregoing, we hold that the prosecuting attorney could put forth residence as a racially neutral basis for the peremptory challenge, so long as it is not actually a pretext or surrogate for racial discrimination. In this matter, there is no basis in the record upon which to conclude that that prohibition was violated herein.

“Appellant was denied equal protection of the laws and his rights under the
Fourteenth Amendment as a result of systematic removal of African-American jurors and the racially-based appeal of the prosecution.”
{¶65} Lastly, Appellant argues: “with all the African-American jurors removed, the prosecution made an explicitly race-based appeal to the all white jury during the rebuttal portion of its closing argument” which “constituted prosecutorial misconduct that prejudiced Kalontae and denied him a fundamentally fair trial.” (Apt. Br. 13-14, 18). In reviewing a claim of prosecutorial misconduct in closing argument, the reviewing court is to evaluate whether remarks were improper and, if so, whether they prejudicially affected the defendant’s substantial rights. State v. Lott, 51 Ohio St.3d 160, 165, 555 N.E.2d 293 (1990). The prosecution is afforded wide latitude in summation. Id. Furthermore, “[n]ot every intemperate remark by counsel can be a basis for reversal.” State v. Landrum, 53 Ohio St.3d 107, 112, 559 N.E.2d 710 (1990) (the question is the fairness of trial, not the culpability of the prosecutor). The state's closing argument must be viewed in its entirety. State v. Treesh, 90 Ohio St.3d 460, 466, 739 N.E.2d 749 (2001). “It has been observed that comments made in direct response to arguments advanced by opposing counsel are unlikely to constitute a ground for reversal.” Cosgrove v. Omni Manor, 7th Dist. No. 15 MA 0207, 2016-Ohio-8481, ¶ 57, citing, e.g., State v. Hill, 75 Ohio St.3d 195, 204, 661 N.E.2d 1068 (1996) (holding the defendant “can scarcely complain” where his counsel had previously and repeatedly used variations of the same language contested by the defendant).",No error,"{¶59} This court concludes the reason provided by the prosecution for exercising a peremptory challenge as to prospective juror two was properly deemed to be race-neutral. At stage two of the Batson analysis, the state's explanation need not be “persuasive, or even plausible” (and can be silly or superstitious) as long as the reason is not inherently discriminatory. Rice, 546 U.S. at 338; Purkett, 514 U.S. at 768-769 (an evaluation of the persuasiveness of the explanation does not arise until the third step). As for stage three of the Batson analysis, neither the prosecution nor the trial court believed the juror’s answers to certain complicity questions. The court found the prosecutor’s concerns (due to prospective juror two’s abrupt turnabout) were credible, were honest, and were not pretextual. The trial court’s decision in overruling Appellant’s Batson challenge to the state’s peremptory challenge of prospective juror two is not clearly erroneous.
{¶69} Considering the fact the state was responding to these comments by defense counsel and viewing the state’s closing argument in its entirety, the contested statement in the prosecutor’s rebuttal did not deprive Appellant of a fair trial.

In each instance, Dorothy did not object. She is therefore limited to a review for plain error. State v. Cotton, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2003-06-159, 2004-Ohio-4409, ¶ 19. Under a plain error analysis, a reviewing court will not reverse a conviction ""unless, but for the error, the outcome of the trial clearly would have been otherwise."" State v. Dougherty, 12th Dist. Preble No. CA2013-12-014, 2014-Ohio-4760, ¶ 54.
{¶ 30} Dorothy contends that during closing arguments the prosecutor improperly stated that Victoria's use of force to remove Dorothy from the property could establish the force element of trespass in a habitation. Dorothy cites these comments:
If she has to use force to eject her from the property, then force was used. If she's resisting, then force was used. * * * If you go to someone's house and they've told you to leave and you don't leave, then they can use force lawfully against you. And that force is force sufficient for the charge. * * * She had to use force to eject me from the property.
{¶ 32} Next, Dorothy argues that during voir dire the prosecutor provided the jury with an expanded definition of reasonable doubt. The prosecutor stated:
But there is the legal standard in the case as the judge explained is the State has to prove the charges beyond a reasonable doubt. Now, that does not mean beyond all doubt, beyond a shadow of a doubt. Whatever kinds of other things because it's a legal term and the judge is going to give you an instruction about what that means. What I usually tell people is, it means that at the end of the day when you've heard all of the evidence, you feel comfortable going home and saying I did the right thing, right? I gave it my best effort and I did the right thing. I am comfortable with my decision.
{¶ 35} Dorothy next argues that the prosecutor engaged in excessively emotional argument during closing by stating that ""we know that there was a long-standing bad relationship going on there"" between Dorothy and Victoria, and that Dorothy ""didn't go there to be nice. She went there to try to get Victoria to give her stuff back."" We find no error here. The prosecutor's statements were fair comment on the evidence presented. Victoria's testimony as well as Dorothy's statements on the dash-camera video would support the conclusion that Victoria and Dorothy's relationship was at times strained. Dorothy was amiable in her own version of events. Thus, the prosecutor's comments were appropriate in arguing against Dorothy's credibility. There is no error here, much less plain error.
{¶ 36} Finally, Dorothy argues that the prosecutor improperly ""bolstered"" Victoria's testimony by repeatedly asking Victoria if she told the truth when discussing the incident with police officers and in her written statements. Bolstering is improper and occurs where a lay witness testifies as to another witness' veracity. State v. Cappadonia, 12th Dist. Warren No. CA2008-11-138, 2010-Ohio-494, ¶ 36. ""[I]t is the fact-finder who bears the burden of assessing the credibility and veracity of witnesses."" Id. at ¶ 17. Victoria was not offering an opinion as to her own truthfulness or someone else's truthfulness. Consequently, this was not improper bolstering. The jury could decide for themselves whether Victoria was being truthful when asked about telling the truth.",Harmless error,"{¶ 31} The prosecutor's comments were accurate statements of the law with respect to force. As discussed previously, any force used to enter or remain is sufficient for purposes of establishing a violation of R.C. 2911.12(B). Testimony at trial established that Victoria had to push Dorothy by her shoulders to make her leave the property; thus, Dorothy was exerting some force in opposition. There is no error here, plain or otherwise.
{¶ 33} The standard instruction on proof beyond a reasonable doubt describes it as ""proof of such character that an ordinary person would be willing to rely and act upon it in the most important of the person's own affairs."" Ohio Jury Instructions, CR Section 405.07. The prosecutor's description of reasonable doubt as based on a juror's ""comfort"" with the verdict does not comport with the instruction on the state's burden of proof and was therefore erroneous and improper.
{¶ 34} Nonetheless, Dorothy cannot demonstrate plain error. The trial court instructed the jury that it was the court's ""duty to instruct [the jury] on the law that applies to this case[,]"" and that it was the jurors' ""sworn duty to accept these instructions and to apply the law"" given by the court. Thereafter, the court provided the jurors with the proper instruction defining the state's burden of proof. Additionally, for the reasons set forth in response to the first and second assignments of error, this court concludes that the outcome at trial would not have changed but for the prosecutor's comments.
{¶ 35} Dorothy next argues that the prosecutor engaged in excessively emotional argument during closing by stating that ""we know that there was a long-standing bad relationship going on there"" between Dorothy and Victoria, and that Dorothy ""didn't go there to be nice. She went there to try to get Victoria to give her stuff back."" We find no error here. The prosecutor's statements were fair comment on the evidence presented.

Alhashimi further asserts the trial erred by permitting the state to use text messages between Alhashimi and A.K. to refresh a witness's recollection that the prosecutor provided to the defense less than 48 hours before trial.,Did not reach error/conduct did not result in prejudice,"{¶ 57} Crim.R. 16(B)(4) provides that the state shall, upon a written demand for discovery by the defendant, provide to the defense ""results of physical or mental examinations, experiments or scientific tests."" Contrary to Alhashimi's claim otherwise, the officer's testimony regarding his stride measurements in the parking lot does not constitute a scientific test. See State v. Goble, 5 Ohio App.3d 197 (9th Dist.1982), paragraph two of the syllabus (finding ""common-sense"" investigative work performed by an officer regarding possible routes taken by a defendant does not constitute discoverable ""scientific tests or experiments""). Rather, the stride measurements taken by the officer constituted routine police observations and Alhashimi had the opportunity to cross-examine the officer on the issue. Further, Alhashimi was on notice that the state intended to present evidence regarding juveniles within 100 feet of the area of the transaction, as discussed above. Therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in permitting testimony regarding the officer's stride measurements.
{¶ 58} With respect to the text messages, the trial court found the prosecutor did not willfully fail to disclose the text messages, but limited the scope of the messages use at trial to refreshing a witness' recollection or as demonstrative aids. Assuming arguendo the prosecutor willfully failed to disclose the text messages, Alhashimi does not assert any resulting prejudicial effect. While Alhashimi expresses his displeasure with the timing of the prosecutor's disclosure of the text messages, he does not demonstrate how the timing of the disclosure prejudiced him. See State v. Litton, 12th Dist. Preble No. CA2016-04-005, 2016- Ohio-7913, ¶ 13 (finding appellant's claim pursuant to Crim.R. 16 failed because appellant could not demonstrate any resulting prejudice); State v.

“THE YOUNGSTOWN CITY PROSECUTOR FAILED TO IDENTIFY THE RULE 11 PLEA AGREEMENT AND REASONS FOR THE AGREEMENT. THE COURT ERRED WHEN IT FAILED TO INQUIRE OF THE STATE OR CONSIDER THE RULE 11 AGREEMENT AND BASIS OF THE SAME.”
{¶20} Appellant is attempting to argue, in part, the prosecutor breached the plea agreement by failing to voice the sentencing recommendation contained in the written plea agreement. For instance, the state failed to orally announce it recommended a three-day jail sentence (or a driving intervention program) for OVI.

Hiler also contends he did establish that the criminal record was not provided to his trial attorney. In support, he cites Exhibit 2 to his new-trial motion, which he claims is the discovery his attorney received. Hiler notes that Sparks’ criminal record is not among those materials. He also alleges that various attorneys failed to obtain the criminal record at issue. Finally, in his second assignment of error, Hiler contends the trial court erred in failing to hold a hearing to determine whether he was unavoidably preventing from discovering Sparks’ criminal record.",Did not reach error/conduct did not result in prejudice,"{¶ 7} Upon review, we find both assignments of error to be unpersuasive. As set forth above, Hiler sought a new trial under Crim.R. 33(A)(2), which involves prosecutorial misconduct, and Crim.R. 33(A)(5), which involves an “[e]rror of law occurring at the trial.” Under Crim.R.33(B), Hiler had 14 days after the jury’s verdict to file his motion. Because he did not do so, Crim.R. 33(B) obligated him to establish by “clear and convincing proof” that he “was unavoidably prevented from filing his motion for a new trial” within the required time.
{¶ 11} Hiler does not argue on appeal that he had no reason to suspect the existence of Sparks’ criminal record. To the contrary, he professes to have had long- standing knowledge or suspicion of its existence, as evidenced by the fact that he purportedly has asked four different attorneys to obtain it for him. (Appellant’s brief at 1). Although Hiler contends he had no way to obtain the record until a friend contacted him in prison, Hiler acknowledges that the record has been available on-line and that his friend obtained it that way. The trial court was not required to accept Hiler’s claim that it took him nearly three and one-half years to locate someone with internet access or other means who would obtain the record for him. At a minimum, rejection of this argument was not an abuse of discretion. Compare State v. Roberts, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 95533, 2011-Ohio-2534, ¶ 19 (“Additionally, the police reports and court documents attached to Roberts’s petition have been a matter of public record since 2006. Thus, Roberts has not demonstrated that he was unavoidably prevented from discovering the facts upon which he bases his petition.”); State v. Smith, 2d Dist. Miami No. 97 CA 46, 1998 WL 404458, *5 (Mar. 27, 1998) (“* * * the fact of [defendant’s] incarceration, without more, does not amount to clear and convincing proof that he was unavoidably prevented from discovering [allegedly withheld] evidence within the time limitations of Crim.R. 33(B)”); State v. Neguse, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 99AP-843, 2010-Ohio-1387, ¶ 12 (“The second piece of evidence offered by appellant in support of his motion for new trial was the denial of the existence of any criminal convictions by witnesses Meadows and Fitzgerald when asked about their criminal records at trial. Nothing in the materials offered by appellant in support of his motion offer any basis to conclude that appellant was unavoidably prevented from discovering this evidence during the 120-day period for filing a timely motion for new trial.”).
Concurrence:
{¶ 15} The alleged discovery violation conceivably could constitute prosecutorial misconduct. But Crim.R. 33(C) requires a new-trial motion based on prosecutorial misconduct to be supported by an affidavit showing the truth of the allegations. Hiler’s affidavit only addressed his delay in seeking a new trial. Nowhere in that affidavit did Hiler aver that the prosecutor possessed but failed to turn over Sparks’ criminal record, which is the essence of the misconduct claim. This court has recognized that a Crim.R. 33(A)(2) motion is subject to dismissal when a defendant fails “to attach an affidavit showing the truth of his allegations of prosecutorial * * * misconduct, as required by Crim.R. 33(C).” Smith at *5; see also State v. Dudley, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 23613, 2010-Ohio-4152, ¶ 43 (“A trial court does not abuse its discretion by denying a motion or hearing on such motion for new trial on Crim. R. 33(A)(2) and (3) grounds if no affidavits are submitted with the motion.”); City of Dayton v. Moser, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 16773, 1998 WL 598119, *1 (Sept. 11, 1998) (noting that the absence of the affidavit required by Crim.R. 33(C) “is fatal to a motion for a new trial”).
{¶ 16} Even on the merits, Hiler’s claim about prosecutorial misconduct and the allegedly withheld criminal record would not entitle him to a new trial. “Failure to disclose the criminal record of a witness does not automatically warrant a new trial.” State v. Wogenstahl, 2004-Ohio-5994, 970 N.E.2d 447, ¶ 27 (1st Dist.). In such a case, a defendant must establish a reasonable probability that the result would have been different if the evidence had been disclosed. State v. Kitzler, 8th Dist.

He argues that the first trial judge abused her discretion when she agreed to delay impaneling that jury. He also argues that the second trial judge abused his discretion when he quashed the first jury without a sound reason for doing so and without considering reasonable alternatives.  Finally, he argues that the State engaged in misconduct when it raised unsupported claims of judicial bias and secured the first jury’s dismissal.
{¶18} Haywood argues that the State engaged in misconduct by essentially goading the trial court into declaring a mistrial and quashing the first jury. He argues that the bias claims the
State raised were meritless and were asserted strictly to avoid trying the case before a jury it found unfavorable. On a related note, he argues that the second trial judge abused his discretion when he quashed the first jury based on the State’s meritless allegations. He asserts that the court failed to undertake a sound reasoning process or to consider reasonable alternatives such as reconfirming the jury in question or replacing Juror 18 with an alternate juror. 
{¶61} In his seventh assignment of error, Haywood argues that prosecutorial misconduct deprived him of a fair trial.
{¶63} Haywood alleges two instances of prosecutorial misconduct. First, he argues that the prosecutor engaged in misconduct when he repeatedly relied on Haywood’s post-Miranda silence to attack his credibility. Second, he argues that he was denied a fair trial because “this record demonstrates that the final-trial jury observed many indications that there had been previous official proceedings, if not previous trials.”",Did not reach error/conduct did not result in prejudice,"{¶21} The record does not support Haywood’s assertion that the State’s actions amounted to an attempt to manipulate the proceedings. Regardless of whether the first trial judge was actually biased, the conduct underlying the State’s allegations against her is a matter of record. There is no evidence that the State accused the first trial judge of conduct that she did not, in fact, commit. Nor is there evidence that the State’s actions amounted to tactical scheming. For instance, the State did not seek repeated continuances, wait until the trial had progressed to seek the judge’s removal, file and dismiss one or more affidavits of disqualification, or change its position once the first trial judge recused herself. The State requested a single, brief continuance at the conclusion of voir dire, filed its affidavit of disqualification the very next day, and pursued the matter with the second trial judge after the first judge’s recusal. The State’s actions, in and of themselves, do not warrant a finding of misconduct. Accordingly, we must conclude that Haywood’s prosecutorial misconduct argument lacks merit.
{¶64} There is no evidence in the record that the jury here learned about Haywood’s prior trial as a result of any misconduct on the part of the State. It is undisputed that Haywood had more than one trial in this matter and that the majority of the witnesses who testified against him testified at his prior trial. The question of how to refer to his prior trial was an issue that the trial court raised before opening statements. When the court proposed referring to the earlier trial as a hearing that occurred under oath, defense counsel responded that it was “significant,” for purposes of impeachment, to be able to stress to the jury that certain witnesses had potentially
“lie[d] in front of a judge and a jury under oath * * *.” Defense counsel then objected when the court ruled that the first trial should be called a prior hearing under oath rather than a trial.
Moreover, defense counsel (1) was the first to broach the subject of the prior trial in opening statements, noting that one of the witnesses had “given testimony under oath in a prior hearing”; (2) was the first to ask a witness about the prior proceedings on cross-examination, inquiring whether the witness recalled having “testified in this case already” under oath; and (3) repeatedly relied on testimony given at the first trial as an impeachment tool on cross-examination. Haywood has not shown that the jury learned of his prior trial as a result of prosecutorial misconduct. Further, given defense counsel’s actions in the court below, Haywood cannot now argue that any references the State made to the prior proceeding in this matter deprived him of a fair trial. We reject Haywood’s argument to the contrary. 
{¶65} Next, we address Haywood’s contention that the prosecutor improperly commented on his right to remain silent. Haywood testified in his own defense at trial. It was
his testimony that he was present at R.R.’s apartment when the murders occurred, but that it was Brantley who committed the murders. While testifying, he admitted that he had an interview
with the police a few days after the murders and repeatedly lied and provided the detectives with false leads. He testified that he did not go to the police right after the murders because he was scared and “thinking [he would] get in trouble just for being there * * *.” He also testified that he misled the police during his interview because he was afraid how Brantley might react if he thought he had cooperated. 
{¶67} Even assuming that, at some point, the State’s questions or argument went beyond proper impeachment and amounted to improper comment on Haywood’s right to remain silent,
the record reflects that the prosecutor’s improper argument constituted harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt. See State v. Powell, 132 Ohio St.3d 233, 2012-Ohio-2577, ¶ 162. Haywood was convicted as an accomplice, not the principal offender, and, by his own testimony, he was with Brantley at R.R.’s apartment when the victims were murdered. Although he claimed that he was merely present at the apartment and not directly involved in the crimes that occurred there, the State produced a significant amount of circumstantial evidence to the contrary. The State produced evidence that the apartment had been ransacked and that Haywood’s thumbprint was
on one of the items strewn about the kitchen counter. The State also produced evidence that, at the estimated time of the murders, Haywood received text messages from Brantley reading: “kill both these n**gas” and “I’m bout to shoot Dutch go get da s*** and then I’m gonna kill both des n**gas but u got to hurry up so we can get up out of here.” Having carefully reviewed the record and all of the evidence in this matter, we cannot conclude that Haywood was materially prejudiced by the prosecutor’s misconduct, if any, as there was overwhelming evidence of his guilt. See, e.g., State v. Dalton, 9th Dist. Summit No. 17659, 1996 Ohio App. LEXIS 5124, *17

Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), and, thus, he could not have knowingly and intelligently entered his guilty plea. Appellant claimed that the state failed to disclose the existence of text messages between Officer Ellenwood and the victim. Appellant argued that the text messages contain evidence of an inappropriate, intimate relationship between Officer Ellenwood and the victim. Appellant asserted that the officer’s conduct undermines his credibility as a witness, as well as the credibility of the information that he obtained from the victim. Appellant contended that the officer likely used the relationship “to dissuade [the victim] from recanting her accusations.” Appellant thus argued that the evidence concerning Officer Ellenwood’s conduct would have allowed him to impeach the officer at trial and that the evidence constituted material evidence under Brady. Appellant argued that the state’s failure to disclose the evidence concerning Officer Ellenwood entitled him to withdraw his guilty plea and have his sentence vacated. ",No error,"{¶ 28} The court determined that “impeachment information is special * * * not in respect to whether a plea is voluntary (‘knowing,’ ‘intelligent,’ and ‘sufficient[ly] aware’),” but instead, “in relation to the fairness of a trial.” Id.

The court agreed that “the more information the defendant has, the more aware he is of the likely consequences of a plea, waiver, or decision, and the wiser that decision will be.” Id.

Callahan stating that they would have found this question to be prejudicial. 
Defendant was convicted of murdering Brandon Smith. In the course of the trial the prosecutor asked inflammatory questions of an expert witness. Prosecution had previously objected to defense’s questioning which led to a sidebar and casual agreement about the types of questions they would be asking. This likely played a role in why the defense permitted a few inflammatory questions before objecting to an especially inflammatory question about how difficult it is for the type of gun to go off accidentally.

Hall,,2015,Robbery/theft,Burglary,,,,Male,4 years prison term and 3 years of post-release control.,,2015,"Summation,Jury selection","{¶25} In his second assignment of error, Hall claims that the state violated his constitutional rights during rebuttal closing argument by: (1) referring to evidence not in the record; (2) remarking on the credibility of witnesses; (3) commenting on Hall’s decision not to testify; and (4) disparaging defense counsel.

{¶35} In his third assignment of error, Hall contends that the court incorrectly permitted the state to use a peremptory challenge on an African American juror. He argues that the court failed to correctly apply the required three-step adjudicatory process for a Batson claim. We disagree. ",Harmless error,"Evidence not in record: {¶29} Contrary to Hall’s claim, the prosecutor’s statement is factually supported by the record. Officer Parr, the police officer who first stopped the van driven by Hall and occupied by White, testified that items were seized from the van that later were determined to belong to Douglas. Officer Parr further testified that he pulled the same van over at around 2:00 on October 23, 2014, at which time the van was occupied by Hall and White and contained more of Douglas’ stolen belongings. Accordingly, the prosecutor’s remarks do not extend beyond the record. To the extent that Hall objects to the prosecutor’s use of the word “shocker,” he did not object to the use of the term at trial or raise plain error on appeal. Thus, we will not consider whether that remark constitutes prosecutorial misconduct. 

Credibility of witnesses: {¶30} Hall also argues that the prosecutor improperly expressed an opinion as to the credibility of witnesses when the prosecutor (1) told the jury that Kerns was competent and that she “told [the jury] the truth,” and (2) stated that White’s testimony was “a lie” and that his “story is ridiculous.” However improper the prosecutor’s comments about the credibility of witnesses might have been, neither Hall nor White objected to them during rebuttal closing argument. Hall’s failure to object at trial forfeits the issue on appeal except for plain error review. State v. Andrews, 9th Dist. Summit No. 25114, 2010-Ohio-6126, ¶ 35. Hall has not raised plain error on appeal, however. “[T]his [C]ourt will not sua sponte undertake a plain-error analysis if a defendant fails to do so.” Cross, 2011-Ohio-3250, at ¶ 41. Thus, we will not construct a plain error argument on Hall’s behalf. 

Commenting on silence: {¶31}... The trial court found that the comment did not pertain to Hall’s exercise of his constitutional rights, but rather was the prosecutor’s argument regarding the weight of the evidence taking into account that the defense was based almost exclusively on the allegation that Kerns gave Hall and White permission to enter Douglas’ residence. We conclude that the trial court was correct. Having reviewed the record in its entirety, we find no basis to construe the prosecutor’s
statements as a reference to Hall’s exercise of his constitutional right to refrain from testifying. 

Disparaging defense: ¶33} Even if the prosecutor’s statement about the role of counsel in seeking justice was improper, Hall has not established that, but for the prosecutor’s remarks, the jury would not have
convicted him. See State v. Johnson, 46 Ohio St.3d 96, 102 (1989). The trial court struck the statement from the record and informed the jury that all officers of the court are responsible for seeking justice. The trial court then instructed the jury that the prosecutor’s stricken statement, and any statement made in closing argument, could not be considered evidence. Moreover, as discussed, there was ample evidence that Hall and White entered Douglas’ residence without permission through a broken window and stole Douglas’ belongings. Reviewing the record in its entirety, we cannot conclude that the prosecutor’s improper remark regarding the roles of counsel in seeking justice prejudiced Hall’s right to a fair trial. 

Batson: {¶37} Here, the court found that Hall failed to make a prima-facie case of discrimination. Of three potential African American jurors who could have been seated on the jury panel, only one was the subject of a peremptory challenge. Another eventually became a panel member. It appears that the third “self-excused himself” but, according to the trial judge, “would [otherwise] have been on the panel or an alternate.” Under the circumstances, the court found that there had not been any pattern of race-based challenges. Thus, the court concluded that Hall failed to articulate a prima facie case of race-based discrimination. Under these facts, we cannot find that the trial court’s finding was clearly erroneous. {¶38} Moreover, the trial court further found that the State gave a valid, racially-neutral reason for striking the juror. The prosecution explained that it dismissed several individuals based on the fact that they worked in a social services or “helping profession” that might predispose them to sympathy for the defendants. The court observed that the prosecution had dismissed “a social worker” who was not African American and a “Head Start early daycare worker” who also was not African American. The juror who was the subject of the Batson challenge also worked at Head Start. Accordingly, the court found that “the [p]rosecution articulated a reasonable basis for * * * challenging this juror” that the prosecution “consistently * * * followed” throughout voir dire. The court further observed that the prosecution was not required to “demonstrate a for-cause [challenge].” Indeed, the trial court was correct that a peremptory challenge on a juror does not have to “’rise to the level justifying exercise of a challenge for cause.’” State v. Frazier, 115 Ohio St.3d 139, 2007-Ohio-5048, ¶ 97, quoting Batson, 476 U.S. at 97. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in determining that the State articulated a racially valid neutral reason for exercising a peremptory challenge. ","prosecutorial misconduct,Batson v.

Appellant was denied a fair trial due to prosecutorial misconduct by the
assistant prosecutors.

{¶57} Appellant also claims he was denied a fair trial by the state repeatedly asking questions that sought to elicit impermissible evidence...

{¶59} Appellant complains the state also impermissibly attacked his expert witnesses on cross-examination. 

{¶61} Another example complained of by appellant was whether the second expert would doubt the disclosure of the victims because there was no medical evidence. 

¶62} Appellant also complains that the prosecutor, during closing arguments, impermissibly intruded on his right to remain silent by talking about what would have happened if the victims’ clothing was tested and his DNA was found

{¶66} Appellant also claims the prosecutor committed misconduct during closing arguments by suggesting the defense expert witnesses were there for remuneration...",Harmless error,"{¶57}... During the trial, the state did ask certain questions that appeared to seek inadmissible evidence. For example, during the questioning of the victims’ teacher, appellant asserts that the state asked the teacher to recount specifically what the girls said. Later, during the testimony of the
DNA expert, Laura Evans, the state asked questions of the DNA expert to elicit conclusions that could not be drawn about whether her findings were consistent with sexual assault or not. In these instances, and others throughout trial, appellant’s counsel objected and the objections were sustained. Appellant does not offer any evidence about prejudice or how these questions to which no answers were given denied him of a fair
trial. 

{¶59}... A reading of the transcript reveals pointed and repeated questioning of the defense expert witnesses that could be classified as aggressive and combative. However, nothing indicates the prosecutor’s questions strayed from objectionable to misconduct. Again, improper questions were objected to by appellant’s counsel and those objections were sustained. 

{¶61}...The expert had already answered the question, that she would not, and that sexual assault may occur even though no signs of trauma exist. Appellant’s attorney objected because the question was previously asked and answered. The objection was sustained. While repeating questions that have been previously answered is objectionable, it does not indicate misconduct that would deny appellant of a fair trial. 

{¶64} During appellant’s closing arguments, his attorney commented on the lack of any DNA evidence and the fact that the twins’ outer clothing was not tested for DNA. The statement appellant asserts was improper was made in response to a statement made during appellant’s closing argument that questioned why the outer clothing of the children was not tested for DNA. {¶65} During trial, the DNA expert explained that she did not test this clothing because the results would not have been probative. From the brief history of the case she had, she understood that the alleged perpetrator was around the girls a significant amount of time. If his DNA was found on their outer clothing, it would not contribute to an understanding of whether appellant committed the acts for which he was charged. The state, during its second closing argument, highlighted that fact and that testimony. The state did not impermissibly comment on appellant’s right to remain silent as alleged in this appeal.

{¶66}...Appellant alleges that this is an improper attack, but points to no case law to support that proposition. The prosecutor asked each defense expert witness about their hourly rate and the compensation they expected from this case. The state was commenting on  testimony that existed in the record. 

The state did not commit misconduct such that appellant was deprived of a fair trial. A reading of the transcript reveals only minor issues that were objected to by appellant’s counsel and corrected by the trial court.

See Powell, supra. We note that while “the state may use a criminal defendant’s pre-arrest silence to impeach his credibility” State v. Bajaj, 7th Dist. No. 13 CO 16, 2005-Ohio-2931, ¶ 98, citing Jenkins v. Anderson, 447 U.S. 231, 100 S.Ct. 2124, 65 L.Ed.2d 86 (1980), this exception does not apply, here, as Appellant did not testify. Hence, the state’s comments in this matter are clearly improper. That said, violations of a defendant’s constitutional right against selfincrimination are subject to a harmless error review.

First, he argues that the trial court erred in allowing the State to call rebuttal witnesses who had not been disclosed to defense counsel prior to the commencement of the trial. He asserts that the State was aware that he was going to testify and, therefore, was aware of the possibility that Howton could comment on his character, which would ‘open the door’ to the admission of character evidence on rebuttal. Thus, Howton argues the fact that these witnesses could have been called for rebuttal was foreseeable and that the prosecutor, therefore, had a duty under Crim.R. 16 to disclose these witnesses prior to trial. Second, Howton here argues that the trial court also erred in allowing extrinsic evidence of other bad acts to be presented at trial through the State’s rebuttal witnesses. On the basis of these arguments, Howton requests that this court vacate his convictions and order a new trial. We will address these two arguments in the order presented in Howton’s brief.""",No error,"{¶24} After examining the record, we do not find any evidence that the prosecutor had a duty under Crim.R. 16(I) to disclose the names of the rebuttal witnesses because the State did not reasonably anticipate that it was likely that SS and AH would be called to testify on rebuttal.
{¶32} ""With these statements, Howton defended himself by arguing that the accusations against him were inconsistent with his character. His statements represent himself as a peaceful person that is not disposed to violent behavior. Id. at 593-594, 596-597, 610. The first two statements put his character at issue in regard to the offenses of kidnapping and felonious assault. The third statement put his allegations of his good character forward as a reason to believe that he did not commit the crime of rape. Id. In so doing, he made his character an issue in this trial and ‘opened the door’ for the prosecution to rebut these assertions with evidence showing that his character did not conform to his representations at trial.

appropriate and stated basic facts that constituted the charged offenses which were confirmed by witnesses testifying during its case in chief. 
{¶11} In his second of six assignments of error, Lyons asserts:

Hussein,,2013,rape,Rape,,,,,,,2013,"Jury selection,Other or unknown","{¶ 15} Appellant first argues that the prosecutor improperly shifted the burden of proof during voir dire and again in closing arguments. Specifically, in voir dire, the prosecutor asked a potential juror if she was okay with giving the defendant the presumption of innocence. The prosecutor then commented ""that's a presumption that can be rebutted, and, obviously, the State believes that it will be rebutted by evidence that's presented to you."" (Tr. Vol. 1 at 45.) Appellant did not object to this alleged instance of prosecutorial misconduct and has, therefore, waived all but plain error. State v. Daniels, 10th Dist. No. 14AP-326, 2015-Ohio-2649, ¶ 29, citing State v. Cunningham, 105 Ohio St.3d 197, 2004-Ohio-7007, ¶ 82. To prevail on plain error review, appellant must establish both that misconduct occurred and that but for the misconduct, the
outcome of the trial clearly would have been otherwise. State v. Pickens, 141 Ohio St.3d 462, 2014-Ohio-5445, ¶ 109. 
{¶ 17} Next, during the state's closing argument, the prosecutor noted that appellant testified that he never talked to J.R. on the phone during a certain time period, notwithstanding phone records indicating that his cell phone placed calls to her phone number during the same period. (Tr. Vol. 4 at 662-64.) The prosecutor then commented ""What? Did somebody else have your phone?"" (Tr. Vol. 4 at 718.) The trial court overruled appellant's objection to that comment. Appellant argues that this comment could have led the jury to believe that it was his burden to prove that he did not talk to
J.R. on the phone. We review a prosecutor's closing argument in its entirety to determine whether the allegedly improper remarks were prejudicial. State v. Were, 118 Ohio St.3d
448, 2008-Ohio-2762, ¶ 198. Whether this comment was proper or not, we cannot say that it was prejudicial and denied appellant a fair trial in the context of the entire closing
argument. Further, right after the comment, the trial court noted that it was the state's burden to prove guilt and that the state could not shift the burden to the appellant. Pickens at ¶ 120 (finding no prejudice in similar context where trial court instructions corrected any potential error). The trial court also fully and correctly instructed the jury on the state's burden to prove appellant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and that if it 
did not meet this burden, appellant must be acquitted. State v. Carter, 3d Dist. No. 1-15-62, 2017-Ohio-1233, ¶ 130. 
{¶ 18} Last, appellant argues that the prosecutor improperly argued to the jury that he admitted to committing the offenses when, in fact, he denied the offenses in his trial testimony. Again, we disagree. Courts afford prosecutors wide latitude in closing arguments, and prosecutors may draw reasonable inferences from the evidence at trial, commenting on those inferences during closing argument. State v. Lipkins, 10th Dist. No. 16AP-616, 2017-Ohio-4085, ¶ 23; State v. Hunt, 10th Dist. No. 12AP-1037, 2013-Ohio5326, ¶ 18. Although appellant denied committing these offenses in his trial testimony,
the state admitted into evidence text messages that appellant sent to the victim's mother which can be read as admissions that he sexually abused Y.C. The victim's mother also testified that she talked to appellant on the phone and he admitted to the sexual abuse of Y.C. (Tr. Vol 1 at 234.) The prosecutor's comment was, at the least, a reasonable inference that can be drawn from that evidence and was, therefore, proper. ",Harmless error,"{¶ 16} Regardless of the level of our review, this comment was a proper and correct statement of law. A defendant in a criminal trial is presumed to be innocent and that presumption may be overcome if the state offers proof beyond a reasonable doubt of a defendant's guilt. That is one of the concepts that underlie our system of criminal law and which the prosecutor addressed in her comment. 
{¶ 17} Next, during the state's closing argument, the prosecutor noted that appellant testified that he never talked to J.R. on the phone during a certain time period, notwithstanding phone records indicating that his cell phone placed calls to her phone number during the same period. (Tr. Vol. 4 at 662-64.) The prosecutor then commented ""What? Did somebody else have your phone?"" (Tr. Vol. 4 at 718.) The trial court overruled appellant's objection to that comment. Appellant argues that this comment could have led the jury to believe that it was his burden to prove that he did not talk to J.R. on the phone. We review a prosecutor's closing argument in its entirety to determine whether the allegedly improper remarks were prejudicial. State v. Were, 118 Ohio St.3d 448, 2008-Ohio-2762, ¶ 198. Whether this comment was proper or not, we cannot say that it was prejudicial and denied appellant a fair trial in the context of the entire closing argument. Further, right after the comment, the trial court noted that it was the state's burden to prove guilt and that the state could not shift the burden to the appellant. Pickens at ¶ 120 (finding no prejudice in similar context where trial court instructions corrected any potential error). The trial court also fully and correctly instructed the jury on the state's burden to prove appellant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and that if it did not meet this burden, appellant must be acquitted.

Arega,,2012,rape,Rape,,,,,9 years,,2012,"Brady violation,Other or unknown","{¶ 7} Appellant argues in his sole assignment of error that the trial court erred when it denied his motion for resentencing because the trial court relied in part on a fabricated and false statement of material fact at the sentencing hearing and his sentence was contrary to law. Appellant spends much of his brief arguing the assistant prosecuting attorney committed fraud on the court in his original trial, and the trial court used the false information in sentencing him to more than the minimum sentence. Appellant argues that, although the prosecutor contended the victim's description of what happened was consistent with rape, the prosecutor failed to disclose the sexual assault nurse exam notes, which would have revealed the victim's description did not describe rape. ",Did not reach error/conduct did not result in prejudice,"{¶ 9} We first note appellant failed to raise any argument in his motion for leave to resentence with regard to the prosecutor's alleged fraud on the court; the state's failure to produce discoverable materials, pursuant to Crim.R. 16; the jury's request to see the detective's interview with the victim; the trial court's failure to clarify the definition of ""force"" for the jury; and the trial court's improper allowance of chemical testing results regarding the presence of semen. A party who fails to raise an argument in the trial court waives the right to raise it on appeal. Harding Pointe, Inc. v. Ohio Dept. of Job & Family Servs., 10th Dist. No. 13AP-258, 2013-Ohio-4885, ¶ 43, citing Betz v. Penske Truck Leasing Co., L.P., 10th Dist. No. 11AP-982, 2012-Ohio-3472, ¶ 34. ""A fundamental rule of

Ohio Dept. of Job & Family Servs., 10th Dist. No. 12AP-709, 2013- Ohio-2742, ¶ 13. Thus, appellant has waived these arguments. 
{¶ 13} Therefore, as we explained in McCualsky, because a motion for reconsideration of a final order is a nullity, and all orders from said motion are also a nullity and not subject to appeal, the trial court's January 23, 2017 entry denying appellant's motion for leave to resentence in the present case is not a final, appealable order. Because the entry was not a final, appealable order, this court is without jurisdiction in this appeal, and we must dismiss the appeal.
{¶ 14} Accordingly, we dismiss appellant's appeal, and appellant's single assignment of error is rendered moot.",Crim.R. 16,,Susan Diane Brown,,"William A. Klatt,Timothy S.

I. The trial court violated appellant’s rights under the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution of the United States by allowing the state to present evidence of statements elicited from appellant by police officers after he was accused of rape and while he was being detained by police officers without first advising him of his constitutional rights and obtaining a valid waiver from him.",No error,"{¶22} In his first assignment of error, Carter contends that the trial court violated his constitutional rights by allowing the state to introduce evidence of statements he made to the police at the scene of the incident. Carter, however, did not raise this issue in the trial court.  It is well established that if a motion is not filed raising a particular suppression issue, that issue is waived. See, e.g., Xenia v. Wallace, 37 Ohio St.3d 216, 524 N.E.2d 889 (1988), paragraph one of the syllabus; State v. Mixner, 12th Dist. Warren No. CA2001-07-074, 2002-Ohio-180, ¶ 3. Regardless of the fact that Carter waived the issue by failing to raise it in the trial court, there is no merit to his claim. Officer Moze, who questioned Carter at the scene, testified that at the time he questioned him he was not under arrest; rather, his questioning was for investigative purposes so that he could determine what had transpired. See State v. Gaston, 110 Ohio App.3d 835, 842, 675 N.E.2d 526 (11th Dist.1996). The first assignment of error is overruled. ",harmless error,,Larry A. Jones Sr.,,"Eileen A. Gallagher,Melody J.

trial due to prosecutorial misconduct. We disagree.
{¶38} The test for prosecutorial misconduct is whether the prosecutor's remarks and comments were improper and if so, whether those remarks and comments prejudicially affected the substantial rights of the accused. State v. Lott, 51 Ohio St.3d 160, 555 N.E .2d 293 (1990), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 1017, 111 S.Ct. 591, 112 L.Ed .2d 596 (1990). In reviewing allegations of prosecutorial misconduct, we must review the complained-of conduct in the context of the entire trial. Darden v. Wainwright, 477 U.S. 168, 106 S.Ct. 2464, 91 L.Ed.2d 144 (1986). Prosecutorial misconduct will not provide a basis for reversal unless the misconduct can be said to have deprived appellant of a fair trial based on the entire record. Lott, supra, 51 Ohio St.3d at 166. ",No error,"{¶42} We find the statement above a fair comment on the evidence. The
prosecutor’s statement is not improper because he did not shift the burden of proof to appellant, and this statement did not deprive appellant of a fair trial. Moreover, appellant cannot demonstrate, even assuming arguendo the cited statement was improper, “but for” the statement he would not have been convicted of robbery.
{¶43} Appellant was not denied a fair trial due to prosecutorial misconduct. His second assignment of error is overruled. ",prosecutorial misconduct,,Patricia A. Delaney,,"John W. Wise,Craig R.

Brown,Black,2016,Robbery/theft,aggravated robbery,"tampering with evidence, having a weapon while under disability",,,,7 years,,2016,Brady violation,"{¶ 33} In his third and final assignment of error, Brown argues the trial court erred in denying his motion for new trial. Though Brown filed his motion in the trial court presenting an argument pursuant to Crim.R. 33, the trial court analyzed his motion pursuant to R.C. 2945.79. In the interest of thoroughness, we address both grounds

{¶ 37} Brown moved for a new trial on the basis of newly discovered evidence, alleging he had discovered material impeachment evidence that Moxley had a conviction for receiving stolen property and the state did not disclose Moxley's conviction prior to trial.

{¶ 40} Though Brown purportedly filed his motion for new trial pursuant to
Crim.R. 33(A)(6), it is unclear whether he also presented an argument for a new trial based on R.C. 2945.79 and Brady v. Maryland",Did not reach error/conduct did not result in prejudice,"{¶ 39} The state asserts the trial court did not abuse its discretion because Brown fails to demonstrate the evidence of Moxley's criminal record is something that could not
have been discovered prior to trial with the exercise of reasonable diligence. We agree.
The state gave Brown the option of running a complete records check and Brown declined. Moreover, though we agree with Brown that the state was in error by not running the records check in the first instance pursuant to Brown's discovery request, we nonetheless find the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Brown's motion for new trial because the evidence of Moxley's criminal record would not disclose a strong probability that the outcome will change. There was ample evidence at trial that Brown committed the offenses.


{¶ 44} Here, we agree with the trial court that the evidence related to Moxley's criminal record is not material to either Brown's guilt or punishment. Additionally, given the number of witnesses besides Moxley who testified regarding their firsthand accounts of Brown at or near the scene, the gunshot residue on Brown's hands, and Brown's
polygraph test results, we agree with the trial court that impeaching Moxley's testimony with his fifth-degree felony receiving stolen property conviction does not create a reasonable probability of a different result at trial. 
Even in the absence of the timely disclosure of the evidence related to Moxley's criminal record, we find Brown received a fair trial and that the verdict is worthy of confidence.",Brady v. Maryland,LUPER SCHUSTER,Betsy Luper Schuster,"DORRIAN J., concurs.

5. Record suggests an agreement existed between the State and Angela Gilliam
{¶56} Appellant contends the record suggests there was an agreement
between the state and Angela Gilliam. Appellant appears to be contending there was an agreement between the state and Angela Gilliam that if she testified favorably for the state her indictment would be dismissed.
{¶57} Due process provisions in both the United States and Ohio
Constitutions require the prosecuting attorney to disclose all evidence that is
“favorable” to the accused and “material” to issues of guilt or punishment. The United States Supreme Court has recognized Brady encompasses
evidence and information that may be used to impeach prosecution witnesses. Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150, 154–55, 92 S.Ct. 763 (1972) (Promises for favorable treatment and plea agreements must be disclosed.).
{¶58} Accordingly, if there was an agreement then it should have been
disclosed. However, the record before us does not indicate there was an agreement between Angela Gilliam and the state. ",No error,"{¶46} Considering the context in which the statements were made, the
prosecutor did not commit misconduct. His questioning and closing pointed out the holes in Appellant’s position that Angela Gilliam was mistaken when she claimed he was the owner of the clothes and safe. When read in context, the language used does not rise to a level of misconduct. 

58: However, the record before us does not indicate there was an agreement between Angela Gilliam and the state. Instead, the record indicates there was no agreement.

{¶59} Consequently, the record does not support Appellant’s claim that there
was an agreement between the state and Angela Gilliam.

{¶ 32} Reyes argues in his third assignment of error that the state engaged in
prosecutorial misconduct at the trial by asking him during cross-examination about his silence to police officers. ",No error,"{¶ 41} The record indicates that the state was cross-examining Reyes with
impeachment evidence that Reyes did not remain silent when questioned by police. Instead, Reyes made a prior inconsistent statement to police and did not assert that Lopez threatened him with a knife until his testimony at trial. Thus, the post-arrest and post-Miranda issue raised by Reyes is not applicable to the case at bar. There is no error, plain or otherwise, given that the state was within its right to impeach Reyes during cross-examination. Reyes'
third assignment of error is overruled. ",,PIPER,Robin N. Piper III,"S. POWELL, P., RINGLAND","Stephen W. Powell,Robert Ringland",Michael T. Gmoser,,,,Scott N.

Prosecutorial Misconduct
{¶ 81} Reserving appellant's third assignment of error for later discussion, we
next address appellant's fourth assignment of error. This asserts that prosecutorial misconduct denied appellant his right to a fair trial and due process of law under the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Ohio Constitution, Article I, Sections 10 and 16.

{¶ 83} The improper conduct cited by appellant concerns the prosecutor's
misinterpretation and reliance on a rarely invoked legal theory known as the ""doctrine of chances,"" telling the jury that under this theory they could conclude that cumulative testimony as to multiple criminal acts would be probative, on the basis of sheer probability, as to the occurrence of at least some of the acts

{¶ 87} Also in connection with the state's closing statement, appellant argues on appeal that the prosecution improperly expressed the belief that appellant had lied and that his defense witnesses had lied on the stand. ",Harmless error,"{¶ 85} We agree with appellant that the state both misstated the doctrine of chances and asked the jury to misapply it to the evidence

{¶ 86} Although the state clearly misstated and improperly applied the doctrine of chances here, under a plain error standard we can discern no grounds for reversal. The verdicts indicate that the jury rejected the invitation to blend testimony regarding one offense into its determination regarding another, and remained willing to consider each accuser's testimony on its own merits as each offense, reaching an independent conclusion on the various charges. There is no basis to conclude that, but for the state's comments in this respect, the outcome of the trial would clearly have differed. 

{¶ 92} Examining these improper statements by the prosecutor in light of the whole trial, and focusing on the fairness of that trial, we conclude that they did not prejudice appellant's substantial rights.

{¶ 94} In summary, reference to the doctrine of chances was improper in this case because the prosecutor incorrectly presented this doctrine as a call to consider cumulative propensity evidence as probative. We clarify that the doctrine does not operate in derogation of Ohio's well-established rules against the improper use of other-acts evidence. The evidence in question, however, was properly admitted to show motive, opportunity, intent, or a pattern of conduct. The prosecution's language verged on the
excessive but did not cross the line with reference to the use of terms ""prey,"" ""tinfoil hats,"" and ""grassy knoll shooter,"" and we do not find error in this particular terminology.
Finally, if at least three of the prosecution's remarks concerning veracity of witness testimony were improper, we find no impairment of appellant's substantial rights, given the volume of evidence presented on the various points and the jury's rejection of much of the testimony that was allegedly bolstered by the prosecution's remarks. Appellant's fourth assignment of error is overruled. ",prosecutorial misconduct,Klatt,William A. Klatt,"SADLER, J, TYACK, P.J., dissents","Lisa L. Sadler,G.

Criminal trials in Ohio are supposed to be proceedings which fairly determine if a person has violated a provision of the Ohio Revised Code.
