Groce,Black,2016,Drugs,engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity,"possession of cocaine, illegal manufacture of drugs, trafficking in cocaine, along with firearm specifications",,,,36 years,,2016,Summation,"{¶ 55} In his fourth assignment of error, Groce argues the prosecutor made several
remarks during the state's closing argument that deprived Groce of his right to a fair trial.
More specifically, Groce challenges as improper and prejudicial the prosecutor's statements
(1) that represented the surveillance video equipment to be motion activated; (2) expanded
the scope of the engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity charge to events beyond the
predicate offenses listed in the indictment; and (3) urged the jury to consider the
photographs of Brandon's tattoo for an impermissible purpose.",Did not reach error/conduct did not result in prejudice,"{¶ 60} Even if the prosecutor was technically incorrect about whether the cameras
were motion activated, the point he was making was consistent with the testimony.
Moreover, defense counsel objected to this statement at trial and the trial court instructed
the jurors to rely on their own memories of what the evidence showed. Thus, Groce does
not demonstrate that this characterization of the evidence during closing arguments
prejudiced him or deprived him of a fair trial.

{¶ 61} Groce next argues the state deprived him of a fair trial when, during its
rebuttal argument, the prosecutor commented that as of March 29, 2016, the drug house
had all of the items it would need to engage in a pattern of corrupt activity and that it was
""an ongoing place of business."" (Tr. Vol. IV at 966.) Defense counsel objected that the state was attempting to expand the predicate offenses to the charge of engaging in a pattern of
corrupt activity beyond the one day contained in the indictment. This argument relates
solely to the fairness of the trial as it relates to Groce's conviction for engaging in a pattern
of corrupt activity. Having determined in our resolution of Groce's first assignment of error
that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction of engaging in a pattern of
corrupt activity, this argument is moot and we need not address it.

{¶ 64} Because Groce does not show that the state deprived him of a fair trial when
the prosecutor commented on the motion-activated nature of the surveillance footage or
when the prosecutor commented on Brandon's tattoos, and because Groce's argument
about the evidence related to the engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity charge is moot,
Groce's fourth assignment of error is overruled in part and moot in part.",Other,,LUPER SCHUSTER,Betsy Luper Schuster,"BROWN and DORRIAN, JJ","Susan Diane Brown,Julia L.

conduct to recharge him and obtain an illegal conviction by circumventing and manipulating the process. However, Knox does not level any specific allegation of prosecutorial misconduct. He appears to assert an argument similar to the one he raises regarding double jeopardy. Knox cites to 
Berger v. United States, 295 U.S. 78, 88, 55 S.Ct. 629, 79 L.Ed. 1314 (1935), to support his claim. Knox further claims that the conduct was
so egregious that it rendered the entire trial fundamentally unfair. But again, he does not allege any specific violation. ",No error,"¶ 29 Knox cites to Berger v. United States, 295 U.S. 78, 88, 55 S.Ct. 629,
79 L.Ed. 1314 (1935), to support his claim. Knox further claims that the conduct was so egregious that it rendered the entire trial fundamentally unfair. But again, he does not allege any specific violation. Knox cites to Berger for the simple proposition that “[i]t is as much the duty of the United States Attorney to refrain from improper methods calculated to produce a wrongful conviction as it is to use every legitimate means to bring about a just one.” Id. at paragraph six of the syllabus. Similar to the double jeopardy argument, Knox has not established a colorable claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.

¶ 30 In Knox’s discussion of judicial misconduct, discussed below, he also
asserts that the trial judge and the prosecutor conspired against him. Knox appears to claim that there exists a prior indictment that was dismissed without prejudice, but does not cite to anywhere in the record to establish this claim. In an attachment to the application, Knox indicates that a previous case, “case number 17-0556,” was dismissed without prejudice. However, Knox does not properly identify this case and the number does not appear to be a Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court case number. Knox’s reliance on matters that are not contained within the appellate record may not form the basis for reopening. Stefan, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 104979, 2018-Ohio-3493, at ¶ 6. 

¶ 31 He further asserts that because of this dismissed case, the state was
required to produce newly discovered evidence in order to reindict him. “A nolle prosequi is merely a withdrawal of the indictment, which if done before jeopardy has attached, does not prohibit reindictment.” State v. Dixon, 14 Ohio App.3d 396, 397, 471 N.E.2d 864 (8th Dist.1984), citing State v. Eberhardt, 56 Ohio App. 2d 193, 381 N.E.2d 1357 (8th Dist.1978).

French,Sarr,Samba,Samba Sarr,Black,2018,Sexual violence,Kidnapping,gross sexual imposition and assault,,,,4.5 years,,2018,Summation,"{¶ 19} The sole issue before us relates to whether counsel improperly failed to object to alleged prosecutorial misconduct during closing argument.

{¶ 21} The specific portion of the prosecutor’s argument to which Sarr objects occurred during rebuttal closing argument wherein the prosecutor stated, “Don’t be afraid to go back into that room and do your job and find this man guilty.” Tr. 472. Sarr argues that this statement indicated to the jurors that their only option following deliberation was to convict on all charges. ",Did not reach error/conduct did not result in prejudice,"{¶ 24} We agree that the prosecutor could have been more artful and instead said something along the lines of “don’t be afraid to go back into that room and do your job. And when you do, the evidence supports a finding of guilty.” However, we cannot conclude that an isolated sentence in a three-volume trial transcript deprived Sarr of a fair trial. We note the jury was properly instructed that closing arguments did not constitute
evidence. Further, the trial court properly instructed the jury on the reasonable doubt standard. It also instructed the jury that it could not convict Sarr unless the State produced evidence which convinced the jury, beyond a reasonable doubt, of every essential element of the charged offenses. Finally, the jury was instructed on the presumption of innocence. Thus, the jury was properly instructed on its duties, and we
presume it followed those instructions.

{¶ 25} Therefore, trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to object to this statement. It is entirely possible that counsel, like us, did not believe the statement affected the fairness of the trial. It is also possible that counsel, for strategic reasons, thought it better not to object and draw attention to the statement. In any event, given that we conclude Sarr has failed to demonstrate prosecutorial misconduct depriving him of a fair trial, we cannot say that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the contested comment. See State v. Gilliam, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 17491, 1999 WL 812335, *10 (Sept. 30, 1999) (“failure to make a meritless objection cannot be construed as ineffective assistance of counsel.”)",Resentencing,prosecutorial misconduct,TUCKER,Michael J.

prevented him from receiving a fair trial. Specifically, appellant contends that the state
committed prosecutorial misconduct when it elicited prejudicial, irrelevant information from
appellant, then during closing argument vouched for the victim’s credibility. 

{¶ 56} Second, appellant argues that during closing argument appellee improperlyvouched for the victim when the prosecutor referred to the defense as putting “blame on thevictim” or “blaming the survivor of this assault.” Appellant contends these comments deprivedhim of a fair trial and warrant a reversal of his conviction.",Did not reach error/conduct did not result in prejudice,"As we indicated above, in the present case the trial court properly concluded that
the evidence of appellant’s imprisonment had no probative value and the court properly
admonished appellee for eliciting that information. Importantly, the trial court also instructed
the jury to disregard this question and answer. Courts must presume that juries follow a court's
instructions, including instructions to disregard the testimony. State v. Treesh, 90 Ohio St.3d
460, 480, 739 N.E.2d 749 (2001); State v. Loza, 71 Ohio St.3d 61, 75, 641 N.E.2d 1082 (1994);
State v. Zuern, 32 Ohio St.3d 56, 61, 512 N.E.2d 585 (1987). Further, because the trial court
sustained defense counsel’s objection, the court prohibited the prosecutor’s further pursuit of this
issue. Here, in light of the context of the prosecutor's question and the court’s curative
instruction, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion and the prosecutor’s
conduct did not deprive appellant of a fair trial. See State v. Marr, 2d Dist. Montgomery
No.28604, 2020-Ohio-3898 (prosecutor’s eliciting testimony about defendant previously being
imprisoned and then reminding the jury of it during closing argument did not affect outcome). 

{¶ 58} In the case sub judice, the trial court appropriately instructed the jury that openingstatements and closing statements are not evidence. Further, as noted above, the Supreme Courtof Ohio has determined that the prosecution “ * * * is entitled to a certain degree of latitude insummation, * * *.” State v. Lott, 51 Ohio St.3d 160, 165, 555 N.E.2d 293 (1990), citing State v.Liberatore, 69 Ohio St.2d 583, 589, 433 N.E.2d 561 (1982). By referring to J.L. as a victim or asurvivor of sexual assault, as in Thacker, no improper vouching occurred because the prosecutordid not express personal belief about the victim's credibility. Rather, the prosecutor respondedto defense counsel's attacks on the victim's credibility by commenting on her determination inpursuing the charges and her lack of motive to fabricate them. Thacker, supra, at ¶ 81; see Statev. Davis, 116 Ohio St.3d 404, 2008-Ohio-2, 880 N.E.2d 31, ¶ 241 (No improper vouchingoccurred in closing rebuttal because the prosecutor did not express any personal belief about theexperts' credibility and “was simply responding to defense attacks by commenting on the experts'collective experience”).

appellant’s failure to testify violated appellant’s privilege against
self-incrimination guaranteed by the Fifth and Fourteenth
Amendments of the United States Constitution. 

{¶37} On appeal, Mr. Tawney again raises issue with the prosecutor’s “zero evidence” remark. He directs our attention to our recent decision in State v. Vaughn, 11th Dist. Ashtabula No. 2018-A-0045, 2019-Ohio-268, stating “the test for prosecutorial misconduct vis-a-vis a defendant’s failure to testify is ‘whether the language used was manifestly intended or was of such character that the jury would naturally and necessarily take it to be a comment on the failure of the accused to testify.’” Id., at ¶37
quoting Webb, supra. We do not find that “[h]e has zero evidence” would naturally and necessarily be taken by the jury as a comment on Mr. Tawney’s decision to not testify. ",No error,"{¶39} “[I]solated comments by a prosecutor are not to be taken out of context and given their most damaging meaning. * * * Counsel is entitled to latitude in closing arguments as to what the evidence has shown.” State v. Twyford, 94 Ohio St.3d 340, 2002-Ohio-894 (2002). Here, we find that the jury could have taken this statement as a
comment on the amount or nature of evidence, not directly on Mr. Tawney’s decision not to testify. Moreover, the court properly instructed the jury that the defendant did not have to testify or prove any element. Finally, we find the evidence was overwhelmingly against Mr. Tawney. Accordingly, we do not find that the prosecutor’s comment prejudicially affected Mr. Tawney’s substantial rights. 

{¶40} Mr. Tawney further asserts that even the prosecutor’s statement that the evidence was uncontroverted was not permitted pursuant to State v. Webb, 70 Ohio St.3d 325, 328 (1994), which states, “[a] prosecutor generally may note that his or her evidence is uncontradicted unless it is evidence only the defendant could contradict.” He argues that the victim’s testimony was the basis for all of the criminal charges and
provided the necessary elements to those charges, and that the only person who could contradict that testimony was Mr. Tawney. We disagree. Here, the state did not rely solely on the victim’s testimony but also introduced evidence from the investigating officer and hospital nurse. Moreover, according to the victim’s testimony, Mr. Tawney’s mother witnessed at least part of the assault, but defense counsel made the decision not to call her as a witness.

{¶41} Furthermore, “[a] reference by the prosecutor in closing argument to uncontradicted evidence is not a comment on the accused’s failure to testify, where the comment is directed to the strength of the state’s evidence and not to the silence of the accused, and where the jury is instructed * * * to not consider the accused’s failure to testify.” State v. Williams, 23 Ohio St.3d 16, 19-20 (1986). Viewing the prosecutor’s
statement in context, we find the comment was directed to the strength of the evidence not Mr. Tawney’s decision not to testify, and, as discussed above, the court properly instructed the jury. ",,prosecutorial misconduct,CYNTHIA WESTCOTT RICE,Cynthia Westcott Rice,"MATT LYNCH, J.,

knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily made because he claims the prosecution threatened to reindict him on more serious charges if he exercised his constitutional right to a jury trial. 

Appellant further argues that prosecutorial misconduct and
vindictive prosecution occurred and alleges the assistant prosecutor acted with animus to dissuade him from exercising his constitutional right to trial. ",No error,"Thus, as this court has recognized: “A prosecutor is permitted to use
the possibility of reindictment on more serious charges as an inducement in the plea bargain process,” and this is not a violation of due process. State v. Tolliver, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 108955, 2020-Ohio-3121, ¶ 29, citing State v. Staten, 7th Dist.
Mahoning No. 03 MA 187, 2005-Ohio-1350, ¶ 47. 

Therefore, the assistant prosecutor acted properly in using the possibility of reindictment on more serious charges to persuade appellant to accept the plea deal. Additionally, the circumstances herein do not establish prosecutorial misconduct or vindictive prosecution.
The record demonstrates that appellant’s pleas were knowingly,
intelligently, and voluntarily made. Accordingly, the fifth assignment of error is overruled. ",,prosecutorial misconduct,SEAN C. GALLAGHER,Sean C. Gallagher,"KATHLEEN ANN KEOUGH, J., and

The prosecution used its first peremptory challenge to dismiss Prospective Juror No. 5. The defense raised an objection. After the prosecution used its
second and third peremptory challenges, Prospective Juror No. 17 moved into the No. 9 spot. The prosecution then used its final peremptory challenge to excuse Prospective Juror No. 17",No error,"{¶ 36} We find both with regard to Prospective Juror No. 5 and Prospective Juror No. 17 that the prosecutor articulated race-neutral reasons for excusing those two prospective jurors.
{¶ 37} Regarding the third prong of Batson, we note that the crux of appellant's argument and thus our analysis focuses here. We have already determined that our analysis of the first prong of Batson was moot, and the state met the second prong of Batson.
Regarding the third prong, appellant argues the trial court erred, with respect to Prospective Juror No. 5 when: (1) it summarily overruled appellant's Batson challenge, (2) it simply accepted the state's rationale for the strike without meaningfully considering it, and (3) it combined steps two and three and denied the defense an opportunity to rebut the plausibility of the reasons submitted by the state. Appellant argues the trial court erred with respect to Prospective Juror No. 17 when it combined steps two and three by its summary denial which also precluded defense counsel from responding to the prosecutor's explanation. 

{¶ 42} On the record of this case, we cannot say appellant prevailed in his ultimate burden of persuasion regarding racial motivation and, thus, we cannot find the trial court's decisions to overrule appellant's Batson challenges were clearly erroneous.

Sterling, the Hamilton County Crime Lab drug analyst who tested and identified the substances recovered during Mr. Thompson’s arrest, to present expert testimony without providing an adequate pretrial expert report. 

{¶37} The key dispute in this case centers on whether the “Official Crime Laboratory Report” provided by the state satisfied Crim.R. 16(K). ",No error," Ms. Sterling’s report contains her opinions
classifying the recovered substances; it’s not just a recounting of her personal observations.
This case is also unlike Davis, where we found that an expert exceeded the scope of a toxicology report by testifying on the effects of a drug on driving ability. State v. Davis, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-190302, 2021-Ohio-1693, ¶ 74-75. Ms. Sterling’s testimony was limited to classifying the substances she analyzed, not the effect these substances have on a person who ingests them.

to Crim. R. 9. Appellant points out that at the time of the indictment, he was free on a posted surety bond in Case No. 16CR046, and that 16CR048 derives from the same underlying facts. As such, pursuant to Crim. R. 9, the prosecutor erred by issuing a warrant for his arrest when Appellant should have been summoned.",Did not reach error/conduct did not result in prejudice,"{¶25} However, the language of the rule further, clearly states that the
clerk shall issue a summons where the defendant has been released and “is indicted for the same offense for which he was bound over.” 

While the indictment arises from the same underlying facts, Appellant was indicted on a separate offense, attempted murder. Appellant was bound over on R.C. 2903.11, felonious assault, and Counts Two and Three of the indictment are for felonious assault. Although arising from the same set of circumstances, attempted murder and felonious assault are separate offenses.

to allow leading questioning of A.D. about anal intercourse allegations.
{¶ 51} The record reflects that A.D. responded “yes” when asked whether Moore
ever had put his penis in her “butt.” The child stated that she could not remember “the
times” it had happened or where it had occurred. (Tr. at 91.) The prosecutor then asked
for permission to ask leading questions, explaining that the child previously had provided
more details about such incidents. (Id. at 92.) After taking an off-the-record break, the trial
court appears to have allowed limited leading questioning, although its ultimate ruling is
not on the record. (Id. at 92-96.) In any event, the prosecutor proceeded to question A.D.
about incidents of anal sex with Moore. (Id. at 96-101.) ",No error,"{¶ 52} Contrary to Moore’s argument, however, few of the prosecutor’s questions
accurately can be characterized as leading. “A leading question is ‘one that suggests to
the witness the answer desired by the examiner.’ ” (Citation omitted) State v. Diar, 120
Ohio St.3d 460, 2008-Ohio-6266, 900 N.E.2d 565, ¶ 149. Most of the prosecutor’s questions to A.D. involved a specific area of inquiry and were binary in nature in the sense
that they called for a “yes” or “no” answer. But the vast majority of the questions did not
suggest which answer the prosecutor desired. Nor did the prosecutor embed an answer
in the question. We have recognized that a question calling for a “yes” or “no” answer but
not suggesting the answer is not leading. State v. Taylor, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 20944,
2006-Ohio-843, ¶ 47, 56. To the extent any leading questioning did occur, trial courts
have wide latitude in handling such matters, particularly in cases involving alleged child
sex-abuse victims. State v. Howard, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 26360, 2015-Ohio-3917,

 “TURNER SUFFERED PLAIN ERROR AS THE PROSECUTOR’S OFFICE

{¶37} As part of the plea agreement, the state dismissed the three kidnapping counts and promised to recommend an “agreed to” sentence of 3 years for aggravated robbery and 12 months for having a weapon under disability to run concurrent plus the mandatory consecutive term of 3 years for the firearm specification, for a total of 6 years.
Appellant was fully advised the court was not bound by this joint recommendation and a PSI was ordered. ",No error,"{¶45} Consequently, Appellant’s appearance at sentencing was an express contractual term, and the plea agreement explicitly declared the state was not bound by the agreement to recommend the agreed sentence if Appellant violated this term.

erred by admitting hearsay testimony and by permitting the State to refer to that testimony
in closing argument as truth of the matter asserted. We disagree. 

{¶54} Appellant raises the following areas of alleged ineffective assistance: (1)
counsel was ineffective due to not objecting to the state’s reference to hearsay evidence
during closing arguments and (2) counsel was ineffective due to failing to object to witness
testimony that indicated Appellant was incarcerated. ",Did not reach error/conduct did not result in prejudice,"{¶44} In this case, the prosecutor cited Ms. Gomes’s testimony on what ML told
the prosecutor what Appellant said to her, that “he didn’t force anyone” and “it only
happened once.” Tr. 2, pp. 67-68. However, Appellant also told Detective Mongold that it
only happened once, and he did not force JL into sexual conduct with him. Similar to
McKelton, Appellant has not established that this testimony and reference are outcome
determinative as Appellant made the same remarks to Detective Mongold who also
testified at trial. 

{¶55} We note misconduct of a prosecutor at trial will not be considered grounds
for error unless the conduct deprives the defendant of a fair trial. State v. Apanovitch
(1987) 33 Ohio St.3d 19, 24, 514 N.E.2d 394. In regards to counsel not objecting to the
state’s reference to hearsay evidence during closing arguments, we found in Appellant’s
Second Assignment of Error the hearsay evidence referenced by prosecutor during
closing arguments was not outcome determinative, as Detective Mongold testified to the
same comments made by Appellant. Appellant has not shown that he was actually
prejudiced by the statements. In regards to counsel failing to object to witness testimony
that indicated Appellant was incarcerated, we found in Appellant’s Third Assignment of
Error the witness and prosecutor’s reference to Appellant’s pretrial incarceration fell well
short of the “constant reminder” of defendant’s incarceration discussed in Estelle. We
found the defendant was not prejudiced by this reference. Upon review of the complete
record, we are unpersuaded that trial counsel failed to provide reasonable representation
on the above two points. ",,,"Wise, John, P. J. ",,"Baldwin, J., and

disclose exculpatory evidence.  As Myers sees it, the inclusion of Mosley on the state’s witness list was evidence favorable to Myers “because Mosley had no credibility as a witness due to his receiving a plea bargain with the State on the eve of trial which took the possibility of the death penalty off the table and instead provided for life imprisonment without the possibility of parole in exchange for testifying against Austin Myers.” But Mosley’s testimony—which detailed the plan, the murder, and the cleanup—was far from exculpatory for Myers.

Much of the evidence at trial came from the testimony of his co-defendant, Mosley who also participated in the murder. 

In this appeal, Myers alleges a series of claims, including that the state delayed in providing evidence, including exculpatory. The court found that there was no delay and also that the evidence in question was not exculpatory.

Graham,Black,2016,Murder,aggravated murder,"agg burglary, agg robbery, kidnapping",,,Male,Death,checked,2016,"Examination of witnesses,Opening statements,Summation","Opening statements: 
{¶ 64} In proposition of law No. IV, Graham argues that the prosecutor
introduced other-acts evidence in violation of Evid.R. 404(B) when (1) during his opening statement, he said that Graham was known to carry a weapon and described a picture on Kremling’s cell phone as depicting Graham “wielding his two guns,” (2) he elicited testimony that Graham was known to carry a gun, and (3) he introduced a photograph of Graham holding two handguns

{¶ 73} We first briefly evaluate whether the prosecutor’s statement that
Graham possessed a gun was improper “evidence.” During his opening statement, the prosecutor said, “Damantae Graham is known to carry weapons, to have a weapon, and this day [the day of the murder] he has with him his weapon, 380 semiautomatic pistol.” (Emphasis added.) 

---------

Examination of witnesses:
{¶ 75} We next address Kremling’s testimony, in response to the
prosecutor’s questions, that Graham possessed a gun. 

------
Opening statements:
{¶ 95} In proposition of law No. III, Graham argues that the prosecutor
improperly bolstered the credibility of two of his codefendants, Kremling and Grier. {¶ 97} During his opening statement, the prosecutor stated that Kremling and Grier lied to the police about the robbery and murder after they were first arrested.

Summation: 
{¶ 98} Second, Graham argues that the prosecutor improperly vouched for Kremling and Grier during his closing rebuttal argument. 

Examination of witnesses:
{¶ 100} Finally, Graham argues that the prosecutor improperly bolstered
the credibility of Kremling and Grier by asking them about the truthfulness of their testimony.",Harmless error,"OPENING - no error

Because the prosecutor’s statement that Graham was “known to carry weapons” was not “evidence,” Graham’s contention that such statement was impermissible under Evid.R. 404(B) lacks merit. 


EXA. WITNESSES - harmless
{¶ 76} Assuming that information was relevant, the prosecutor’s
questioning and Kremling’s testimony fail the second part of the Williams analysis because it appears the state’s purpose was precisely the purpose forbidden by Evid.R. 404(B), as propensity evidence. See Williams, 134 Ohio St.3d 521, 2012- Ohio-5695, 983 N.E.2d 1278, at ¶ 20; Hartman at ¶ 21. Generalized statements and testimony that a defendant is known to carry a gun are generally inadmissible because they are meant to portray the defendant as a violent person {¶ 78} Thus, Kremling’s testimony that he knew Graham to carry a gun was improper.

-------

{¶ 89} Here, the photo was not admissible to prove identity. It did not show that Graham was at the apartment at the time of the crimes or directly tie him to those crimes. The photo also fails to establish modus operandi because it provides no “behavioral fingerprint” associated with the crimes in question. See Lowe at 531; Hartman at ¶ 38. Thus, the state’s theory for the admissibility of the photo lacks merit.
{¶ 90} Therefore, even though the photo may have had some relevance, it
was introduced to suggest that Graham has a propensity for gun violence and to imply that he acted in conformity with that character on the day of the crimes at issue. We hold that the photo fails the second part of the Williams test.
{¶ 91} Finally, we also conclude that the photo fails the third part of the
Williams test, because the probative value of the photo was substantially
outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. {¶ 92} Therefore, we hold that the photo was improperly admitted.

Graham cannot meet his burden to prove that the prosecutor’s statement, Kremling’s testimony, or the introduction of the photo prejudiced him by affecting the outcome of the trial, in light of the remaining evidence of Graham’s guilt. Thus, no plain error occurred.
{¶ 94} Based on the foregoing, we reject proposition of law No. IV. 

--------

SUMMATION
{¶ 99} None of these comments were improper. They neither implied
knowledge of out-of-court information nor placed the prosecutor’s own credibility in issue. Each comment dealt with matters that the jury could properly consider in evaluating Kremling’s and Grier’s credibility

DISSENTING
“Graham did not receive a fair trial due to the trial court permitting, over objection, an improper victim impact statement to the jury during the guilt phase of the trial constituting prosecutorial misconduct.” 

{¶ 119} The state elicited victim-impact testimony from a justifiably
grieving father during the guilt phase of the trial, and much of that testimony had nothing to do with the crimes. See State v. McKnight, 107 Ohio St.3d 101, 2005-Ohio-6046, 837 N.E.2d 315, ¶ 99 (father’s statement that “his daughter’s disappearance was ‘like somebody hit [him] in the stomach with a sledgehammer’ was of questionable relevance”).

been admitted at trial. ",Resentencing,"prosecutorial misconduct,Doyle v. Ohio",fischer,Patrick F. Fischer,"O’CONNOR, C.J., and FRENCH, J., concur.

by allowing Jeffrey Brenner, an audiovisual-forensics analyst with the Ohio Attorney General’s Office, to provide expert testimony about the videotaped recordings of the phone calls between Froman and Clark, because the state did not comply with Crim.R. 16(K) prior to trial

--------
{¶ 113} In proposition of law No. 5, Froman argues that his judgment of
conviction and death sentence should be reversed due to the prosecutor’s misconduct during the mitigation phase of the trial. 

A) {¶ 115} Froman argues that the prosecutor committed misconduct by
“badgering” one of his mitigation witnesses, Dr. Nancy Schmidtgoessling, during the prosecutor’s cross-examination of her. 

B) {¶ 123} Froman argues that the prosecutor committed misconduct by
arguing that the crime itself was an aggravating circumstance.

C) {¶ 127} Froman argues that the prosecutor committed misconduct during the mitigation-phase closing arguments by referring to Froman’s unsworn statement as “self-serving.” 

D) {¶ 130} Froman argues that the prosecutor disparaged him by referring to him during the trial by his nickname, “Tricke.”",Harmless error," Moreover, the fact that Brenner had been qualified as an expert witness in a previous case did not automatically render him an expert witness in this case.
{¶ 90} We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in ruling that Brenner was a lay witness. As such, we do not reach Froman’s argument that the state’s failure to comply with Crim.R. 16(K) should have precluded Brenner’s testimony. Based on the foregoing, we reject proposition of law No. 6.

---------

A) {¶ 122} The prosecutor’s two questions about the testing merely clarified that Froman had taken the tests well after the murders occurred, while he was awaiting trial. The prosecutor committed no misconduct in asking those questions, because they focused the jury’s attention on the reliability of the test results. 
B) {¶ 126} In any event, Froman cannot show that he was prejudiced by the prosecutor’s comment, because the trial court correctly instructed the jury on the aggravating circumstances and the proper standard for the jury to apply in its weighing process.

C) {¶ 129} Here, the prosecutor’s brief comment on Froman’s unsworn
statement was directed at the statement’s credibility. Moreover, the trial court sustained Froman’s objection to the prosecutor’s comment and instructed the jury to disregard it. Again, the jury is presumed to have followed the court’s instructions. In any event, Froman has
not shown that he was prejudiced by this statement. 

D) {¶ 131} It is improper for a prosecutor to use a defendant’s nickname for the purpose of impugning the character of the defendant. the prosecutor’s use of Froman’s nickname was unnecessary and might have been an attempt to impugn his character. Again, however, the evidence admitted against Froman was overwhelming. Based on that evidence, we cannot conclude that the prosecutor’s referring to Froman by his nickname prejudiced the outcome of the trial. Thus, we conclude that no plain error occurred.

OTHERS: {¶ 88} In his fourth proposition of law, Kirkland contends that the state violated Evid.R. 404(B) by introducing evidence relating to the murders of Mary Jo Newton and Kimya Rolison, because the resentencing hearing was not for those two murders. 
-----
EXAMINATION: {¶ 92} Kirkland also contends that during the cross-examination of a defense mitigation witness, the prosecutor introduced evidence that Kirkland had been convicted of a 1987 homicide, a homicide that was not part of the course of conduct. 
-----
SUMMATION: {¶ 115} In his seventh proposition of law, Kirkland contends that prosecutorial misconduct in closing arguments denied him a fair trial.
First, Kirkland contends that the prosecutor committed misconduct by speculating as follows on the dying thoughts of Esme K [...]
{¶ 118} Kirkland also argues that the prosecutor improperly “belittled” and
“personally attacked” Dr. Wu [....]",Harmless error,"{¶ 90} Nor were the Newton and Rolison murders introduced to prove
Kirkland’s character in order to show that he acted in conformity therewith. That is, they were not introduced to show that he was guilty of murdering Esme and Casonya. Again, the Newton and Rolison murders were part of Kirkland’s course of conduct, which was one of the aggravating circumstances the jury was required to weigh against the mitigating factors. As such, they were central to the sentencing determination the jury had to make and could not be unfairly prejudicial.
-------

{¶ 98} The defense did not object to any of these references to the 1987
murder. Kirkland’s failure to object forfeits this issue, absent plain error. We find no plain error here because the jury already knew about the 1987 murder.

But the above argument was not. The prosecutor instead cited his own experience and placed his personal credibility in issue
{¶ 120} However, the prosecutor’s prompt withdrawal of the improper
comment diminished its prejudicial effect. 

Kirkland has identified two improper comments by the prosecution, both of which were mitigated to a degree. These isolated instances did not “pervade the trial to such a degree that there was a denial of due process,” We therefore conclude that any error with respect to
the prosecutor’s comments did not prejudicially affect Kirkland’s substantial rights. Kirkland’s seventh proposition of law is overruled. ",,prosecutorial misconduct,French,Judith L. French,"O’CONNOR, C.J., and KENNEDY, FISCHER, DEWINE, and STEWART, JJ.,

prosecutor engaged in misconduct during jury selection. He accuses the prosecutor of “employ[ing] a strategy to assert multiple groundless objections” to the defense’s voir dire questions in order to “obstruct” counsel’s efforts to identify the jurors who were excludable under Morgan, 504 U.S. at 729, 112 S.Ct. 2222, 119 L.Ed.2d 492,
as predisposed to impose the death penalty

{¶ 178} Madison’s eighth proposition of law posits that it was misconduct
for the prosecution to refer to him as a “serial killer.” As we have discussed above, this appellation was accurate, relevant, and in no way improper. Madison’s eighth proposition of law is overruled.

{¶ 179} In his 15th proposition of law, Madison contends that the state
committed prosecutorial misconduct in both the guilt and penalty phases. 

{¶ 185} Next, Madison contends that the prosecutor committed misconduct in the guilt-phase closing argument by saying Madison was a “professional” killer after he committed his second murder. 

{¶ 186} Finally, Madison says that the prosecutor committed misconduct in closing argument by arguing that he lacked remorse

{¶ 187} As to the penalty phase, Madison first argues that the prosecutor
unfairly emphasized the grotesque nature of the murders and the autopsy
photographs. In cross-examining Dr. Davis, the prosecutor described the crimes as
“grotesque” and asked Dr. Davis if he had looked at the autopsy photos",No error,"{¶ 177} It is true that the prosecutor made numerous objections, but
Madison was not denied an adequate opportunity to identify Morgan-excludable jurors, and no such jurors were seated. Nothing in the record supports Madison’s accusation that the prosecutor deliberately made groundless objections as a strategy, and the prosecutor’s conduct in this regard did not render Madison’s trial unfair, see Smith v. Phillips, 455 U.S. 209, 219, 102 S.Ct. 940, 71 L.Ed.2d 78 (1992) (the touchstone of analysis in considering allegations of prosecutorial misconduct

committed misconduct by disparaging defense counsel during the trial-phase and
mitigation-phase closing arguments. Except where noted, however, trial counsel
failed to object and Ford thus has forfeited all but plain error. State v. Wade, 53
Ohio St.2d 182, 373 N.E.2d 1244 (1978), paragraph one of the syllabus",No error,"{¶ 372} Finally, Ford contends that the prosecutor attacked defense counsel
and not the evidence in arguing: “One of the things that I always, you know, think
is interesting is how a defense approaches a case. And that’s fine; they have the
right to do that however they want.” These comments implied that defense
counsel’s approach in defending Ford was insincere. See LaMar, 95 Ohio St.3d
181, 2002-Ohio-2128, 767 N.E.2d 166, at ¶ 167 (the prosecutor improperly
juxtaposed his “honest” case with the defense case and unfairly suggested that the
defense’s case was not honestly presented). Even so, we conclude that these were
isolated comments that did not deny Ford a fair trial. Thus, no plain error occurred. 

{¶ 386} The prosecutor made inappropriate sarcastic remarks twice and
also denigrated counsel on one other occasion. However, these were all relatively
isolated remarks that did not pervade the prosecutor’s overall mitigation argument. 
{¶ 389} After reviewing the mitigation-phase closing argument in its
entirety, we find that the prosecutors in Kirkland and Keenan committed far more
serious and pervasive errors than the prosecutor made here. Thus, we hold that the
prosecutor’s closing remarks were not substantially prejudicial and did not deny

vehicular homicide, and failure to stop after an accident",,,Female,18 years to life,,2017,"Discovery,Opening statements,Summation","{¶10} We begin our analysis with Ms. Benson’s third assignment of error,
which challenges the admission of expert testimony by a police investigator. We agree with Ms. Benson that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting certain aspects of the officer’s testimony because (1) Crim.R. 16(K) dictates that an expert must produce an expert report in advance of trial, and the state failed to do so, and 

2) certain opinions were “ultimate issue” testimony that improperly intruded on the jury’s province. Nevertheless, in light of the wealth of other, admissible evidence at trial, we find this error harmless, as more fully described below. 


---- OPENING- didn't reach error
Specifically, she charges that the following was inappropriate to remark in opening: “And the evidence will show you that what Briana Benson does then is stop. There’s not motion. She backs
up slightly, turns the wheel directly into Madie and drives forward over Madie.” Also in opening, the assistant prosecuting attorney said, “[w]hen she finishes this deep drastic turn into Madie * * *. It’s a distinct, it’s a deliberate turn into a human
being.” In closing, the prosecutor made several references to Ms. Benson turning her wheels into Ms. Hart, once stating that this was done “knowingly.”

CLOSING -harmless


In closing, the state
argued: I think what’s been presented to you here was the creation of an image. And the image that you were given is someone saying they were
panicked. Someone seated here with their hair up in a bun and a little
sweater on, that’s an image, ladies and gentlemen. But that is not the
person Madie Hart met on March 26th of 2017.
",Harmless error,"{¶21} While certainly Officer Halusek’s experience might enable him to appreciate details that others might miss, in this instance, we fail to see how his opinion on the intentionality of the act assisted the jury. The jury here was perfectly capable of watching the same video as Officer Halusek and drawing their own conclusion

""By watching the video I see the tires of the front of the car turn to the right and strike the individual. So, in that, you know, it became
clear to us that it was an intentional act when she turned to the right to strike her""

Later in his testimony, after offering that opinion, Officer Halusek linked his expertise to the ultimate issue:
""I view things differently than normal people do. I’m looking for the mechanics of what occurred in the crash. * * * I’m looking for things
such as brake lights of a vehicle. I’m looking for things as, did it accel, did it stop, did it go left, did it go right. * * * I’m not looking
necessarily at what generally people see""

We ultimately find the error here to be harmless, and the distinction
we draw with Hall turns on the caliber of properly admitted evidence between the two cases. In Hall, the other evidence at hand was comparatively weak, resulting in acquittal on eight of the 12 counts. Here, by contrast, the inculpatory evidence is much more extensive and powerful, as detailed above. 

CLOSING RULING 

We are inclined to agree that this characterization was inappropriate, but such an isolated remark does not rise to the level of plain error when considering the overall context and evidence of this case.

erred when it allowed the jury to consider propensity-type evidence weighing negatively on his character. This includes evidence that he was on “probation” or “parole,” was “wicked,” “dangerous,” “sold drugs,” and carried and sought guns. In addition to this testimony y, English directs us to closing argument, when the prosecutor remarked

{¶41} English concludes that because these attacks on his character were so pervasive and inflammatory, and were used by the prosecutor as proof of his guilt, a purpose specifically prohibited under Evid.R. 404(A) and (B), the aggregate effect of the evidentiary errors was a denial of his due-process right to a fair trial. 

--------
{¶73} English also contends the prosecutor elicited irrelevant and
inflammatory evidence from Detective Gehring in an attempt to show that the state’s witnesses and potential witnesses were in fear of English. Although the prosecutor should refrain from eliciting irrelevant and inflammatory evidence, we disagree with English’s characterization of this evidence. 

--------

{¶76} Finally, English claims prosecutorial misconduct occurred during jury selection. The prosecutor, when introducing the trial process and the general facts of the case to the jury, stated, “we don’t know what [defense counsel] thinks the evidence is going to show. She does not have to tell us, and that’s totally fair and within the rules. But we don’t know what her case theory is. We’ll find out when you find out.” 

-------------

{¶97} In his second assignment of error, English argues the trial court
erred during jury selection by allowing the prosecutor to use a peremptory challenge to remove an African-American potential juror, in violation of the prohibition against racial discrimination set forth in Batson v. Kentucky",Harmless error,"But the erroneous admission of Exhibits 27 and 28 and Ebony’s other-acts and negative character testimony did not rise to the level of plain error that affected English’s substantial rights, because it did not affect the outcome of the trial. 

The prosecutor’s remarks in closing argument directed to English’s character increased the risk of unfair prejudice, as did the lack of an instruction on any legitimate purpose for the evidence. We conclude that all of the challenged weapon and bad-character evidence admitting during Ebony’s testimony could not have appreciably impacted that determination, because of the strength of the evidence corroborating Crawford’s testimony—the physical evidence, Hardin’s testimony, and English’s actions after the shooting, including indisputable evidence of flight.

{¶65} The court’s admission of evidence showing English was on parole or probation at the time of his arrest was not error, much less plain error. 
Although the prosecutor in closing argument encouraged the jury to use
this character and other-acts evidence as evidence of guilt, when this evidence is removed, the outcome of the trial would be the same because the remaining evidence is overwhelming. Thus, the admission of this testimony was not plain error.

-------------

{¶72} We first reject English’s claim that the prosecutor’s elicitation and
improper use of character and other-acts evidence, referenced in the previous assignment of error, was misconduct that resulted in an unfair trial. English did not object to the prosecutor’s remarks in closing argument emphasizing the propensity evidence. While those remarks were improper, the attack on English’s character did not pervade the closing argument and rebuttal. Instead, they were overshadowed by proper argument directing the jury to the overwhelming evidence of guilt. Thus, we are persuaded that the verdicts would have been no different in the absence of the challenged conduct. 
-------
{¶78} It is improper for counsel to denigrate opposing counsel in the jury’s
presence. State v. LaMar, 95 Ohio St.3d 181, 2002-Ohio-2128, 767 N.E.2d 166, ¶
167. We do not condone the prosecutor’s unnecessary comment. But the record reflects that it was, in context, a spontaneous reaction, upon learning that the trial would start that day, as the defendant confirmed on that date the waiver of his right to discovery because he wanted to be tried “right away.” And the prosecutor was explaining, apologetically, that the state may be reviewing with potential jurors what turned out to be irrelevant topics such as self-defense. We cannot say that these remarks had any impact on the verdicts.

{¶79} Under these circumstances, we conclude that there is no basis for
disturbing English’s conviction on the grounds of prosecutorial misconduct. The fourth assignment of error is not well taken and is overruled


---------------

{¶108} On this record, it appears that the reasons offered by the prosecution were reasonably related to responses given by the prospective juror during voir dire and that her removal was not “ ‘motivated in substantial part by discriminatory
intent.’ ” See Foster at 1754, quoting Snyder, 552 U.S. at 478, 485, 128 S.Ct. 1203,
170 L.Ed.2d 175. Consequently, we conclude that the trial court’s finding of no discriminatory intent was not clearly erroneous. The second assignment of error is, accordingly, overruled",,Batson v.

In her fourth assignment of error, Davis argues that prosecutorial misconduct perpetrated during closing arguments deprived her of her rights to due process and a fair trial. Davis contends that the prosecutor committed misconduct in closing argument by improperly inserting personal opinion and commenting on the purported strength of the state’s case, misrepresenting the defense’s position, denigrating defense counsel, and improperly referencing punishment.

Discovery

{¶64} For ease of discussion, we next address Davis’s fifth assignment of
error. In her fifth assignment of error, Davis argues that she was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel because counsel failed to engage an automotive expert to render an opinion and for withdrawing the objection to the state’s failure to provide an expert report from Swartwout. ",Harmful error,"SUMMATION - harmless

Having reviewed the prosecutor’s rebuttal argument in its entirety, the
prosecutor inappropriately referred to sentencing with the following statements: A lot has been said, and I think [defense counsel’s] closing, said * * * if you convict [Davis], this will somehow be another tragedy. And the
Judge will tell you that you can’t consider punishment at all. Because if you find her guilty, whatever the penalty is left by law to Judge Marsh. And over the last couple weeks you’ve gotten to know Judge Marsh. And she’s an intelligent, compassionate person. And you know, and everybody in the room knows, that she will do the right thing in figuring out what sentence will be appropriate. You cannot consider sentencing at all.

FROM TRANSCRIPTS, rebuttal volume 11, Tieger said: 

“Some people may say she killed two people, it would have been better if she had died in that wreck, too. I think that’s a horrible way to think about this. Horrible. But for whatever reason, in a freak turn of events, a miracle happened to her. Because her truck was so extremely unroadworthy, it saved her life. It killed two, but it saved hers, because it was so defective. But it saved her for her to be judged by the legal system. And we would ask that you find her guilty as charged. Thank you”

RULING: However, the arguments of the state did not deprive Davis of a fair trial. Davis’s fourth assignment of error is overruled.


----------
DISCOVERY thro ineffective counsel for not objecting to the violation - harmful

Without the expert testimony, the jury may have considered the remaining evidence in a different light. The significance of Swartwout’s testimony is further reflected by the fact that the jury acquitted Davis of the two aggravated-vehicular-homicide charges for causing the deaths of Tell and Miller while operating a motor vehicle under the influence.
{¶72} Accordingly, we sustain the fifth assignment of error.

He claims that the prosecutor’s reference to his three prior convictions precluded him from receiving a fair trial. The State counters that Breneman’s argument is barred by the invited error doctrine, and that Breneman did not timely object to the prosecutor’s mentioning of the three prior felony drug abuse offense convictions. 

We conclude that Breneman invited the prosecutor’s reference to the three prior drug offenses in his opening statement. Moreover, with the unique record before us, we further conclude that Breneman was not
prejudiced by the prosecutor’s isolated reference to Breneman's three prior drug convictions, and no new trial was warranted.

sexual imposition, in the second case.",,checked,Female,Life,,2018,"Brady violation,Other or unknown,Summation","Other allegation (prosecution stealing the defense's strategy before trial):
{¶47} In his first assignment of error, Svoboda contends
that his due-process rights were violated and he was denied
the effective assistance of trial counsel due to the state's
confiscation and search of his legal paperwork. He urges us to
reverse the trial court's judgments and dismiss the indictments
on that basis.

{¶48} On April 11, 2019, the assistant prosecutor assigned to
Svoboda's case was listening to a jail call between Svoboda
and his sister when she came to believe that Svoboda was
in possession of a transcript of A.S.’s Mayerson Center
interview with Powers. According to the assistant prosecutor,
she provided the interview recording to defense counsel
marked “for counsel only.”2  The court reporter prepared a transcript of the interview at the state's request and provided defense counsel with a copy of the transcript. The assistant prosecutor suspected that defense counsel had
violated Crim.R. 16(C) by giving the interview transcript
to Svoboda or members of his family. According to her
affidavit, the assistant prosecutor discussed the quandary with
her supervisor and the “ethical hotline” and general counsel
for the Cincinnati Bar Association. After getting the okay
from her supervisor, the assistant prosecutor requested that
Svoboda's jail cell be searched for a copy of the transcript.

Brady allegation: 
{¶71} The second and third assignments of error relate to Svoboda's attempts to obtain surveillance videos of the seizure of his legal paperwork. Through subpoenas and a motion to compel, Svoboda sought the videos to verify the representations made by the state regarding the timing and scope of the assistant prosecutor's search. Svoboda also sought to use the videos in his case-in-chief. The trial court denied the motion and subpoenas. The videos were preserved, and Svoboda's appellate counsel had access to them for purposes of appeal, but the footage was not provided to trial counsel. Svoboda argues that this violated his right to compulsory process and amounted to a suppression of evidence favorable to him, in violation of Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). Specifically, Svoboda argues that the jury was entitled to know that the prosecution had stolen Svoboda's defense strategy before the trial. Svoboda contends that the videos would have allowed him to “impeach the credibility of the prosecution itself.”

Other allegation (prosecutor's general rule in other assignments of error):
Svoboda argues in his ninth assignment of error
that the state committed prosecutorial misconduct through its
role in the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, and
eighth assignments of error.
[40] {¶115} “Generally, prosecutorial misconduct will not
provide a basis for overturning a criminal conviction, unless,
on the record as a whole, the misconduct can be said to have
deprived the appellant of a fair trial.” State v. Simmons, 2014-
Ohio-3695, 19 N.E.3d 517, ¶ 72 (1st Dist.).

",Harmless error,"Other holding: 
{¶65} In the present case, there was no recording or surveillance footage of the assistant prosecutor's search for the trial court to review. From the surveillance footage we do have, we know that she had access to the paperwork for approximately 17 minutes. Because there is no recording that could tell us what the assistant prosecutor learned during her search, this case falls under the type described in Milligan where burden-shifting is appropriate once Svoboda has made a prima facie showing of prejudice. Svoboda has made such a showing by submitting an affidavit in which he stated that the documents taken from his jail cell contained notes relating to cross-examination of witnesses, trial preparation and strategy, and his own preparation to testify. See State v. Svec, 9th Dist. Lorain No. 18CA011341, 2020-Ohio-6793, 2020 WL 7490419, ¶ 27-29 (indicating that the defendant may have made a prima facie showing of prejudice if he had submitted affidavits in support of his assertion that he and his attorney discussed trial strategy during the intercepted phone calls).
{¶66} Nevertheless, we hold that the appointment of the special prosecutor neutralized any possible prejudice. The special prosecutor, as an officer of the court, stated during a hearing that as far as he was concerned, “it was as if the Defendant's jail cell was never searched. * * * In fact, everything that I have is stuff that pertains prior to that.”
{¶69} We must pause and state that we do not condone the
assistant prosecutor's reckless and misguided actions in any
way. How she or her supervisor could believe that searching
Svoboda's private legal paperwork was the right way to
handle her suspicion that defense counsel violated Crim.R.
16(C) is beyond this court's comprehension. Nevertheless,
dismissal of the indictments in this case would be too
extreme of a sanction in light of the special prosecutor's
representations to the court.
{¶70} Because we find that, on this record, the appointment
of the special prosecutor purged any taint, the first assignment
of error is overruled

Brady holding:
{¶74} The videos show when Svoboda's paperwork was
confiscated, how long the assistant prosecutor had access to
the paperwork, and when the paperwork was returned. While
the videos would have been helpful to Svoboda's trial counsel
in litigating the pretrial motions pertaining to the prosecutor's
search of Svoboda's legal paperwork, they are irrelevant to
the question of Svoboda's guilt or punishment. Therefore, the
court's denial of Svoboda's subpoenas and motion to compel
did not violate the Compulsory Process Clause or the Due
Process Clause. The second and third assignments of error are
overruled.

Other allegation's holding (prosecutor's general rule in other assignments of error):
{¶116} Svoboda has failed to demonstrate that the special
prosecutor committed any misconduct during the trial. The
ninth assignment of error is overruled.",,"Brady v. Maryland,prosecutorial misconduct",Crouse,Candace C. Crouse,"Zayas, P.J., and Winkler, J.","Marilyn Zayas,Robert C. Winkler",David P.

In the first he argues the trial court improperly permitted the state to present factual elements of its case during voir dire over his counsel's objection. We disagree. 

Appellant directs us to pages 128-137 of the transcript. Within these pages the prosecutor asked the prospective jurors where they believed sexual assaults occurred and instances they could think of where there would be no evidence of a sexual assault.

{¶ 16} At a side bar counsel for Appellant argued the prosecutor was ""starting to put into play facts not in evidence and we're trying to condition the jury on the case facts."" 

-------------
{¶ 30} In his final assignment of error, Appellant argues the trial court erred in denying his motion in limine to direct the state to refer to V.1 and V.2 as ""alleged victims."" We disagree. ",No error,"{¶ 17} Appellant argues that after the trial court overruled his objection, the prosecutor went on to explain the science behind delayed reporting and polled jurors on the same. But the record simply does not support Appellant's allegations. Rather, the record reflects the prosecutor asked if jurors would immediately discount the testimony of a child who did not report their abuse right away and further asked if jurors would be willing to listen to an expert explain why there may not be physical signs of trauma as a result of sexual assault. T. 134-137.
{¶ 18} Upon review of the record, we find the state's questioning of the venire was narrowly tailored to determine whether any potential jurors harbored any bias which would
make them ill-suited to determine this particular matter. Based on the circumstances of this case, the trial court's decision to overrule Appellant's objection was not error. We
therefore reject Appellant's arguments pertaining to voir dire. 
---------
 
Our examination of the record reveals Appellant did not lodge
an objection in any of these five instances. We further note four of these instances occurred during closing argument. Transcript of Trial, Volume III (T. III), 621, 624-625,
632, 651-652. Even if Appellant had objected there would be no error because in closing argument a prosecutor may comment freely on “what the evidence has shown and what
reasonable inferences may be drawn therefrom.” 

 Referring to the child victims as such in closing argument would therefore not be improper. 
Again, even if Appellant had objected to this use of the word ""victim"" we would find no prejudicial error as this was one isolated incident which took place during a three-day trial.

Among other challenges, appellant claimed that “[t]he State failed to disclose evidence regarding Kennedy.” Specifically, appellant argued that she was denied her constitutional rights to due process and a fair trial “because the State failed to comply with its affirmative disclosure obligations” pursuant to Brady, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215. Appellant claimed that “there is newly discovered evidence that Kennedy lied and the State should have reasonably known that Kennedy was giving perjured testimony.” Appellant stated that “two separate individuals have come forward with information that Kennedy lied at trial” and argued that “[t]his new evidence requires an evidentiary hearing[.]” Appellant further argued that the state had “withheld information that Jamison Kennedy was their witness and an informant in another murder trial prior to serving as a government witness in this case.”",No error,"First, we find the trial court correctly determined that the claim that
the state committed a Brady violation by failing to provide the defense with information that Kennedy had previously been an informant in another murder trial is barred by res judicata. This issue was decided in McFeeture, 2015 Ohio-1814, 36 N.E.3d 689, at ¶ 129.

Next, we find appellant has not demonstrated that any due process
violation may have occurred. In this case, the government did not suppress favorable evidence in violation of Brady because the state did not possess the documents, which did not even exist at the time of trial. Also, there is nothing to suggest that the state knowingly used false testimony to obtain a conviction. See Napue v. Illinois, 360 U.S. 264, 269, 79 S.Ct. 1173, 3 L.Ed.2d 1217 (1959) (“a State may not knowingly use false evidence, including false testimony, to obtain a tainted conviction* * *.”) Further, we are unable to conclude the trial court abused its discretion in finding the statements made in the letters lacked credibility.",,"Brady v.

erred when it allowed the state to elicit improper testimony from Detective Kellums with regard to C.H.’s disclosure of the alleged rapes.",Harmful error,"'- It is undisputed that the state never sought to have Detective Kellums qualified as an expert witness nor did the state provide an expert report pursuant to Crim.R. 16(K). Under the circumstances of this case, we find that the trial court admitted Detective Kellums’s testimony in error."" (paragraph 57)
- Detective Kellums gave improper opinion testimony regarding the consistency of statements C.H. and Roan made to him when compared to their text messages. Detective Kellums essentially opined that C.H. was a credible witness because her story was consistent and Roan was not a credible witness because he “never denied anything that [C.H.] said” in her text messages. It was within the province of the jury as the trier of fact to make a credibility determination, a role the detective impermissibly usurped. We find that the trial court committed error by allowing this testimony to reach the jury, and accordingly we must consider whether the error was harmless.""(paragraph 58)
- Turning to the second part of the analysis, we cannot say that this error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt or that there was no reasonable possibility that the testimony contributed to Roan’s conviction. This case involved a credibility battle without independent corroborating evidence of sexual assault. We find that Detective Kellums’s testimony improperly bolstered C.H.’s testimony, thereby impermissibly tipping the scales towards a guilty verdict. (paragraph 60)",New trial,harmless error,LARRY A.

The prosecution failed to present any evidence that a theft occurred at all, and as such failed to present sufficient evidence for a theft conviction as charged under the Ohio and United States Constitutions and the trial court erred in denying Mr. Craig’s Rule 29 Motion at the close of the prosecution’s case.

II. The prosecution failed to present sufficient evidence that the offense of money laundering as charged was committed in violation of the Ohio and United States Constitutions.

III. The prosecution failed to present sufficient evidence that the crime of engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity was committed.

IV. Mr. Craig was denied his right [to] counsel under the Ohio and United States Constitutions because the performance of defense counsel fell below a reasonable standard of competence and was so prejudicial that it
rendered the verdict unworthy of confidence.

V. The trial court committed plain error by permitting a stipulation contrary to the defendant’s testimony to be entered and in allowing the prosecution to engage in misconduct by eliciting testimony and making
commentary in closing that was contrary to Ohio Statutes and/or conflated civil statutes with criminal offenses and commentary in closing based upon the prosecutor’s personal opinion of Mr. Craig as a “scam artist” and similar commentary.

VI. The Appellant was denied due process and a fair trial pursuant to
U.S. Const. amend. V, VI and XIV and Ohio Const. art. 1 §10 as all of his
convictions are against the manifest weight of the evidence and the jury’s
verdict was inconsistent with the evidence and testimony presented. 

{¶ 135} In support of his fifth assignment of error, appellant makes two
prosecutorial misconduct arguments. First, appellant argues that the prosecutor committed misconduct at trial by eliciting testimony about appellant’s potential violation of inapplicable “sunshine laws” and ethical rules governing public employees.

¶ 136} Second, appellant argues that the prosecutor committed misconduct during closing arguments by stating that PHCA assets held by TCF were not PHCA’s assets, and by calling appellant a “scam artist.” ",No error,"RE THE PM:

{¶ 135} In support of his fifth assignment of error, appellant makes two
prosecutorial misconduct arguments. First, appellant argues that the prosecutor committed misconduct at trial by eliciting testimony about appellant’s potential violation of inapplicable “sunshine laws” and ethical rules governing public employees. While claiming that this line of questioning was improper, appellant does not explain how such testimony deprived him of a fair trial. It is clear from our review of the record that the allegedly improper evidence was isolated and did not permeate the trial. Moreover, when viewed in light of the state’s remaining incriminating evidence, which was extensive, we find that appellant would have been convicted even in the absence of any mention of “sunshine laws” and ethical violations. Thus, we find no plain error based upon the prosecutor’s elicitation of this evidence. 

{¶ 141} Like the courts in Houseman and Green, we find that the state’s isolated description of appellant as a “scam artist” during closing arguments in this case was not improper and did not deprive appellant of a fair trial. The prosecutor’s comment was based upon trial evidence that was before the jury, and it did not fall outside the latitude normally afforded a prosecutor in closing arguments. Further, in light of the state’s
evidence, we find that the comment did not alter the outcome of the proceedings. Therefore, we find no merit to appellant’s prosecutorial misconduct argument.

RE THE VACATED CONVICTIONS: {¶ 106} In short, the state’s evidence is insufficient to support the money laundering counts in this case for the same reason it failed in Searfoss: appellant cannot be convicted for money laundering under R.C. 1315.55(A)(3) for simply spending stolen funds to purchase real property for his own use, where such use does not “promote, manage, establish, carry on, or facilitate the promotion, management, establishment, or carrying on of corrupt activity.” R.C. 1315.55(A)(3). Accordingly, appellant’s second assignment of error is well-taken, and his convictions for money laundering must be vacated. ",Vacated,"prosecutorial misconduct,prosecutor misconduct","Mark L.

{¶48} The prosecutor asked appellant about pending felony and misdemeanor cases on cross-examination. Evid.R. 609 allows the state to impeach the accused's credibility with evidence of prior felony convictions. Here, the prosecutor arguably went beyond the Rule asking appellant about pending cases, a line of questioning that was
immediately extinguished by the trial court. In light of appellant’s testimony on direct about  not being “in trouble” since his felonies, the prosecutor raised the pending cases to attack appellant’s credibility for truth and veracity as Evid.R. 609 intends. ",No error,"{¶49} As we found supra, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing appellee to use appellant's prior convictions to impeach his credibility. Appellant's testimony on direct examination opened the door to further questioning on crossexamination about his prior convictions. Furthermore, since appellant's version of what
occurred during the encounter with police contradicted the other witnesses, his credibility was at issue. See, State v. Brown, 100 Ohio St.3d 51, 2003-Ohio-5059, 796 N.E.2d 506,

We find a reasonable probability exists that the jury would have reached a different decision if the exculpatory evidence had been known at trial. As such, we find the state's failure to disclose the statements of Anderson, Jenkins, and Mason constituted separate and distinct Brady violations that deprived Buehner of his right to due process.

{¶3} In 2016, Brantley filed a petition for post-conviction relief. Brantley sought a new trial on the basis that the State had elicited false testimony from two witnesses, Anthony Townsend and Deonte Woods. Brantley argued that the State failed to disclose that it had entered into agreements with Townsend and Woods in exchange for their testimony, in violation of the constitutional due process standard articulated by the United States Supreme Court in Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963) and Giglio v. U.S., 405 U.S. 150 (1972). The trial court entered judgment in favor of the State with respect to the portion of the petition pertaining to Mr. Woods on the basis that the conduct which gave rise to Mr. Woods’ indictment did not occur until after he testified in Brantley’s trial, meaning that no deal could have been in place at the time he testified.1 As for Brantley’s claims centering on Townsend’s testimony, the matter proceeded to a two-day hearing. After the hearing, the trial court permitted additional briefing and accepted a large appendix of evidentiary material. The trial court issued a journal entry denying the petition on April 5, 2021.

{¶5} In his first assignment of error, Brantley contends that the trial court abused its discretion by failing to apply the appropriate materiality standard in resolving his petition. In his second assignment of error, Brantley contends that the trial court abused its discretion when it ultimately determined that he had failed to meet the materiality standard and denied his petition.

Brady: 
{¶13} The State stipulated that “favorable evidence to [Brantley] was not disclosed to [the] defense[]” and that Brantley had satisfied the first two prongs of the Brady standard.3 The State disputed that Brantley could satisfy the materiality prong of the Brady standard in regard to either his conviction or sentence. A written stipulation was entered into the record.
{¶14} Throughout the post-conviction proceeding, Brantley insisted that Townsend’s testimony was material for Brady purposes because he was the only witness who placed Brantley and Haywood at the scene of the crime. Brantley called three witnesses and presented a large amount of evidence in support of this proposition.
",No error,"Brady: 
{¶19} In addition to the evidence presented at the hearing, the trial court considered multiple volumes of written materials in resolving the petition. On January 25, 2021, the trial court issued a journal entry denying Brantley’s petition on the basis that he had not satisfied the materiality prong of the Brady standard.

{¶27} A review of the record in this matter reveals that the testimony offered by Townsend regarding his whereabouts on the evening of the murders was consistent with information police obtained through phone records and surveillance videos. The State also presented evidence of cell tower logs that placed Brantley and Haywood near the Kimlyn Circle apartments on the evening of the murders.

{¶35} A careful review of the record reveals that the trial court did not abuse its
discretion in denying Brantley’s petition. This holds true regardless of whether the trial court applied the materiality standard set forth in Giglio or the materiality standard set forth in Bagley.
Even under the more defense-friendly materiality standard set forth in Giglio, Brantley has not demonstrated that there is any reasonable likelihood that Townsend’s false testimony affected the judgment of the jury with respect to either Brantley’s underlying convictions or the sentence imposed. See Giglio, 405 U.S. at 154.
{¶36} While Brantley analogizes the facts of this case to Giglio, we note that Giglio
involved a scenario where the prosecution’s case hinged “almost entirely” on the testimony of the witness who gave false testimony about his deal with the prosecution.
While Brantley argues that Townsend was the only witness to place Brantley and
Haywood at the scene of the murders, the State presented evidence of cell tower logs that showed Brantley and Haywood were in the vicinity of the Kimlyn Circle apartments around the time of the murders.

Kilbane,Sean Kilbane,Jacinto,Kainoa,Kainoa Jacinto,Other,2019,Assault,Felonious assault,,,,,Four years,,2019,Discovery,"In his third assignment of error, Jacinto contends that the trial court erred in allowing Hyde, a paramedic who treated Lee, to offer expert opinion testimony regarding the amount of force needed to cause Lee’s injuries, the direction from which that force would come and whether Lee was knocked unconscious prior to hitting the ground. 

Jacinto asserts that the trial court erred in admitting this opinion testimony because (1) it did not meet the requirements for lay opinion testimony under Evid.R. 701; (2) Hyde’s opinions were not disclosed in an expert report as required under Crim.R. 16(K), (3) Hyde lacked the expertise necessary to render the proffered “expert” opinions under Evid.R. 702 and (4) Hyde’s opinions were based on “assumptions” and lacked an adequate factual foundation. Jacinto argues that his conviction should be vacated and that he should be granted a new trial based on the improper admission of this testimony.


The state contends that Hyde’s testimony on direct examination that
(1) Lee’s injuries were consistent with someone being punched and immediately knocked unconscious rather than someone being punched and losing consciousness only after hitting the ground and (2) “it would take a significant amount of force to knock someone into unconsciousness before even hitting the ground” was admissible lay opinion testimony under Evid.R. 701, because it was rationally based
on his perception and was helpful to the jury",Harmless error,"Following a thorough review of the record, we agree that Hyde’s
testimony exceeded the scope of permissible lay opinion testimony under Evid.R. 701. [...]  We likewise agree that Hyde’s opinions regarding these
issues were not properly admitted under Crim.R. 16(K) and Evid.R. 702. No expert report was provided to the defense — aside from the EMS report which did not address these issues — and Hyde was not shown to have any expertise or specialized training in traumatic brain injuries or the forces required to cause those injuries as would be necessary to render expert opinions regarding these issues.

Nevertheless, we find that the trial court’s error in admitting this testimony was harmless. Crim.R. 52(A) provides: “Any error, defect, irregularity, or variance which does not affect substantial rights shall be disregarded.” See also R.C.
2945.83(C) (“No motion for a new trial shall be granted or verdict set aside, nor shall any judgment of conviction be reversed in any court because of * * * [t]he admission or rejection of any evidence offered against or for the accused unless it affirmatively appears on the record that the accused was or may have been prejudiced thereby.”); State v. Morris, 141 Ohio St.3d 399, 2014-Ohio-5052, 24 N.E.3d 1153, ¶ 24 (“Not every error requires that a conviction be vacated or a new trial granted.”). In order to prejudice a defendant, i.e., to “affect” a defendant’s “substantial rights” under Crim.R. 52(A), the error “‘must have affected the outcome of the [trial] court proceedings.’” State v.

Although Lindsey made several motions for mistrial during trial, he raises only two instances on appeal — (1) purported Crim.R. 16 violations; and (2) purported impermissible comments made by the state during closing arguments.

In his fourth assignment of error, Lindsey contends that trial court erred when it allowed impermissible comments to be made by the state during closing arguments, thereby denying him a right to a fair trial. Lindsey raises the same arguments in this assignment of error that he raises in his third assignment of error.

 
---------
In his sixth assignment of error, Lindsey contends that the trial court erred by admitting state’s exhibit No. 431 because it was hearsay in violation of Evid.R. 802 and 803. Specifically, Lindsey contends that the state’s use of the photo array was not used solely for impeachment, but was used as substantive evidence, i.e., to prove the truth of the matter asserted that Scott picked Lindsey out of the photo array as the shooter. And because it was used for this purpose, Lindsey contends that the photo array was inadmissible hearsay under Evid.R. 801(D)(1)(a). ",Harmless error,"{¶49} As the trial court noted, this was not a discovery violation per se. Once the state was aware of the gun discovery and recovery, it notified the defense that Detective Johnson
would testify, and defense counsel was able to interview the detective concerning the gun recovery. The violation complained of is more that the scope of questioning exceeded that which was agreed upon. Lindsey contends the scope of questioning was willful, prior knowledge would have aided in his defense, and the testimony was prejudicial

Nevertheless, we find no abuse of discretion in the trial court’s decision to deny the mistrial based on the discovery violation. The trial court correctly found that the state committed a discovery violation by failing to timely disclose Detective Johnson as a witness. Admittedly, the trial court’s “remedy” for the state’s violation was not a remedy at all because (and as the trial court later admitted), no reciprocal discovery violation was committed by the defense. Accordingly, the trial court’s “two violations cancel each other out” justification was misplaced. 
However, reviewing the entire record, Detective Johnson’s overall testimony was cumulative to or corroborative with Detective Stockwell’s testimony regarding gang activity. Thus, Detective Johnson’s testimony regarding gang activity was harmless, at best.


We agree, however, that the comment  was unnecessary, but it does not rise to the level of misconduct to warrant a new trial. Moreover, the comment about Lindsey’s lifestyle was based on evidence presented that he trafficked drugs.
{¶62} Viewing the complained-of comments in the context of the whole closing argument and trial, we find that the prosecutor did not engage in misconduct to deprive Lindsey of a fair trial.

------------------

{¶88} Assuming without deciding that the exhibit was inadmissible hearsay, its admission would be harmless. 
The admission of exhibit No. 431 is harmless because Scott testified about his prior statements to police. He admitted that on September 15 and 16, 2015, he told police that he did not see the shooters inside the white four-door car traveling northbound on East 113th towards Regalia. He further admitted that he was untruthful to the police about knowing Nance. At trial, he also admitted that on January 7, 2016, he asked to give information to the police as a “confidential informant.” On that date, he told the police that he saw “Nell shooting from the driver’s side” of the white car. (Tr. 1989.) He further told the police that day that “A.D.” was also in the car. (Tr. 1991.) When he was presented with a photo array, he was asked “if he knew anyone.” He identified “A.D.” as a possible shooter and Lindsey as the person shooting.",,"harmless error,prosecutorial misconduct",Kathleen Ann Keough,Kathleen Ann Keough,"Larry A.

Ladson’s right to remain silent. It is apparent that the prosecutor was not referencing Ladson’s failure to testify, but rather was referencing Ladson’s demeanor and lack of reaction to the evidence presented at trial.
Prosecutorial misconduct will not provide a basis for reversal unless we find that, based on the entire record, the misconduct deprived the appellant of a fair Trial… We find that the prosecutor’s comments were not improper.

reasons for excluding at least three prospective African-American jurors, who each expressed their ability to be fair and impartial. Morris additionally argues that the trial court did not contextually determine that there was a pattern of racially motivated challenges and removals of the prospective African-American jurors.",Harmful error,"(43) We agree with Kirk and Morris that the state’s use of peremptory challenges in the instant case exhibited a pattern against African-Americans jurors, especially in light of its “race-neutral reason” with regard to prospective juror No. 4. Indeed, the state’s mischaracterization of prospective juror No. 4’s statements during the Batson challenge is troubling.

(51) Just as in Strong, in the instant case, we are troubled by the state’s
proffered reasons for its peremptory challenges, in light of the fact that both the defense and the state previously questioned the juror and he answered questions appropriately. The state’s explanation for its peremptory challenge regarding prospective juror No. 4 — that based on the juror’s body posture and his “engineer” response, the juror was dishonest — essentially amounts to an expression of displeasure with the physical characteristics of the juror. We find this explanation to be disconcerting. Our finding is supported in the record by the state’s failure to make any inquiry of the “specific body language” or the truthfulness of this juror before excluding this prospective juror from the panel. Rather, the record demonstrates that this juror indicated that he possessed no reservations about his ability to serve as a juror. His responses were appropriate and articulate… excluding this juror in conjunction with the exclusion of prospective juror Nos. 1-3. In light of all the facts and circumstances, we conclude that the trial court erred in ruling that the State’s peremptory strike of prospective juror No. 4 was not motivated in substantial part by discriminatory intent.

In the first assignment of error, Ford argues the trial court erred by failing to properly inquire into the state’s race neutral reasons for peremptorily striking two prospective African-American jurors from the panel. 

14. First, Ford argues that with regard to prospective juror No. 8, the state offered implausible reasons for striking this prospective juror because the differences alleged by the state in this juror as compared to the empaneled white jurors were far from significant. 

18. Next, with regard to prospective juror No. 12, Ford argues the trial court erred by not independently and explicitly assessing the credibility of the state’s race-neutral reasons for excluding this prospective juror.",No error,"17. Here, the state articulated the following race-neutral reasons for striking this prospective juror: (1) his overpowering personality; (2) his heightened demand for police reports and transcripts; (3) his uncertainty about resolving discrepancies in memory during deliberations; (4) his dismissive and off-putting body language; and (5) his employment at the same company where defense counsel’s spouse served as vice-president and general counsel. The court discounted the state’s fourth and fifth reasons, but found compelling the state’s first reason. Based on the foregoing, we find that the trial court’s determination was not clearly erroneous with regard to prospective juror No. 8.

20. Here, the state initially explained that it wanted to remove prospective juror No. 12 because it learned that this prospective juror was a sibling of a Cuyahoga County assistant prosecuting attorney, and the siblings were currently feuding with each other. The colleague told the prosecutor trying the case that she would not want her brother on a jury. The prosecutor initiated the conversation with his colleague because he recognized the juror’s last name and asked if they were related. Prospective juror No. 12 did not mention this during the first day of voir dire, despite being questioned about knowing anyone who works for the court or having friends or family members who were members of a law enforcement agency.

23. The court, however, did not accept the prosecutor’s justification regarding his colleague’s concerns and the colleague’s family feud with prospective juror No. 12.

26. Under the totality of these circumstances, the concerns the court relied on represented a race-neutral explanation and were based upon something other than the race of the juror, even though the state offered to the court on the record that prospective juror No. 12 was feuding with his sister at the time of the voir dire.

27. Therefore, the first assignment of error is overruled.",,Batson v. Kentucky,MARY EILEEN KILBANE,Mary Eileen Kilbane,"EILEEN A. GALLAGHER, A.J., and
TIM McCORMACK, J., CONCUR","Tim McCormack,Eileen A. Gallagher",Michael C. O’Malley,Michael C.

Similarly with error but no prejudice in testimonies that used the heresay rule, the ""presumption"" was the error but there was no prejudice as it did not alter the case.

his convictions based on a violation of Brady and amended the motion on August 8, 2019. On March 10, 2020, the trial court determined that the motion was timely filed.

(14) Burton assigns two errors:
I. The appellant was denied his right to due [process] and right to a fair trial guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States and Ohio Constitutions when the state committed a Brady violation by failing to disclose exculpatory evidence.",Harmful error,"(34) The record in this case indicates that the New Tow Evidence directly
challenges the testimony of ECPD regarding when the Chevy was towed and inventoried as purportedly supported by the Trial Tow Evidence, and Burton’s claim that the contents of the Chevy was placed in the third-floor unit at the scene the night of the incident to attribute possession of the unit to Burton.

(37) The trial court specifically commented during sentencing that “the jury did not believe” that the ECPD obtained the mail and other evidence from the Chevy and planted it in the unit. (Tr. 548.) The New Tow Evidence indicates that the Chevy was towed by the ECPD on August 12, 2017, that two tows occurred during that period and the storage charge indicates the Chevy was stored with the storage company on August 25, 2017, for eight days. We find that the new evidence, if true, may be exculpatory and material pursuant to Brady.

(38) We find that under these facts, the denial of Burton’s petition without
a hearing constitutes an abuse of discretion. The due process implications in this. case warrant a hearing on Burton’s petition for postconviction relief.

Morton’s next ground for ineffective assistance of counsel was
counsel’s failure to object to the assistant prosecuting attorney vouching for two of the state’s witnesses during closing argument.

The other alleged misstatement Morton contends went unobjected to occurred when the assistant prosecuting attorney told the jury that trial court was allowing an instruction on the lesser-included offense of sexual battery “because the evidence shows it.” This statement is a close call.

Alternatively, they argue that they received ineffective assistance of counsel because had counsel obtained the alleged Brady information, they would have proceeded with the motion to suppress.",No error,"(16) First, any statement that Snyder tipped police off before they conducted their sweep of the home is not exculpatory information that would be subject to disclosure, even were it shown that such information was in the possession of the state. “Brady requires a reasonable probability of a different outcome with the exculpatory evidence, that is, an undermined confidence in the trial result obtained without the exculpatory evidence.” State v. Jackson, 57 Ohio St.3d 29, 33, 565 N.E.2d 549 (1991), citing United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667, 682, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 87 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985). A possibility that information might help the defense “‘does not establish ‘materiality’ in the constitutional sense.’” Id., quoting United States v. Agurs, 427 U.S. 97, 109-110, 96 S.Ct. 2392, 49 L.Ed.2d 342 (1976).


The trial court correctly determined that the new evidence regarding
statements from the victim was not exculpatory and, as such, not subject to
disclosure under the Brady rule. Further, appellants entered guilty pleas, waiving their ability to challenge the evidence and their abandoned motions to suppress. Appellants have not presented evidence that clearly shows they would have prevailed on the merits of a motion to suppress had they not entered pleas; therefore they have not shown they suffered ineffective assistance of counsel.

refusal to continue the case in response to a discovery violation. Minutes before opening statements, the prosecutor disclosed to defense counsel photographs showing injuries to the victim’s arm and face that the state intended to present as evidence. The photographs contained no date, timestamp, or other authenticating notation. Mr. Austin objected to their authenticity, requesting a one-day continuance to verify authenticity and gather contrary evidence if necessary for his defense. The request was effectively denied, as the court saw no reason to continue the case when presumably the state would authenticate the photos during its case-in-chief.",Harmless error,"Here, while the trial court failed to properly weigh the Darmond factors before denying the continuance, the record demonstrates the error was harmless. Unlike in Hall, the photos played no significant role either during trial or at sentencing. 

The state turned over all other requested discovery approximately
four months before trial. The discovery response included an incident report, an arrest and investigation report, a weapons report, Ms. Bailey’s statement that she was injured, and a witness list. At least two corroborating witnesses—a nurse from Bethesda Hospital and the police officer who took the pictures—testified at trial, verifying the nature of the injuries sustained. In light of that testimony, it minimized the significance of the photos, which may explain why they received so little attention during trial. Because we are confident that the trial court’s error had no impact on the verdict, we overrule Mr. Austin’s first assignment of error in its entirety. ",,harmless error,Bergeron,Pierre H.

As a general rule, parties must “provide to opposing counsel a written witness list, including names and addresses of any witness it intends to call in its case-in-chief * * * .” Crim.R.16(I). However, prosecutors may withhold this information by filing a certification of nondisclosure. See Crim.R. 16(D). But prosecutors cannot file nondisclosure certifications arbitrarily: as relevant here, a prosecutor must have “reasonable, articulable grounds to
believe that disclosure will compromise the safety of a witness, victim, or third party, or subject them to intimidation or coercion.” Crim.R. 16(D)(1). “Reasonable, articulable grounds may include”: “[1] the nature of the case, [2] the specific course of conduct of one or more parties, [3] threats or prior instances of witness tampering or intimidation, whether or not those instances resulted in criminal charges, [4] whether the defendant is pro se, and [5] any other relevant information.” Crim.R. 16(D). In other words, the prosecutor must provide “case-specific reasoning to justify the certification.” State v. Davenport, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-130307, 2014-Ohio-2800, ¶ 39.

{¶14} The nondisclosure certification mustered here, steeped in generalities and vagueness, failed to satisfy Crim.R. 16(D). In fact, most of the certification simply incanted boilerplate language with no relation to this case: 

In his second assignment of error, Mr. Baber focuses upon prejudicial testimony injected by one of the state’s witnesses regarding the video footage. Specifically, the lead detective testified that he zoomed in on the video, revealing a muzzle flash. From the context of his testimony, this indicated that the individual with the blue and orange sweatshirt (who the state fingered as Mr. Baber) fired the gun. If true, the detective’s testimony would answer one of the central issues of the case: who fired the gun.

Unfortunately, the testimony appears cut from whole cloth. Both parties agree that the testimony was inadmissible because the detective was invading the province of the jury. Nor did the prosecutor have any evidence that a muzzle flash could be identified in the video. Our review of the video likewise comes up empty with respect to any muzzle flash. Either the detective made up this evidence, or it existed and he neglected to share it with the prosecutors (or defense counsel).",Harmless error,"If the state can simply say “we are concerned because this is a serious case,” without more, and avoid disclosure, it transforms Rule 16(I) into a hollow letter.

Both parties agree that the testimony was inadmissible because the detective was invading the province of the jury. Nor did the prosecutor have any evidence that a muzzle flash could be identified in the video

Although we see a few errors in the trial proceedings, none rise to the level of reversible error. The evidence against Mr. Baber, while certainly not overwhelming, was powerful and probative, including the video recording and eyewitness identifications. Taking into account the totality of the record, we find the errors at hand harmless, and therefore we affirm the trial court’s judgment. ",,harmless error,Bergeron,Pierre H. Bergeron,"Crouse

I. David Fields was denied effective assistance of counsel during the jury selection process when, one, counsel failed to raise a Batson challenge and, two, when counsel failed to request to voir dire the jury on whether they heard Mr. Fields call the jury the composition of the nearly all white jury to be “racist.”
II. Mr. Fields received ineffective assistance of counsel when counsel failed to object to multiple pieces of inadmissible evidence.
III. Fields’s conviction is against the manifest weight of the evidence and, accordingly, Fields was denied his fundamental right to a fair trial as guaranteed by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.
IV. Mr. Fields received ineffective assistance of counsel when counsel failed to object to the trial court improperly providing the jury with a flight or “consciousness of guilt” instruction without a sufficient factual basis to support such an instruction, which violated Mr. Fields’s state and federal due process right to a fair trial.",Did not reach error/conduct did not result in prejudice,"Fields has not shown that peremptory challenges were used to challenge potential jurors solely on the basis of race. Of the two Black jurors that were excused, one was excused for cause. Fields cannot make a prima facie case that the state engaged in racial discrimination and counsel was not ineffective for not raising a Batson claim.

Fields next claims that his counsel was ineffective for not asking to voir dire the panel after he called the jury “racist.” Although the record does not reflect what Fields said, the record does reflect that counsel for Fields informed the court that Fields had said the jury was “racist” and counsel was concerned what effect that might have on the jury. The trial court stated that it did not hear Fields’s comment. The record does not indicate that this comment had any impact on the jury, other than a juror looked at the defense table after the comment was made, and Field has failed to set forth clear evidence that this comment deprived him of a fair trial by improperly influencing the jury.

Groce,Black,2016,Drugs,Engaging in corrupt acts,"drug trafficking, illegal manufacturing of drugs, drug trafficking, felonious assault",,,Female,36 years,,2016,Summation,"In his fourth assignment of error, Groce argues the prosecutor made several
remarks during the state's closing argument that deprived Groce of his right to a fair trial. More specifically, Groce challenges as improper and prejudicial the prosecutor's statements that (1) represented the surveillance video equipment to be motion activated; (2) expanded the scope of the engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity charge to events beyond the predicate offenses listed in the indictment; and (3) urged the jury to consider the photographs of the tattoo for an impermissible purpose. In Groce I, we considered Groce's argument as it related to the first and third of these allegations, and we found the argument moot as it related to the second of these statements since it related to his conviction of
engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity. As the Supreme Court's decision in Groce II found sufficient evidence to support Groce's conviction of engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity, we now consider his argument under his fourth assignment of error related to the prosecutor's statements allegedly expanding the scope of the engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity charge.",Did not reach error/conduct did not result in prejudice,", as the Supreme Court determined the video evidence, alone, constituted sufficient evidence of the enterprise, Groce cannot demonstrate that the prosecutor's statements about the conduct observed beyond March 29, 2016 prejudiced him or deprived him of a fair trial.

He also says this court relied on the misleading evidence in finding sufficient evidence as to causation.",No error,"{¶22} In support, Appellant cites from a recitation of testimony in a Tenth District medical malpractice case and other cases. However, the recitation of a witness’s opinion in setting forth the facts of a case was not a legal holding. And again, evidence outsidethe record cannot be used in a direct appeal (or the reopening of a direct appeal). SeeHartman, 93 Ohio St.3d at 299. Moreover, there is no indication any alleged error in the coroner’s testimony was a result of prosecutorial misconduct. Had the matter been raised to the trial court, there is not a reasonable probability the trial court would have taken judicial notice of the scientific opinions herein alleged by Appellant.

Regardless, as set forth supra, Appellant failed to submit a sworn
statement. This sworn statement is a mandatory aspect of an application to reopen as stated in App.R. 26(B)(2)(d). Lechner, 72 Ohio St.3d at 375. The lack of a sworn
statement in support of an application to reopen is a sufficient basis to deny the

Rivera,Holcomb,Darius,Darius Holcomb,Black,2018,Assault,Domestic Violence,"Felonious assault, fifth degree felony knowing the victim was pregnant",checked,,Female,5 ,,2018,Other or unknown,"'={¶21} Appellant sets forth one assignment of error, which he says requires theelimination of one count of felonious assault and a new trial on the other felonious assaultand the two domestic violence convictions. His sole assignment of error contends:“Count 4 should have never made it to trial. It was prosecutorial misconduct forthe state to bring it, and it was also error for the trial court to allow it to go forward.”
{¶22} Appellant says it was improper to allow both felonious assault counts to
proceed to trial before a jury as they were brought for the same event (hitting the victim in the head with a gun.)",Did not reach anything/ reverses on other grounds," Pursuant to statutory and case law, the state was permitted to prosecute
Appellant for both types of felonious assault, and the trial court did not err in failing to dismiss a count or force an election prior to trial. Accordingly, there was no error, plain or otherwise, in allowing the jury to return a verdict on counts three and four. Additionally, substantial rights were not affected as the evidence was overwhelming and there was no indication the jury was misled by submission of verdict forms on both types of felonious assault. Appellant’s assignment of error is overruled. 

{¶39} As pointed out in the statute and the case law, the submission of bothfelonious assault offenses to the jury was not improper, but sentencing on both would beimproper where they were subject to merger. See Goff, 82 Ohio St.3d at 135; R.C.2941.25(A). Although Appellant’s brief does not raise an issue with the method of mergeroccurring at sentencing, an observation in the factual section of his brief prompts thiscourt to further consider the statements at the sentencing hearing and in the sentencingentry. The brief observes: “The trial court noted that counts 3 and 4 merged, and orderedHolcomb to serve five years on both counts (not each) of those counts. The one-yearsentence of counts 1 and 2 were to be served concurrently to the five years of counts 3and 4, for a total of six years.” (Apt.Br. 3).
{¶40} If true, this describes a glaring error. Considering the fact that an underlyingreason we found Appellant’s assignment of error lacked merit was based upon hisacknowledgement the offenses were merged at sentencing, we shall delve into aconsideration of whether merger was accomplished by the trial court’s characterization.{¶41} The state elected count three for conviction and sentencing and advised thecourt a sentence should only be imposed on count three. (Sent.Tr. 4). The election ofcount three for sentencing was the state’s right, which the trial court was required toaccept after finding merger appropriate. Whitfield, 124 Ohio St.3d 319 at ¶ 20-21, 24.The trial court agreed the felonious assault offenses merged. (Sent.Tr. 23).",Resentencing,prosecutorial misconduct,Robb,Carol Ann Robb ,"Waite, J.

race-based testimony in his trial. As he was not specifically charged for a hate crime, he
claims this evidence constituted prejudice and denied him a fair trial. After Traylor testified
that Appellant referred to her with the use of a racial slur, Collins testified about his
encounter with Appellant. Appellant cites to the following direct testimony of the victim, Collins. ",No error,"{¶33} Generally, testimony about a defendant’s own prior statements is nothearsay when offered by the state pursuant to Evid.R. 801(D)(2)(a). Although Appellant denied that he used a racial slur in referring to Traylor, both Traylor and Collins testifiedthat Appellant called her a “n****r bitch.” (6/10/19 Tr., p. 249.) Although the statementsare racist and inflammatory in nature, that fact alone does not make them inadmissibleas an exception to hearsay under Evid.R. 801(D)(2)(a). Collins’ testimony regarding the significance of the use of a racial slur directed at his fiancé is not prejudicial to Appellantin this matter, as it speaks to Collins’ experience and feeling regarding the use of thestatement and explains why he struck Appellant. Of particular importance is the fact thatAppellant concedes Traylor’s testimony regarding Appellant’s use of a racial slur wasalready before the jury. Thus, whether Appellant made the derogatory comment and theimpact this may have had on the situation appears relevant as to what led to Collins’decision to strike Appellant, at the very least. Appellant also cannot demonstrate thatCollins’ testimony materially prejudiced him at trial. Appellant admits he shot Collins inthe back. Whether he directed the slur at Traylor or not, the record is devoid of any factsthat would allow a jury to find he was justified in the use of deadly force, here.

{¶ 64} Hawkins asserts that leading questions and use of a “board” at trial violated his right to a fair trial, and that the State’s leading questions undermined the verdict because the State essentially testified instead of M.S. ",No error,"Most significantly, even if the prosecutor had asked any improper leading
questions of M.S., “there is a presumption that in a bench trial the trial court relies ‘only on relevant, material, and competent evidence in arriving at its judgment.’ ” State v. Brodie, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 20877, 2006-Ohio-37, ¶ 41, quoting State v. Lane, 108 Ohio App.3d 477, 484, 671 N.E.2d 272 (1995). As the fact-finder, the judge was in the best position to discern whether M.S. was telling the truth or whether the State had suggested to her the nature of Hawkins’s conduct.
{¶ 70} Finally, we note that the “board” to which Hawkins objects was not admitted into evidence. The record suggests that it was used merely to summarize M.S.’s testimony as to each offense by reference to her address and school year. As the State notes, Hawkins did not object to the use of the chart until it was completed. There is no basis to conclude that the objection had merit or that Hawkins was prejudiced by the “board.”

new trial because the State committed prosecutorial misconduct during its closing argument.
{¶ 28} We have recognized that “improper prosecutorial comments amount to
misconduct only if they prejudicially affected the substantial rights of the accused.” State v. Ward, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 18211, 2001 WL 220244, *10-11 (Mar. 2, 2001). When conducting the analysis, the reviewing court should “focus on the fairness of the trial, not the culpability of the prosecutor.” State v. Reed, 2d Dist. Montgomery Nos. 18417 & 18448, 2001 WL 815026, *2 (July 20, 2001). When the alleged misconduct takes place during the State’s closing argument, the appellate court should consider the effect that “the misconduct had on the jury in the context of the entire trial.” State v. Keenan, 66 Ohio St.3d 402, 410, 613 N.E.2d 203 (1993).
{¶ 29} Prosecutors are entitled to considerable latitude in opening statement and closing argument. State v. Ballew, 76 Ohio St.3d 244, 255, 667 N.E.2d 369 (1996). In closing arguments, the State may comment freely on “what the evidence has shown and what reasonable inferences may be drawn therefrom.” State v. Lott, 51 Ohio St.3d 160, 165, 555 N.E.2d 293 (1990). See also Speigelman, Prosecutorial Misconduct in Closing Argument: The Role of Intent in Appellate Rev., 1 J. App. Prac. & Process 115, 134 (1999) (“The standard for proper closing arguments begins with the concept that they are
opportunities for the parties to present their view of the proper inferences to be drawn from the evidence presented.”); Am. Bat Assn. Standards for Criminal Justice 3-5.8, cmt. at 107 (1993) (“The most elementary rule governing the limits of argument is that it must be confined to the record evidence and inferences that can reasonably be drawn from it.”).
{¶ 30} Prosecutorial misconduct only constitutes reversible error in rare instances. Keenan at 405. Accordingly, a reversal for prosecutorial misconduct will only occur if it is clear that the trial’s outcome would have been different if not for the misconduct. State v. Smith, 14 Ohio St.3d 13, 15, 470 N.E.2d 883 (1984).
{¶ 31} Here, the statement James highlights was made by the State in its closing argument, apparently to explain that James used a deadly weapon. The prosecutor stated:
But whatever she used was a deadly weapon. As I said before, she is slicing
and dicing a 20-year-old girl. You saw her injuries just now. Hitting her on
the top of the head, her mouth, her chest, her tongue. That could have easily
hit her neck, sliced her carotid, and Houston would have been dead.
Trial Tr. at 394. James contends that the prosecutor’s statement was both unsupported by the record and substantially prejudicial. We disagree. ",No error,"Finally, the statement did not prejudicially affect the substantial rights of
James. There was sufficient evidence in the record for the jury to find James guilty. The entire incident was caught on tape, which the jury saw, from James pulling her car behind Houston and the initial argument, to the physical altercation, to James driving off. The jury also had the testimony of both women to consider, and they both told essentially the same story – they argued, things got heated, a fight ensued, and James slashed Houston
with a knife. Finally, there were the pictures that revealed the serious physical harm inflicted on Houston. Even without the prosecutor’s statement, the verdict would have likely been the same.

He supported the various aspects of that claim with evidence gleaned from the case file provided in response to his public-records request.

To the contrary, the record provides clear and convincing proof that Long had been unavoidably prevented from timely discovering and presenting in a new-trial motion the evidence upon which his new trial motion depended, and that under the circumstances, a 90-day delay in filing the motion after that evidence was discovered was understandable and not unreasonable.

appeal derives. In each petition, he sought relief from his convictions on nine
grounds, each alleging a denial of due process as a consequence of “prosecutor vindictiveness” and/or “fraud on the court.” He asserted that the assistant prosecuting attorney who had prosecuted him on robbery and gun charges in 2002 and 2003, acting out of “vindictiveness” over the dismissal of those charges, had “jumped” on the rape case charged in his 2004 indictment, had caused the return of his 2006 indictment, and had engaged in multiple instances of prosecutorial misconduct before and during his 2007 trial. He argued that he had not known until May 2018 that the assistant prosecuting attorney had also unsuccessfully prosecuted him in 2002 and 2003 or that evidence of prosecutor vindictiveness and fraud on the court “could be used” to challenge his convictions. And he argued that, but for the
alleged due-process violations, “no reasonable judge or jury would have found [him] guilty of [the charges in the 2006] indictment because [that indictment] would not [have] exist[ed] or made it to trial or [he] could have fought it on appeal.”",No error,"The due process violations alleged in Maddox’s 2019 postconviction petitions, if demonstrated, would in no way alter that assessment. Thus, the petitions and supporting evidentiary material, when considered with the trial record, cannot be said to demonstrate that, but for the claimed constitutional violations, no reasonable factfinder would have found Maddox guilty of rape. Therefore, Maddox failed to satisfy the R.C. 2953.23(A)(1)(b) jurisdictional requirement of demonstrating an outcome-determinative constitutional violation during the proceedings leading to his convictions.

{¶9} Because the common pleas court had no jurisdiction to entertain
Maddox’s 2019 postconviction petitions, the petitions were subject to dismissal without a hearing. See R.C. 2953.21(D) and (F) and 2953.23(A). We, therefore, modify the court’s judgment denying the petitions to reflect their dismissal. See App.R. 12(A)(1)(a). And we affirm the judgment as modified.

In his first assignment of error, Marshall argues that the state failed to disclose evidence in a timely manner, depriving him of his due-process rights under the Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Article I of the Ohio Constitution. In his second assignment of error, he argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a mistrial. 

Discovery allegation: 
{¶13} Next, Marshall argues that the state violated Crim.R. 16, and therefore, his motion for a mistrial should have been granted.",Harmless error,"Brady holding: 
First, Marshall contends that the state’s failure to timely provide the interview notes violated the Brady rule, which requires the prosecution to disclose exculpatory evidence to the defense. See Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963) (“[T]he suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.”). But, there can be no Brady violation when the exculpatory information was provided to the defense before or even during the trial. State v. Wickline, 50 Ohio St.3d 114, 116, 552 N.E.2d 913 (1990), citing United States v. Agurs 427 U.S. 97, 103, 96 S.Ct. 2392, 49 L.Ed.2d 342 (1976). This court recently explained that “a defendant is not prejudiced where the exculpatory material is discovered before or during trial and there are other remedies available which allow he exculpatory material to be entered into evidence.” State v. Jones, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-180091, 2019-Ohio-4862, ¶ 60, citing State v. Aldridge, 120 Ohio App.3d 122, 146, 697 N.E.2d 228 (2d Dist.1997). Because the interview notes were provided the day trial was scheduled to begin, and there were other remedies available to the defense to make use of that information, there was no Brady violation in this case. 

Discovery holding: 
{¶17} Knowledge on the part of a law enforcement officer is imputed to the state, but a determination of willfulness focuses only on the acts of the prosecution. Id. at ¶ 45. Marshall does not claim that the state intentionally withheld the notes, and the record shows that it was Davis’s negligence that led to their late disclosure. There is no evidence that the late disclosure of the interview notes was a willful violation.

""{¶21} A discovery violation is not prejudicial where it was not willful and the evidence was disclosed in sufficient time for the defendant to effectively use it at trial. Simmons, 2014-Ohio-3695, 19 N.E.3d 517, at ¶ 1. The most effective use of the interview notes would have been a pretrial motion to suppress, which Marshall’s counsel did not file because he received the notes a mere two hours before trial. However, defense counsel effectively used the interview notes by cross-examining Davis on the time discrepancy and pointing it out to the jury during closing argument.

 [... ]Marshall has failed to show that there is a reasonable probability that the trial court would have granted the motion to suppress. Without a reasonable probability that the statements would have been suppressed, we cannot say that the court abused its discretion in denying the motion for a mistrial",Resentencing,Brady v. Maryland,Crouse,Candace C. Crouse,"Bergeron, Winkler","Pierre H. Bergeron,Robert C. Winkler",Joseph T. Deters,Joseph T. Deters,"Marshall alleged a Brady and discovery violation because the state waited until the day of the trial starting to provide some information to the defense. The court held that there was no violation since the information was provided (even if late).

GA 10/27 - The court vacated the consecutive nature of the sentences and remanded it for a new sentencing hearing. But maintains no error on the Brady and discovery violations.

Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), by withholding exculpatory evidence from his trial counsel. The exculpatory evidence that Murphy claims the state withheld are statements made by the victim prior to trial during meetings with the prosecutors. He contends that the victim attempted to recant the allegations but was told that she was unable to recant. Additionally, Murphy contends that the victim provided varying accounts of the allegations during those conversations. Finally, he maintains that the victim told the prosecuting attorney that she was uncertain whether the allegations were true because she had false, but vivid, memories of attending a boot camp for children who misbehaved. According to Murphy, those statements from the victim were recorded or memorialized but never provided to trial counsel.

(36) Murphy raised two grounds for relief in his successive petition: (1) the state committed a Brady violation for failing to disclose the victim’s alleged recantation during pretrial interviews; and (2) actual innocence based on the alleged recantation. These two grounds were also the basis of his 2019 petition and subsequent motion for new trial. Notwithstanding the effects of res judicata, we find no abuse of discretion by the trial court in summarily denying his successive petition.",No error,"(17) Our review of Murphy’s petition and exhibits reveal that these
allegations are unsupported by any evidence. First, the arguments raised in the petition do not cite to any evidence outside the record. And the exhibits filed under seal do not contain any information supporting Murphy’s arguments. We note that the state opposed Murphy’s petition by discrediting the victim’s mother’s sworn statement, but as the trial court correctly noted, “the record being reviewed by this court does not contain such a statement.” Accordingly, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that Murphy failed to establish any Brady violation.

(37) Murphy does not contend that a new right has been recognized and retroactively applies to him; he contends that he was unavoidably prevented from discovering new evidence. However, the “unavoidably prevented” requirement in R.C. 2953.23(A)(1) mirrors the “unavoidably prevented” requirement in Crim.R. 33(B). State v. Waddy, 2016-Ohio-4911, 68 N.E.3d 381, ¶ 27 (10th Dist.). Accordingly, for the same reasons stated in finding no abuse of discretion by the trial court in denying Murphy’s motion for leave, we also find no abuse of discretion in denying his successive petition for postconviction relief without conducting a hearing. Murphy has failed to demonstrate that he was unavoidably prevented from discovering the victim’s alleged recantation to permit a trial court to consider a successive postconviction relief.

recent trial court proceedings. Pursuant to a due process analysis, we cannot conclude that Reid was denied due process or that the State failed to disclose material evidence favorable to him. As previously (and repeatedly) noted, at the time of trial, Reid was aware of the 911 recordings and of the existence of the vehicle which he claims to have driven around the time of the incident. As this Court noted above, “the information Defendant seeks regarding recorded 911 calls to police and the vehicle police impounded is not newly discovered, because it was either provided to defense counsel at trial or referenced in police reports provided to defense counsel at trial.” Reid, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 24672, 2012-Ohio-1659, ¶ 10. Since the evidence upon which Reid relies was not newly discovered, his motion was barred of res judicata. 4 For the
foregoing reasons, Reid was not entitled to a hearing on his motion. In other words, the trial court properly overruled Reid’s motion to reinstate his motion for leave to file a motion for a new trial.

The test regarding prosecutorial misconduct in closing arguments is whether the remarks were improper and, if so, whether they prejudicially affected substantial rights of the defendant. See State v. Smith, 14 Ohio St.3d 13, 14, 470 N.E.2d 883 (1984), citing United States v. Dorr, 636 F.2d 117 (5th Cir.1981). Prosecutorial misconduct does not amount to plain error unless it is clear that the conduct was improper and that without the misconduct the outcome of the trial would have been otherwise. See, e.g., State v. Slagle, 65 Ohio St.3d 597, 605, 605 N.E.3d 916 (1992); State v. Boles, 190 Ohio App.3d 431, 2010-Ohio-5503, 942 N.E.2d 417, ¶ 51 (6th Dist.2010).",Harmless error,"A prosecutor’s use of “I believe” and “I think” to preface credibility arguments should be avoided. See Williams, 99 Ohio St.3d 439, 2003-Ohio-4164, 793 N.E.2d 446, at ¶ 45-46. For example, in this case, the prosecutor argued, “I believe that Miss Johnson has no reason to make this up,” implying personal knowledge. This problem is circumvented by arguing instead, “there is nothing in the evidence to suggest that Miss Johnson had a reason to make this up.” Similarly, the prosecutor could have appropriately commented on Jones’s potential bias based on her familial relationship with Rouzier without personalizing the argument. But the prosecutor did personalize the argument, stating instead, “Your honor, I believe Miss Jones is trying to protect her son in this situation.”
{¶19} Whether improper prosecutorial commentary during closing argument rises to reversible error involves a separate analysis. Smith, 14 Ohio St.3d
at 14-15, 470 N.E.2d 883. To that end, in a bench trial, the trial court is presumed to rely on only relevant, material evidence in arriving at its judgment. See State v. White, 15 Ohio St.2d 146, 151, 239 N.E.2d 65 (1968), cited in State v. Beck, 2016-Ohio-8122, 75 N.E.3d 899, ¶ 28 (1st Dist.). That presumption is not rebutted by the record, which instead contains the trial court’s oral summary of the admissible evidence that supported each conviction. Further, in this case, the defendant did not object, waiving all but plain error. When we review the challenged comments in the context of the entire closing argument and the substantial evidence presented at the trial, we conclude that those comments did not affect the trial’s result and constitute
plain error. Accordingly we overrule the second assignment of error. ",,prosecutorial misconduct,Winkler,Robert C. Winkler,"Myers, Crouse","Candace C. Crouse,Beth A. Myers",Joseph T. Deters,Joseph T.

Sutton also cites similar underlying issues and arguments for review:
A trial court errs when it makes factual findings that are not supported by competent, credible evidence. The state violates Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), when it suppresses the accounts of police officers who directly contradict the state’s trial evidence.
A trial court errs in failing to consider the weakness of the state’s case at trial in determining whether suppressed evidence is material under Brady.
A trial court errs when it discounts exculpatory evidence by making adverse credibility determinations, thereby invading the province of a jury.
A trial court errs when it fails to consider the cumulative weight of newly discovered evidence in adjudicating a new-trial motion.
Based on the congruence of the facts, arguments, evidence, and complicity claims underlying the convictions of the appellants, we combine the assigned errors for analysis.",Harmful error,"The three elements of a Brady violation have been met in this case. The material evidence in issue is favorable to the accused because it is exculpatory or impeaching. The evidence was willfully or inadvertently suppressed by the state.  Appellants were prejudiced by the suppression. McGuire, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 105732, 2018-Ohio-1390, at ¶ 18.
We further find that pursuant to Crim. R. 33, appellants were denied a fair trial where the state failed to provide exculpatory evidence that materially affected Phillips’s and Sutton’s substantial rights and that the newly discovered material evidence could not have been discovered with reasonable diligence.
Additionally, we find that the record affirmatively supports that Phillips and Sutton were prejudiced and therefore were not afforded a fair trial.
The decision of the trial court is hereby reversed, appellants’ convictions are vacated, and this case is remanded for a new trial according to law and consistent with this court’s opinion. It is ordered that appellants recover from appellee costs herein taxed. The court finds there were reasonable grounds for this appeal.

{¶ 7} THE STATE VIOLATED THE DEFENDANT'S DUE PROCESS RIGHTS IN
FAILING TO COMPLY WITH BRADY V. MARYLAND.
{¶ 8} Ward argues the state improperly withheld favorable evidence from the
defense in violation of the United States Supreme Court's decision in Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S. Ct. 1194 (1963). Specifically, Ward argues that the state suppressed favorable evidence when it did not produce GPS records that showed the location of Ward's patrol cruiser during the alleged sexual offenses. ",No error,"After reviewing the record, we find that the state did not violate Brady for
multiple reasons. The GPS records in question showed the location of Ward's patrol cruiser at various times. It is undisputed that the documents showing the coordinates were public record and thus available to Ward at any point prior to trial. In fact, Ward asserted in his motion for a new trial that he had made a public records request for records of his GPS coordinates that he now claims were suppressed by the state. See State v. Stepp, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2020-05-062, 2020-Ohio-6901, ¶ 22 (no Brady violation where nothing
prevented the appellant from filing a public records request for the information alleged to have been suppressed); State v. Davis, 5th Dist. Licking No. 2008-CA-16, 2008-Ohio-6841, (no Brady violation where the records were publicly available and appellant could have obtained access to them); and Matthews v. Ishee, 486 F.3d 883, 890-91 (6th Cir.2007) (concluding that documents in question were public information so that the government could not have ""disclosed"" information ""readily available to the defense"").

misconduct in failing to investigate exculpatory evidence and instead directing
a witness to create a new statement[.]

In his second assignment of error, Mr. Fortune argues that prosecutorial misconduct
deprived him of a fair trial. Specifically, he argues that the prosecutor engaged in misconduct when he failed to have the police investigate the younger sister’s claim that D.M. and M.F. lied and, instead, instructed D.M. to write a more detailed statement. We reject his argument.

{¶39} The record reflects that Mr. Fortune discovered the younger sister’s writings on his
computer about a month before trial and turned them over to his counsel. His counsel then gave the writings to their private investigator, and he repeatedly interviewed the younger sister. The defense did not provide her writings to the prosecution until less than two weeks before trial. The prosecutor then met with D.M. and M.F. to discuss what the younger sister had written. Rather than provide the younger sister’s writings to Captain Lemmon, the prosecutor ultimately asked D.M. to write another statement. 

According to Mr. Fortune, the prosecutor ignored his duty to pursue exculpatory evidence when he failed to give the younger sister’s writings to the police and
instead told D.M. to provide additional evidence. ",No error,"The defense had access to the younger sister’s writings two weeks before the prosecutor and used that time to investigate her claims. Mr. Fortune chose not to provide those writings to the police himself, and it is unclear what additional exculpatory evidence, if any, he believes the police would have uncovered had the prosecutor asked Captain Lemmon to investigate the writings. 
Because Mr. Fortune forfeited his argument and, in any event, has not attempted to explain how he was substantially prejudiced by the prosecutor’s actions, this Court rejects his argument.

discretion in refusing to strike Juror No. 6 for cause because the juror had a first cousin that worked for the Belmont County Sheriff’s Office.

In his second assignment of error, Appellant contends the trial court erred
in allowing evidence to go before the jury of other alleged rape/sex acts committed by him on the same victim since he was only charged on one count.

In his third assignment of error, Appellant maintains the trial court abused
its discretion in denying defense counsel the ability to conduct further cross-examination of BCI DNA forensic scientist Devine pertaining to sperm.

In his fourth assignment of error, Appellant asserts the trial court erred in
instructing the jury by not fully defining “force.”

In his fifth assignment of error, Appellant references R.C. 2941.1419 in
arguing that the trial court erred in instructing the jury on the specification by not including the age requirement.

In his sixth assignment of error, Appellant alleges the prosecutor misstated
the law during rebuttal. In his seventh assignment of error, Appellant asserts the prosecutor improperly commented on his credibility. Because both of these assignments focus on alleged errors committed by the prosecutor during closing argument, we will address them together.

In his eighth assignment of error, Appellant maintains his sentence is
contrary to law.

In his ninth assignment of error, Appellant stresses his conviction should be
reversed because of “cumulative error” and “potential” ineffective assistance of counsel.",No error,"As we find no error in any of Appellant’s assignments, his final assignment
based on cumulative error clearly has no merit. Id. Likewise, Appellant’s empty allegation concerning a “potential” ineffective assistance of counsel claim also has no merit. The record fails to establish that trial counsel was ineffective and Appellant clearly fails to demonstrate the two-part test for ineffective assistance of counsel, namely: (1) that trial counsel’s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonable representation; and (2) that prejudice arose from the deficient performance.

Weikart,Ryan P. Weikart,Fowler,Roger,Roger D. Fowler,White,2019,Sexual violence,Gross sexual imposition ,,,checked,Female,3.5 years,,2019,Examination of witnesses,"Assignment 2: The trial court erred when it allowed an expert witness for the State to testify, over objection, to matters beyond the scope of the expert’s written report. Crim.R. 16. (Defendant’s Ex. C; Tr. Vol. 3, pp. 597-604.) 

Issue with questioning of expert by prosecutor: {¶38} Appellant argues that Dr. McPherson’s answer went to a main issue in this case: whether A.W. may have viewed pornography because she was a victim of sexual
abuse. Appellant claims the testimony had the effect of bolstering A.W.’s credibility with the jury, by supporting the idea that she was not fabricating her allegation of abuse to avoid being punished by her father for viewing pornography. The state counters that Dr. McPherson did not actually answer the question asked by the prosecutor; whether it would be surprising that a child victim of sexual abuse would view pornography. Instead, Dr. McPherson offered a general observation that an older child might seek out information when they encounter something they do not understand rather than one aimed specifically at A.W.’s conduct and the allegations of sexual abuse. ",Harmless error,"{¶40} While Appellant is incorrect that this line of questioning should result in exclusion of the expert’s report, we do find the question asked by the state is problematic for two reasons. As already stated, it goes beyond the scope of Dr. McPherson’s report, hampering defense counsel’s ability to prepare an adequate defense as to this issue. Second, depending on Dr. McPherson’s answer, it could be seen as an improper attempt to bolster A.W.’s credibility. 

Having a child abuse expert testify that A.W. was watching pornography because she was abused could potentially improperly influence the jury on the matter.
{¶41} However, the record shows Dr. McPherson’s actual answer to the question was clearly general in nature. He spoke generally about the likelihood of children in specific age groups seeking information on the internet. He did not mention A.W. or relate his opinion to the case at issue.
{¶42} Applying the analysis established in Harris, the question posed by the state regarding A.W.’s pornography viewing was improper, as it exceeded the scope of the expert’s report. However, Dr. McPherson’s response was general in nature and did not specifically address A.W.’s conduct in this case. Appellant has not demonstrated that he was prejudiced by the question or that this single question affected the verdict. When we view the record without including this question by the state and Dr. McPherson’s general observation in response, the record is replete with evidence presented by the state to support the verdict. Testimony from multiple witnesses was presented to the jury. Most
importantly, the victim, herself, testified in this matter fairly extensively and addressed the issue in question both on direct examination and on the defense’s cross-examination. Hence, while it appears the trial court erred in allowing the state to question Dr. McPherson about a matter not addressed in his report, this error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. 

This record reveals the question and generalized answer did not affect
the substantial rights of Appellant. The remaining evidence presented at trial established Appellant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Appellant is not entitled to a new trial on this issue. His second assignment of error is without merit and is overruled. ",Resentencing,harmless error,J. Waite,Cheryl L. Waite,"J. Robb, J. D'Apolito","Carol Ann Robb ,David A.

He cannot reasonably argue that he was unavoidably preventing from learning of these alleged facts. Taylor’s claims that the search of his apartment violated the Fourth Amendment due to untrue statements in the search warrant affidavit and that the State perpetrated a fraud on the court similarly were based on evidence available prior to and at trial. With the record before us, any claim that Taylor was unavoidably prevented from discovering the facts underlying his petitions for postconviction relief would be frivolous.

The State: This unknown male, [Detective] Jordan tells me that he does get a CODIS hit, and it’s a guy that he knew from high school and so based on how he walks he knows that wasn’t him.

Defendant-Appellant Was Denied Due Process When the State
Failed to Preserve Evidence and Failed to Disclose DNA Evidence. 

 Carr’s initial argument about the destruction is that the evidence in the car was materially exculpatory because the testimony clearly indicated that a central issue in the case was who pulled the trigger – Carr or Burdette. Specifically, Carr (who testified at trial) claimed he had dropped Burdette off on Free Pike and never was in Russell’s car.  

{¶ 59} Regarding this issue, Carr contends that the State committed prosecutorial misconduct by failing to notify him or his counsel of the destruction of the car. According to Carr, this undermined his ability to adequately defend. He further notes that nothing in the record indicates that the State affirmatively disclosed the destruction of the car. Alternatively, Carr asserts that the State violated Crim.R. 16(B)(1)(f) by failing to disclose the car’s exculpatory nature.

 {¶ 67} Carr’s final argument is as follows:
The Trial Court Erred When It Denied Mr. Carr's Motion to Dismiss
Due to the State's Failure to Timely Disclose Evidence, and Mr. Carr Was
Denied Due Process as a Result.

¶ 68} This argument is based on the State’s failure to submit DNA submission 015 until two days before trial (the Friday before trial began on Monday). According to Carr, the trial court erred by failing to determine whether the State’s failure was calculated
or willful. Carr further contends that he should have been given the chance to submit this DNA sample to multiple experts of his own choosing.",No error,"{¶ 43} For the reasons mentioned, Carr’s argument as to the materially
exculpatory nature of the evidence is without merit.  

64: Even if this were otherwise, there is no evidence that
the State failed to disclose the destruction of the car, nor is there any evidence indicating
exactly when the prosecutors either learned about it or informed Carr's counsel.

{¶ 65} Furthermore, for the reasons previously discussed, the evidence was not material, and there is no reasonable probability that the trial’s result would have been different if the destruction had been disclosed. 

90: Based on the preceding discussion, we find no error with respect to the disclosure of the DNA evidence.

The appellant had a single assignment of error where he says he was denied due process when the State failed to preserve evidence and failed to disclose DNA evidence. 

The evidence in question - the car in which the murder took place - was destroyed. The appellant argues that the car was the site of various evidentiary issues and its destruction prevented the defense from taking photographs from ""his preferred positions and angles to illuminate his defense."" (page 11). While the State argued that the evidence was not exculpatory since the state disclosed to the defense over 90 photographs depicting the interior and exterior of the victim's car. 

The failure to disclose DNA evidence is considered to be an oversight of the Crime Lab, which is not a division of the Prosecutor's Office. The prosecutors and defense both agreed that the failure to disclose this evidence in a timely matter is not at the fault of the prosecutors.

[1.] The trial court improperly instructed the jury on aiding and
abetting in violation of appellant's due process rights
guaranteed by the United States and Ohio Constitutions.

[2.] Appellant was deprived of the effective assistance of trial
counsel in violation of appellant's rights under the Sixth and
Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution,
and Section 10 and 16, Article I of the Ohio Constitution.

[3.] The trial court violated appellant's rights to due process
and a fair trial when it entered a judgment of conviction based
on insufficient evidence and against the manifest weight of the
evidence in violation of appellant's rights under the United
States and Ohio Constitutions.

ACTUAL PLACE WHERE PM IS MENTIONED: 

{¶ 48} Webster's third allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel is his trial counsel's failure to object to the prosecutor's improper remarks during opening statement. The test for prosecutorial misconduct based on a prosecutor's statements to the jury ""is whether the remarks were improper and, if so, whether they prejudicially affected substantial rights of the defendant."" State v. Smith, 14 Ohio St.3d 13, 14 (1984), citing
United States v. Dorr, 636 F.2d 117 (5th Cir.1981). "" '[T]he touchstone of due process analysis in cases of alleged prosecutorial misconduct is the fairness of the trial, not the culpability of the prosecutor.' "" State v. Wilkerson, 10th Dist. No. 01AP-1127, 2002-Ohio5416, ¶ 38, quoting Smith v. Phillips, 455 U.S. 209, 219 (1982). ",Did not reach error/conduct did not result in prejudice,"Based on the foregoing reasons, the trial court did not plainly err in instructing the jury on aiding and abetting, Webster did not receive the ineffective assistance of counsel, and the sufficiency of the evidence and the manifest weight of the evidence support Webster's convictions of aggravated burglary, kidnapping, aggravated murder, murder, felonious assault, having weapons while under disability and the accompanying firearm specifications. Having overruled Webster's three assignments of error, we affirm the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas.

RE THE PM:

{¶ 50} Even assuming, for purposes of argument, that the prosecutor's statements were improper, it does not necessarily follow that Webster's counsel was deficient in failing to object to the prosecutor's statements. Counsel may choose, as a tactical decision, not to object to the prosecutor's opening statement even if the prosecutor has engaged in
prosecutorial misconduct. State v. Shine-Johnson, 10th Dist. No. 17AP-194, 2018-Ohio3347, ¶ 121, citing State v. Gumm, 73 Ohio St.3d 413, 428 (1995) (defense counsel's failure to object to prosecutorial misconduct ""does not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel per se, as that failure may be justified as a tactical decision""). Moreover, Webster does not identify how he was prejudiced by the prosecutor's statement other than to assert generally that the statement must have affected the jury. However, the trial court instructed the jury that opening and closing statements were not evidence and further instructed the jury to  No. 20AP-171 17 make their findings ""without bias, sympathy, or prejudice."" (Tr. Vol. 6 at 1243.) The jury is presumed to follow these instructions. State v. Fudge, 10th Dist.

{¶ 55} Mr. Williams, for example, now protests that the state elicited and referred to information that A.P. ""was a mother and a breast cancer survivor"" and activist. Appellant's Brief at 11. But that sort of background information is not wholly and intrinsically out of bounds. Compare Smith, 2002-Ohio-6659, at ¶ 46 (""since the testimony merely elicited background information and was 'not overly emotional or directed to the penalty to be imposed' [in the capital case], the remarks do not constitute plain error"") (citations omitted). A.P.'s status as a mother was reflected in the electronic messages to which both sides cited, explained certain relevant scheduling decisions she made, and was further raised in relevant conversation with Mr. Williams and in testimony about her brief My Little Pony conversation with Mr. Crook's daughter (who was about her own daughter's age). See, e.g., Tr. Vol. II at 47, 50, 60. She also testified that her desire to see her daughter and her successful battle against cancer informed her response to Mr. Williams's conduct. Id. at 69 (""all I could think about was my daughter and staying alive so I could get home to her alive""); 70 (""If I just let him do what he wanted, then he would let me go. And I kept thinking, like: You didn't beat cancer just to die here in this rape cave""). Testimony as to the nature of A.P.'s discussions with Mr. Williams on the day at issue, including their discussion of her cancer survivor status, id. at 56 (""We talked about my journey through cancer and just life""), were also relevant. We do not find that A.P.'s maternal or cancer survivor status (or similar background about A.P.'s devotion to her job as a make-up artist concentrating on weddings, which responsibilities she said figured into why she didn't report the conduct the following day, see, e.g., id. at 75-76, 79) was abused here. The trial court's instructions, moreover, cautioned the jury: ""[d]o not allow any consideration of sympathy for or prejudice against anyone to influence your deliberations."" Tr. Vol. III at 147. We see no obvious error regarding the use of this testimony, but in any event we find no reasonable probability (so as to undermine confidence in the verdict) that the jury would have reached a different result had objections been made and sustained.


{¶ 58} Mr. Williams also takes issue with the prosecutor's inquiry into and discussions of the nature of his business. Appellant's Brief at 12-13. But Mr. Williams testified on direct examination that he had a business purpose for meeting A.P. at the bar, see Tr. Vol. III at 19 (""So I was really just kind of like more of a business relationship with her. So when we kind of like established that we were going to meet up, I asked Kevin to come with me for that reason""; his plan was to ""talk a little bit about business. And I was actually trying to hook Kevin and her up""). The nature of Mr. Williams's business and his interest in A.P. was appropriate ground for cross-examination. And our review of his responses leaves us still uncertain about what, precisely, his business entailed. See, e.g., id. at 13 (""I own an energy company called Yocum Telecom. Credit card processing.""); 33 (""It's kind of hard to sum up. Basically, I'm a re-seller of like all the major like cell phone companies, TV companies. We also partner with AEP in Cincinnati * * * Basically, I resell their services at a discounted price""); 34 (on typical work day, ""I do a lot of meetings. I have like Starbucks, Panera's. I meet with a lot of other people. I also train and teach people how they can start up their home-based business on the side,"" teaching them ""[h]ow to acquire customers, how to show the customers the savings""). And according to the trial transcript, it was Mr. Williams who introduced the word ""pyramid"" into this discussion: asked whether ""these customers * * * kind of report underneath you?"", he answered, ""Is it pyramid? Is that what you're trying to get at?"" Id. at 35. We find no plain error involving the questions into or comment on Mr. Williams's business operations.

Summation: 
{¶ 56} In this regard, we note that the portion of the state's closing argument block quoted at page 12 of Appellant's Brief (starting: ""It's because she has a daughter[,]"" and continuing through references to A.P.'s work and cancer-fighting activities) were offered not as a bald ""request for guilty verdicts,"" compare Appellant's Brief at 12, but as part of an argument regarding A.P.'s motivations for reporting the conduct and undergoing the necessarily invasive medical examinations: A.P. ""has no motive to lie"" and ""gets nothing out of this,"" the prosecutor urged, so ""[w]hy go through all of this * * * ? It's because she has a daughter [etc.]."" Tr. Vol. III at 135-36. We do not find obvious error in the lack of a trial court interruption there, and we do not find any reasonable probability that the argument affected the result.

{¶ 60} Mr. Williams invokes a variety of other statements from the prosecutors' closing arguments.


[5.] The trial court committed plain error by permitting
testimony from a state expert in violation of Ohio Criminal
Rule 16(K), thereby depriving appellant of due process of law
as guaranteed by the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth
Amendments to the United States Constitution and Article I,
Section 10 of the Ohio Constitution.",Harmless error,"{¶ 54} The matters that Mr. Williams now claims as prosecutorial misconduct but to which he did not object at trial do not qualify as obvious error (including various unraised evidentiary issues now garbed as misconduct allegations), or do not present a reasonable probability of a different outcome, or both.

Examination of witnesses:
{¶ 55} ...We see no obvious error regarding the use of this testimony, but in any event we find no reasonable probability (so as to undermine confidence in the verdict) that the jury would have reached a different result had objections been made and sustained.

{¶ 58} Mr. Williams also takes issue with the prosecutor's inquiry into and discussions of the nature of his business. Appellant's Brief at 12-13. But Mr. Williams testified on direct examination that he had a business purpose for meeting A.P. at the bar, see Tr.

Summation: 
{¶ 56} In this regard, we note that the portion of the state's closing argument block quoted at page 12 of Appellant's Brief (starting: ""It's because she has a daughter[,]"" and continuing through references to A.P.'s work and cancer-fighting activities) were offered not as a bald ""request for guilty verdicts,"" compare Appellant's Brief at 12, but as part of an argument regarding A.P.'s motivations for reporting the conduct and undergoing the necessarily invasive medical examinations: A.P. ""has no motive to lie"" and ""gets nothing out of this,"" the prosecutor urged, so ""[w]hy go through all of this * * * ? It's because she has a daughter [etc.]."" Tr. Vol. III at 135-36. We do not find obvious error in the lack of a trial court interruption there, and we do not find any reasonable probability that the argument affected the result.

{¶ 59} We also find no plain error in the prosecutor's closing argument that Mr. Williams was ""control[ling],"" (and we specifically reject any suggestion that there is a reasonable probability that the outcome of this case was affected by prosecution comments that he referred to his ""roommates"" as his ""tenants"" and ""has the house professionally cleaned[,]"" Appellant's Brief at 13-14, citing Tr. Vol. III at 134; brief's emphasis omitted).

{¶ 60}...In any event, no prosecution question or statement specified in this appeal and to which the defense did not object at trial rises to the level of creating plain error because the trial court did not intervene of its own accord.


{¶ 61} Mr. Williams does in his first assignment of error identify one prosecution
statement as to which the defense objected and the trial court incorrectly overruled the
objection. The prosecutor was out of bounds when, in the first segment of the state's closing argument, he proclaimed: ""I have no doubt from the evidence presented over the
last two days that [A.P.] did fight."" Tr. Vol. III at 83. ""An attorney may not express a
personal belief or opinion as to the credibility of a witness."" Davis, 2008-Ohio-2, at
No. 19AP-824 23
¶ 232, citing State v. Williams, 79 Ohio St.3d 1, 12 (1997). In overruling the objection, the
trial court did say, ""[t]his is argument[,]"" Tr. Vol. III at 83, but the objection should have
been sustained.

HARMLESS ERROR RULING:
{¶ 62} We review this issue under the general standard for prosecutorial misconduct. Because the conduct in this instance was improper, we must determine ""whether it prejudicially affected [the defendant's] substantial rights."" State v. LaMar, 95 Ohio St.3d 181, 2002-Ohio-2128, ¶ 121, citing State v. Smith, 14 Ohio St.3d 13, 14 (1984). ""The touchstone of this analysis 'is the fairness of the trial, not the culpability of the prosecutor.' "" Id. (citation omitted). ""We will not deem a trial unfair if, in the context of the entire trial, it appears clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury would have found the defendant guilty even without the improper comments."" Id., citing State v. Tresh, 90 Ohio St.3d 460, 464 (2001); Smith.

{¶ 63} Here, as in LaMar, ""the misconduct * * * did not pervade the trial to such a degree that there was a denial of due process."" Id. at ¶ 149. Here, as there, ""[t]he fact that the prosecutor engaged in some improper argument * * * does not warrant reversal"" where the remarks did not prejudicially affect the defendant's substantial rights. Id. at
¶ 168 (citation omitted). In considering the effect of the remark in the context of the entire trial, ""[w]e must also view the prosecutor's closing argument in its entirety when determining prejudice."" Id.
{¶ 64} Our review of the trial transcript, including our scrutiny of closing
arguments, leads us to conclude that it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury would have found Mr. Williams guilty without the comment to which the defense objected. (And it does not at all excuse the misconduct to note that it may have presaged certain vigorous arguments by defense counsel. ""I'm here to tell you the truth,"" defense counsel said, Tr. Vol. III at 94, before later arguing that A.P. ""lied to you some more,"" id.
at 105, and [perhaps ambiguously] that Mr. Williams ""couldn't have been more honest,"" id. at 116.) In the context of the whole trial that juxtaposed A.P.'s account with Mr. Williams's own testimony, the jury was well positioned to reach its verdict. And the
prosecutor's ill-advised remark did not characterize the state's closing generally. The trial
court did identify that specific remark as ""argument,"" and later instructed the jury at least
twice that argument is not evidence. Considering the remark in the context of the state's
No. 19AP-824 24
closing argument as a whole and in light of the entire trial record, we echo LaMar in
determining that ""we see no basis for reversing [the] conviction based on the prosecutor's
comments."" Compare LaMar, 2002-Ohio-2128, at ¶ 168.

{¶93} Appellant, in his third assignment of error, argues that argues that appellee, during closing arguments, engaged in prosecutorial misconduct

Appellant, in the case sub judice, specifically argues that the prosecutor engaged in misconduct by eliciting testimony from appellant regarding his pending criminal indictment in Franklin County. Appellant notes that the prosecutor argued during closing arguments that “[i]n this case, [Appellant] knew he was selling meth. It was his profession, Sells drugs, sells meth, sell weed. Does this every day.” Transcript at 396- 397. Appellant also notes that later the prosecutor stated “[w]hen you are dealing in hundreds of dollars in weed- this is not like medical marijuana. This is I am a drug dealer. This is my profession. Whatever commodity, drug dealing is the profession at that level.” Transcript at 406. According to appellant, these actions constituted prosecutorial misconduct.",Did not reach error/conduct did not result in prejudice,"{¶90} Appellant now contends that the trial court erred by allowing the State to elicit testimony on cross-examination from appellant regarding his unrelated pending criminal indictment in Franklin County, Ohio. We note that appellant’s counsel objected to such questioning, arguing that it was irrelevant and that appellant had a Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.

{¶91} We note, however, that trial counsel never instructed appellant not to answer and that appellant never asserted his Fifth Amendment right against self incrimination. Moreover, appellant, via his own testimony that he was a small time drug  Muskingum County, Case No. CT2019-0050 11
dealer, opened the door to questioning about his drug trafficking. As noted by appellee, appellant “cannot voluntarily testify in great detail on direct examination about marijuana trafficking and then attempt to limit the State’s questioning as to the exact same matter.” Furthermore, assuming, arguendo, that it was error to allow such evidence, we cannot say that appellant was prejudiced in any manner based on the evidence regarding the buy made by the C.I. and that fact that appellant admitted being a drug dealer. There was overwhelming evidence of appellant’s guilt and any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.
{¶92} Appellant’s first and second assignments of error are, therefore, overruled. 

We concur with appellee that even if such statements were improper, they were not so prejudicial as to deprive appellant of a fair trial and did not constitute plain error. 
There was overwhelming evidence presented at trial supporting appellant’s conviction. At trial appellant testified that he was a drug dealer, he was actually caught delivering narcotics to a CI and had the pre-recorded drug funds when he was arrested. Because there was overwhelming evidence presented at trial against appellant, we cannot say that appellant was deprived of a fair trial.

5. The trial court erred in allowing several instances of improper
character evidence and other act evidence depriving the appellant the
right to due process and a fair trial.

In his third assignment of error, Rodriguez claims he was denied a
fair trial because of prosecutorial misconduct. He asserts that there were three such instances. First, he claims it was improper for the state to argue to the jury, for purposes of the sexually violent predator specifications, that it should consider evidence of counts for which he was found not guilty. Second, he claims the state impermissibly revealed that Rodriguez was incarcerated during the trial. Third, Rodriguez claims the state impermissibly cross-examined him regarding his past
sexual activity
----------

In his fifth assignment of error, Rodriguez argues that the state
improperly presented instances of character and other acts evidence by introducing evidence of his domestic violence convictions as well as evidence from his social media accounts. 

Rodriguez next claims that the state improperly questioned him
regarding two specific incidents with police.
Prior to the state’s questioning regarding the incidents, Rodriguez
was asked, during direct examination, whether he had “been in trouble before” the domestic violence incidents with B.S
",No error,"Rodriguez claims that it was misconduct for the state to argue that the
jury should consider as evidence for the sexually violent predator specifications, evidence that pertained to the counts for which he was found not guilty.  There is no merit to this challenge because Rodriguez fails to demonstrate prejudice.

Rodriguez argues that it was misconduct for the prosecutor to reveal
to the jury that he was incarcerated at the time of trial. Here, Rodriguez does not demonstrate that unjust prejudice resulted from the prosecutor’s reference to his jail status. To the contrary, his claim is merely that the reference “may have influenced the jury.”

Rodriguez argues the third instance of prosecutorial misconduct
occurred during his cross-examination where, over objection, the state inquired into his past sexual activity.  Because Rodriguez had previously offered evidence regarding his past sexual history, the state did not violate the statutory limitation regarding specific instances of his sexual activity with its inquiry. See Howell at ¶ 29.
We overrule the third assignment of error.

**

(23) In the case at hand, Magwood argues that the state failed to disclose relevant information relating to Cleveland Police Detective Morris Vowell (“Detective Vowell”), who took T.J.’s statement as part of the investigation in this case. At the December 21, 2018 hearing, Magwood introduced into evidence Detective Vowell’s 2011 internal affairs report that the state disclosed as Brady material in another matter. The gist of the report was that Detective Vowell had been indicted for using a police computer for personal reasons. Ultimately, the charges against Detective Vowell were dismissed. Magwood argued that the “information in question goes to the heart of the professional integrity and credibility of the investigating detective in this case,” and the state’s failure to disclose the information deprived Magwood of the opportunity to impeach Detective Vowell.",No error,"(27)  ""Upon review, we find that Magwood’s Brady claim lacks merit,

2. Straughan argues in his second assignment of error that the trial court committed plain error in the self-defense instruction it gave the jury, in failing to hold a hearing on Straughan’s hearing impairment, and in failing to hold a hearing concerning an incident involving a juror talking to a prosecutor.

3. Straughan argues in his third assignment of error that the State engaged in multiple instances of prosecutorial misconduct that deprived him of a fair trial. Specifically, Straughan points to instances of what he characterizes as the prosecutor making comments contrary to Ohio law concerning an individual’s right to carry a firearm, the prosecutor displaying a screenshot of a Facebook page that was ultimately deemed inadmissible, and the prosecutor wearing a plastic toy gun on his hip and pointing it at Straughan. 
",No error,"FIRST ERROR:
PAGE 10 P25: We conclude that the State presented sufficient evidence, if believed to support a finding of guilt on the charge of violating R.C. 2923.162(A)(3) and 2923.162(C)(2).  
PAGE 12 P 30: we conclude the State presented sufficient evidence, there was evidence presented that the victim was moving away from Straughan when Straughan shot at the victim. This would support that Straughan did not have a bona fide belief that he was in immediate danger of death or great bodily harm at the time he utilized deadly force, there was also evidence from which it could be concluded that Straughan could have retreated. We conclude that the State presented sufficient evidence to disprove Straughan’s self-defense claim.    
PAGE 14 P34: This Court will not overturn a conviction on a manifest weight challenge only because the jury found the testimony of certain witnesses to be credible. 
PAGE 17 P 42: we conclude that Straughan has not demonstrated that the trial court committed error, plain or otherwise, in instructing the jury on self-defense. Despite Straughan’s claim to the contrary, the instruction was quite lengthy and detailed. Thus, Straughan’s argument is overruled. 

SECOND ERROR:
PAGE 19 P 46: Straughan’s level of hearing impairment was not documented in the record nor were the accommodations made by the trial court, we cannot say that Straughan has demonstrated that the trial court committed plain error in failing to sua sponte conduct an evidentiary hearing concerning his hearing impairment.
PAGE 21 P50: Straughan’s counsel did not merely fail to object, he repeatedly affirmatively stated that he had no objection. we conclude that the ability to challenge this issue was waived by defense counsel. “Waiver is the intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right.

THIRD ERROR:
PAGE 23 P57: we fail to see how any misconduct by the prosecutor affected Straughan’s substantial rights given Straughan’s counsel did not object to the act of the prosecutor wearing a toy gun and pointing it at Straughan. 
PAGE 24 P59: It is not clear from the record that the jury could see the post and ultimately it was not admitted into evidence. Thus, Straughan cannot demonstrate that he was
prejudiced by any misconduct that may have occurred. 

FOURTH ERROR:
PAGE 25 P63: With respect to the self-defense instruction, based upon the reasoning above, we cannot say that Straughan’s counsel was deficient in failing to object to the jury instruction; we determined that the instruction did not amount to reversible or plain error. 
PAGE  26 P64: As to trial counsel’s failure to request a hearing with respect to the juror’s contact with the prosecutor, we cannot say that Straughan has demonstrated that his attorney was deficient and that contact presented a likelihood of affecting the verdict.  
PAGE 26 P65: Throughout the vast majority of the trial, neither Straughan nor his counsel expressed that Straughan had any problems in comprehending the proceedings, we cannot say that the record demonstrates that he was “seriously hearing-impaired” such that a hearing was required. Therefore, Straughan’s
counsel could not be ineffective in failing to request one.

40) The final category of attorney error asserted by appellant pertains to pretrial discovery and the prosecutors’ remarks during the trial. Appellant argues that the prosecution withheld interview notes of the initial interview of R.Y., and his trial counsel failed to identify the omission of these notes in the discovery produced by the state. 

Appellant also argues that the prosecutor opined on the truthfulness of witnesses, in violation of Berger v. United States, 295 U.S. 78, 55 S.Ct. 629, 79 L.Ed. 1314 (1935).

Frey,Powell,Carlin,Carlin Powell,Black,2019,Sexual violence,rape,"rape, kidnapping, corruption of a minor ",,checked,Female,10.5,,2019,"Brady violation,Other or unknown","Powell’s first argument is that the inconsistencies between the
victims’ statements to the police immediately after the rapes and their trial testimony establish that the state relied on perjured evidence to obtain his conviction. Indeed, “A prosecutor’s knowing use of perjured testimony is a violation of due process and requires reversal of a criminal conviction if there is ‘any reasonable likelihood that the false testimony could have affected the judgment of the jury.’ 

As a variation on this argument, Powell parses the tampering with evidence statute, R.C. 2921.12, to assert that the witnesses and the prosecution tampered with the evidence to secure his conviction. He proposes that the witnesses and the prosecutors made and used records and documents, knowing them to be false to mislead the jury. With so many inconsistencies in the two victims’ statements, the state could not escape the conclusion that the victims were lying, but nonetheless the state presented the lies. 

Powell also argues that the state must have conducted multiple interviews with D.E. but withheld exculpatory evidence by not releasing the interview(s).",No error,"Generally, the falsity of a sworn statement is not shown by proof on an unsworn contradictory statement, because credit must be given to what a witness says under oath rather than what the witness said when not under oath. Richardson v. State, 45 Ohio App. 46, 49, 186 N.E. 510 (8th Dist.1933). In State v. Shedwick, 8th Dist.
Cuyahoga No. 71749, 1997 Ohio App.LEXIS 5227 (Nov. 20, 1997), a witness testified in contradiction to an earlier written statement, and the defendant argued that the state was responsible for any inconsistency by a witness. This court rejected that proposition ruling that “[i]nconsistencies separate from suborned perjury simply goes to the weight of the evidence.” Id. at 12. Accordingly, appellate counsel was
not ineffective for failing to argue that the state suborned perjury to obtain Powell’s conviction. 

The court has reviewed the testimony of D.E. and the investigator and
concludes there is no record evidence that such additional interviews occurred. Appellate counsel in the exercise of professional judgment properly refused to make an argument without a basis in the record. ",,Napue v. Illinois,EILEEN T. GALLAGHER ,Eileen T. Gallagher,"MICHELLE J. SHEEHAN, J.

(2) Powell’s rights to due process and a fundamentally fair trial were compromised by the jury’s improper exposure to evidence of a third victim whom the state did not call as a witness.

¶ 34} In her sixth assignment of error, Grieco asserts that the prosecutors
submitted a falsified police report to the grand jury to secure her indictment, and did so knowingly, as the audio from Godsey’s body microphone proved that he had washed Grieco’s hands off (or allowed her to wash her hands off). Grieco also contends that the prosecutors improperly submitted other evidence that Godsey had gathered “AFTER the original evidence tampering,” which raised “a huge question of the validity” of the evidence submitted to the grand jury and the court, and that the prosecutors “did not correct these falsities.”",No error,"we conclude that Grieco’s assertion is both belied by the record and barred by res judicata, because she was aware of the transcript from at least the time of the court’s decision on her motion to suppress. Finally,
we note that the Supreme Court of Ohio has held that the “suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution. See, e.g., State v. Johnston, 39 Ohio St.3d 48, 529 N.E.2d 898, 901 (1988),
citing Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). In our view, the transcript of the exchange between Godsey and Grieco at the scene was not material to Grieco’s guilt.7",,Brady v. Maryland,Mary Donovan,Mary E. Donovan,"Tucker, Hall","Michael J. Tucker,Michael T. Hall",Mathias Heck Jr. ,"""Mathias H. Heck, Jr.""","{¶ 31} These assignments of error involve Deputy Godsey’s report, the recording of his exchange with Grieco at the scene, the blood on Grieco’s hands, and the towel used to clean her hands. In her first assignment of error, Grieco asserts that she had submitted evidence to show that her constitutional rights had been violated, that Godsey had tampered with evidence in her case and had falsified his police report to cover it up, and that the prosecutors had proof of tampering based on the audio from Godsey’s body microphone and withheld it. Grieco asserts that the State relied upon the “falsified police report” for the purpose of obtaining an indictment against her.

{¶ 41} While Grieco insists that Godsey’s report and the scene log were attached
to her petition, the record demonstrates that neither document was attached thereto; however, as noted above, the documents were attached to Grieco’s motion for expert assistance, which was filed at the same time as Grieco’s petition. But even if we consider the improperly submitted documents, Grieco’s assigned errors fail.

{¶ 45} In Grieco’s direct appeal, we noted that, when deputies arrived on the scene of the shooting, they observed Underwood lying on the floor on his back, and Grieco “kneeling next to [him] with her hands on top of a towel on top of his chest.” Grieco, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 28542, 2020-Ohio-6956, ¶ 2. Godsey testified at the suppression hearing that Grieco and Underwood were the only ones present at the scene when he arrived. Even if the scene log and report had been properly-submitted new evidence, they did not establish substantive grounds for relief that would have entitled Grieco to a hearing. Grieco failed to set forth operative facts showing that any evidence that Godsey destroyed or failed to preserve was materially exculpatory evidence, or that Godsey acted in bad faith. Grieco’s petition provided no evidence that Godsey acted with a dishonest purpose, conscious wrongdoing, or ill will. As the trial court noted, the blood on Grieco’s hands and on the towel used to clean them, “which presumably would have been Mr. Underwood’s blood, would not have been materially exculpatory.”",https://www.supremecourt.ohio.gov/rod/docs/pdf/2/2021/2021-Ohio-735.pdf,"""Ohio v.

CO - this was an application for reopening of a previous appeal with the same number but a different citation (2017-Ohio-7882.) After the application for reopening was declined, Makin appealed to the Ohio Supreme Court. The court declined jurisdiction in August 2018.

There are also multiple federal cases linked to Makin. The first petition was filed in July 2018 (1:18-cv-01521-JRK.) PM is alleged. The magistrate in the case recommended the case be dismissed. In the report, the magistrate affirmed no Brady violation occurred. Other allegations of PM made were procedurally barred, found to be no error, or found to be not cognizable. The judge accepted those recommendations and dismissed the petition in December 2021. The judge noted there were not reasonable grounds for further appeal. But Makin appealed (21-4222.) The sixth district denied the appeal in June 2022. Makin filed a motion for reconsideration in August of that year, which the court ultimately denied in October 2022. Semi concurrently, Makin filed another habeas petition alleging PM in a manner nearly identical to the appeal that's the subject of this record.

We presume that the jury followed the instructions from the trial court, unless it is demonstrated otherwise. State v. Tucker, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2017-12-172, 2019-Ohio-911, ¶ 38.

{¶53} First, Miller argues the state did not provide the defense with certain evidence during discovery that the trial court should have required the state to produce. Miller argues that he was denied a fair trial because the state failed to produce a copy of a recorded phone call that occurred between a detective and Sara after Miller was arrested. However, Miller did not establish that the phone call occurred or that it was recorded. We note that Miller had the opportunity to challenge Sara and the detective about the alleged phone call because they appeared at trial as witnesses and Miller was able to cross-examine them regarding any phone calls that occurred.",No error,"46: However, what the prosecutor did or did not tell the alleged victim regarding what charges

The question is the fairness of trial, not the culpability of the prosecutor. Id. Again, this was the rebuttal portion of closing argument, and no issue is taken with the initial closing argument presented by the state. 

Based on our review of the entire case, the contested remarks were not
outcome determinative and did not deny Appellant a fair trial. As Appellant’s substantial rights were not affected, there is no reason to consider exercising our discretion to recognize plain error. This assignment of error is overruled.

testimony regarding the likelihood of finding physical evidence

the error was harmless error. 

------------


6. Although the state improperly elicited testimony from the case
worker on re-direct examination that there were no indicators that
the victim “was untruthful”, the error was not prejudicial since there
was substantial evidence, including DNA evidence, to convict appellant. 

------------
Appellant identifies several instances in his Ninth Assignment of Error
which he asserts arise to prosecutorial misconduct and otherwise deprived him of his due process rights due to: (1) improper burden shifting; (2) inadequate curative instruction,
(3) improper and prejudicial hearsay and demeanor testimony throughout the case-inchief; (4) intentionally misstating testimony; (5) denigration of defense counsel; and (6) inappropriate sympathy ploys or emotional pleas during closing statements.

{¶ 88} Appellant next challenges the prosecutor’s statement in closing argument that “defendants DNA was inside and outside her underwear in several places” in his first closing argument. 

{¶ 89} Next, appellant’s trial counsel objected to a statement by the prosecutor in his final rebuttal closing arguments that suggested defense counsel’s closing argument to the jury was “an appeal to you to consider outside of that very narrow focus of the instructions, testimony, exhibits is an inappropriate appeal to you to … violate your oath.” ",Harmless error,"{¶ 56} Ms. McCall’s opinion about the likelihood or unlikelihood of finding
physical evidence of a sexual assault through photographs or trauma was clearly related to matters beyond the knowledge or experience possessed by lay persons. As such, it was expert testimony [...] {¶ 60} Upon review, we find that the state was obligated to disclose this opinion
pursuant to Crim.R. 16 (K). we next turn to the question of whether the
Crim.R. 16(K) violation prejudiced the appellant or whether it constituted harmless error. 

{¶ 63} Because there is not a reasonable possibility that the outcome of this trial would otherwise have been different, the admission of McCall’s opinion on this issue was harmless error.

------------------


{¶ 65} Sandusky County Children Services caseworker Angela Wheeler admitted on cross examination that in the past she has been involved in cases where children misperceive inappropriate conduct as sexual abuse or expose themselves to pornography then turn it into an allegation. On redirect, Wheeler testified there were no indicators that L.Y. was being “untruthful.” [...]Thus, there was substantial evidence outside of Wheeler’s improper testimony, for the jury to find appellant guilty of the rape and importuning. Appellant’s Sixth Assignment of Error is
found not well-taken. 


------------

On review, we note that the testimony presented was that appellant’s
DNA was found in the interior and exterior panels of L.Y.’s underwear. Accordingly, we cannot conclude that the prosecutor’s statements in closing argument amount to prosecutorial misconduct. 

{¶ 92} We agree that the prosecutor engaged in improper behavior with his remarks directed at defense counsel and his motives for making closing argument.
{¶ 93} However, our focus is on the issue of whether the trial was fair, not the culpability of the prosecutor. {¶ 94} Upon review of the record, we disagree with appellant about the prejudicial nature of the prosecutor’s conduct in this instance. The misconduct cited did not pervade
the trial to such a degree that there was a denial of due process.

state’s failure to disclose McCall’s expert testimony pursuant to Crim.R. 16(K) in her
report that the lack of physical findings during the S.A.N.E. examination did not foreclose that the abuse occurred, and Wheeler’s limited testimony regarding the lack of  non-truthfulness indicators in Wheeler’s interview of L.Y. We determined that McCall’s
testimony, although it was required to be disclosed pursuant to Crim.R. 16(K) was common expert testimony offered in sexual assault case and although not disclosed, was not a surprise to defense counsel. Similarly relating to the lack of “non-truthfulness indicators,” we concluded Wheeler’s testimony was harmless error due to remaining
substantial evidence supporting appellant’s conviction, namely that appellant’s DNA was found on L.Y.’s underwear.

{¶ 29} In his second assignment, Phifer argues that he was denied a fair trial when the prosecutor made several improper and inflammatory remarks during his closing and rebuttal closing arguments.",Harmless error,"¶ 36} Furthermore, the prosecutor’s statements in closing argument regarding Phifer being “indirectly responsible” for someone overdosing in Clark County were entirely improper. There was no evidence adduced by the State that anyone overdosed on methamphetamine sold by Phifer. Additionally, by citing statistics and mentioning himself, his father, and his brother, the prosecutor sought only to inflame the jury with his rhetoric. The prosecutor’s statements were clearly improper for closing argument.

{¶ 38} Nevertheless, Phifer failed to object to any of the prosecutor’s statements at trial. Therefore, as previously stated, the prosecutor's remarks cannot be grounds for error unless they served to deny Phifer a fair trial. On that basis, we find that the prosecutor's comments do not rise to the level of plain error. Ample evidence of Phifer’s guilt was adduced by the State, and the statements in this case were not so inflammatory that the jury’s findings were the product of passion and prejudice rather than proof of guilt. State v. Jackson, 107 Ohio St.3d 53, 836 N.E.2d 1173, 2005-Ohio-5981, ¶ 113. In addition, a prosecutor's argument must be viewed in its entirety to determine prejudice. State v. Hill, 75 Ohio St.3d 195, 204, 661 N.E.2d 1068 (1996). Finally, the trial court instructed the jurors that they must not be influenced by any consideration of sympathy or prejudice.

The trial court erred to appellant’s prejudice by failing to declare a

that corroborated the testimony of Mr. Castro, clearly engaged in improper vouching that
bolstered Castro’s and the victim’s testimony by implying knowledge of facts outside the
record. See Graham, 164 Ohio St.3d 187, 2020-Ohio-6700, 172 N.E.3dd 841, at ¶ 96;
Davis at ¶ 232. And despite the trial court’s curative instruction, the jury demonstrated
sustained curiosity about the existence of additional eyewitness statements that would
corroborate Mr. Castro’s statement. Given that the final jury instructions on the matter

were as nonspecific as the initial, clearly ineffective, curative instruction, we find that the
jury’s failure to disregard the prosecutor’s improper statement resulted in substantial
prejudice to appellant, such that a fair trial was no longer possible. See Westwood at ¶ 42.

NP Gorsuch explained that the hierarchy for diagnosis was “highly concerning, concerning, moderate concern, low concern.” (Tr. at 288). She opined that A.B.’s case was “concerning” for sexual abuse because she had a good disclosure, good details, and supportive information from her sister and brother. (Tr. at 289).

instances of prosecutorial misconduct and argues the cumulative effect of prosecutorial misconduct deprived him of a fair trial. The alleged prosecutorial misconduct relates to (1) the prosecutor’s allusion to another shooting incident involving appellant in the opening statement and the introduction of ballistic evidence showing the shell casing found in the instant shooting matched those found in the other incident, and (2) the prosecutor’s elicitation of alleged improper victim-impact testimony. We address these two claims

Under the fourth assignment of error, appellant argues the trial court
erred in admitting the Wadena Street surveillance video. He claims the state withheld the evidence from the defense until days before trial in violation of Crim.R. 16 and, therefore, the trial court should have excluded the evidence.

The record reflects the police had possession of the surveillance video
soon after the murder incident. However, the state did not disclose the existence of the video to the defense until November 1, 2019, three days before the scheduled trial date on November 4. The defense immediately filed a motion in limine. ",Harmless error,"Considering the prosecutor’s conduct in the context of the entire trial and balancing the nature of the prosecutor’s remark, the lack of objection or request for a curative instruction, and the strength of the evidence against appellant, we do not find the prosecutor’s conduct prejudicially affected appellant’s substantial rights or denied him a fair trial. 

Appellant argues on appeal that Smith’s testimony about the victim’s
family situation and his recently joining the church is improper victim-impact testimony and the prosecutor engaged in misconduct in eliciting the testimony. We disagree. Smith’s testimony does not appear to relate to the victim’s personal characteristics or the emotional impact his murder had on his family.  The prosecution did not engage in misconduct eliciting improper victim impact statement.

Appellant argues the cumulative effect of prosecutorial misconduct
deprived him of a fair trial. Given the foregoing discussion, we cannot conclude the effect of the claimed misconduct by the prosecutor, cumulative or otherwise, deprived appellant his constitutional right to a fair trial. The first assignment of error is without merit.

While the prosecutor’s alleged failure to resolve the technical difficulties regarding the video until days before the trial is concerning, our review of the record does not indicate the state acted willfully. Even if we were to agree that the knowledge of the existence of the video and its content, which corroborated the state’s witness and could undermine appellant’s defense (another person committed the murder), might have potentially aided the defense in preparing for trial, appellant has not demonstrated that his defense was prejudiced by not having the ability to meaningfully review or contest the video disclosed three days before the trial.

{P88} Here, the trial court heard the state’s explanations regarding the
delay of the disclosure but did not make a finding on whether the state’s conduct was willful. Willfulness is “‘intentional deviation from a clear duty or from a definite rule of conduct, a deliberate purpose not to discharge some duty necessary to safety, or purposely doing some wrongful acts with knowledge or appreciation of the  likelihood of resulting injury.’” State v. Bowshier, 2d Dist. Clark No. 06-CA-41, 2007-Ohio-5364, ¶ 31, quoting Whitfield v. Dayton, 167 Ohio App.3d 172, 181, 2006-Ohio- 2917, 854 N.E.2d 532, ¶ 30 (2d Dist.). While the prosecutor’s alleged failure to resolve the technical difficulties regarding the video until days before the
trial is concerning, our review of the record does not indicate the state acted willfully.

{P89} Regarding the second and third factors, even if we were to agree that the knowledge of the existence of the video and its content, which corroborated the state’s witness and could undermine appellant’s defense (another person committed the murder), might have potentially aided the defense in preparing for trial, appellant has not demonstrated that his defense was prejudiced by not having the ability to meaningfully review or contest the video disclosed three days before the trial. The trial transcript reflects the defense counsel examined Special Agent Robert Surgenor at great length regarding the surveillance video. Thus, our review shows the evidence was disclosed “in time for its effective use at trial” and the timing of the disclosure did not impair “the fairness of the trial.” State v. White, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 10AP-34, 2011-Ohio-2364, ¶ 41. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the surveillance video after ensuring the defense had an opportunity to view it before trial.

St.3d 460, 480, 739 N.E.2d 749 (2001). Therefore, we cannot say that appellant was
prejudiced by the prosecutor’s opening remarks. 

(¶47) The prosecutor had a good faith basis for asking Ronda if she
knew that cell phone records placed her son in the vicinity of the crime scene since
the state’s cell phone expert had evidence to support that fact. We, therefore, find
nothing inappropriate in this line of questioning. 

(¶51) The prosecutor in this case should not have suggested that appellant
was guilty of murder while questioning his father. However, because the question
was an isolated incident, and because the evidence of appellant’s guilt was
overwhelming, we cannot say that the single, inappropriate question deprived
appellant of a fair trial. Indeed, the jury acquitted him of murder and found him
guilty of the lesser-included offense of reckless homicide. 

(¶52) Finally, appellant argues that the state asked inappropriate and
prejudicial questions of Det. Menary. Specifically, appellant objects to the
following:
Q: Did you expect to find a gun at that home that would match?

In the context of this case, we do not find that the prosecutor's comments were legally incorrect, that his actions were improper or that Singleton's substantial rights were prejudicially affected by the comment. 

That comment did not so infect the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process as the state’s obligation to prove all the elements of the crime were clearly stated. The trial court's instructions provided a definition of the element of purpose and its response to the jury's question regarding consent served to emphasize the obligation of the state to prove intent and purpose.

appellant as a ""murderer."" (Appellant's Brief at 23.) Appellant references one statement in appellee's closing argument (""[appellant] murdered [Lundy]"") and three statements during questioning of witnesses: ""Now, would you compare what you had for lunch 3 years ago the same as watching James Lundy be murdered * * *?""; ""Did you ever detract * * * from what you basically had told [the detective regarding] in terms of who murdered James Lundy?""; and ""Up until the day he was murdered by [appellant]"". (Tr. Vol. III at 673, 676, 782.) 

{¶ 95} Appellant next argues the prosecutor misled the jury by misstating the law in appellee's closing argument by telling the jury multiple times that appellant had a duty to retreat when he did not have such a duty and, relatedly, by misstating the facts by telling
the jury appellant shot Lundy while standing directly over him in the yard. (Tr. Vol. IV at 1002, 1004, 1035-36.) "" 'The prosecuting attorney does not instruct the jury on the law, the
trial judge does.' "" Shine-Johnson at ¶ 74, quoting State v. Palmer, 7th Dist. No. 89-B-28 (Aug. 29, 1996). ""However, a prosecuting attorney should not mislead the jury by either misstating the law or the facts."" Id.",Harmless error,"However, we agree with appellant that to the extent the prosecutor during
closing argument stated or implied appellant violated a duty to retreat by exiting the four walls of his house and entering his front porch, this was an incorrect statement of law. See R.C. 2901.09(A) (Sept. 2008 version); R.C. 2901.05(D)(2) and (3) (Mar. 2019 version) (collectively establishing that a person has no duty to retreat if ""in that person's residence,"" including an attached porch). Nevertheless, the prosecutor's improper conduct did not prejudicially affect appellant's substantial rights in this case. 

{¶ 99} In the context of the entire trial, it does not appear clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury would have found the defendant guilty even absent the misconduct. LaMar at ¶ 121. Appellee had the burden to disprove just one of the elements of selfdefense. Carney at ¶ 31. Appellee presented overwhelming evidence that appellant was at
fault in creating the situation giving rise to the affray and did not have a bona fide belief that he was in imminent danger of death or great bodily harm for which the use of deadly force was his only means of escape, thereby disproving the two other elements of selfdefense.

In the fourth assignment of error, Schentur contends that the state

Schentur’s past convictions and displayed the LEADS report to the jury so that the
jury saw inadmissible, inaccurate, and prejudicial material. ",No error,"The state did not elicit testimony from Eckert about Schentur’s
criminal history. Eckert’s misstatements about Schentur’s “criminal convictions”
were just that ─ misstatements the witness made that were objected to and stricken from the record. The state, at the request of defense counsel and at the direction of the trial court, had Eckert clarify that Schentur did not have a criminal record. 
On cross-examination, defense counsel had the witness reiterate that the defendant did not have a criminal record. Schentur also contends that the jury improperly saw that she had
previously received a traffic ticket when the state published the LEADS report to the jury. It is unknown what the jury saw, if anything, when the state briefly showed it the report and a redacted version of the report was admitted.

child abuse to him when there was no evidence that he ever struck or beat A.D.
However, as previously stated, evidence of Sierra’s prior acts of abuse pertained
solely to her and made no reference to Lewis. Indeed, the evidence clearly showed
that Lewis was not involved in A.D.’s life until July 2017, and the prior acts evidence
concerned incidents that occurred before that time. Nevertheless, Lewis objects to
the following excerpt from the state’s closing argument:
The only person that wasn’t happy in that equation was [A.D.]. Because
there came a point in time, ladies and gentlemen, that regardless of who
struck her or where the blow came from, this child suffered a blow. And
I submit to you they are equally culpable for that blow. One is not more
responsible than the other. Once she suffered that blow, that child
started to deteriorate right in front of their eyes. As human beings, we
nurture people that are ill. We spend hours at hospice centers watching
people die because we love them. We don’t let them be alone.
But these two, they don’t have a heart or a soul for what they did to this
child. Torture and cruelly abuse. And she has the audacity to say find
them not guilty? Are you kidding me?
Not so much as a glass of water? She couldn’t talk. She couldn’t tell
you what she was going through. The only thing she knew was lying in
a bed, soaked with urine. That’s what she knew. And those were the
end of her days. Lying in a bed soaked with urine. 


Lewis also argues the prosecutor committed misconduct by asserting
there was no evidence that he lived anywhere but with Sierra. Lewis argues these remarks misrepresented the evidence because Lewis included his parents’ address on his written statement to police. ",No error,"Even if Lewis did not directly cause A.D.’s injuries, the evidence
showed that he permitted the abuse and concealed the harm to A.D., thereby
preventing her from receiving any medical treatment that might have saved her life or alleviated her suffering. Therefore, there was nothing inappropriate about the
prosecutor’s observation that Lewis contributed to A.D’s suffering and death
-------
Although it is true that Lewis wrote his parents’ address on the police report, there was no testimony from any witness that he lived anywhere but with Sierra. Therefore, the prosecutor’s statement is not wholly inaccurate since there was no oral testimony supporting his claim that he lived with his parents.

Before reaching
that issue, however, this Court must address whether the trial court had authority to consider Mr. Lawless’s petition for post-conviction relief.

R.C. 2953.23(A)(1)(a). The trial court, therefore, did not have authority to consider the petition.
 We need not consider whether Mr. Lawless established “by clear and convincing evidence that, but for constitutional error, no reasonable factfinder would have found [him] guilty[.]” R.C. 2953.23(A)(1)(b); Morris, 2018-Ohio-4527, at ¶ 25.

The last was from the prosecutor who was assigned to Mr. Lawless’s case and was dated September 5, 2017. Mr. Lawless argued in his petition that the affidavits demonstrated why it should be considered timely under Section 2953.23(A)(1)(a)  Very interesting that the prosecutor here filed an affadavit in support of the timeliness of the appeal. 

It also says it continaed an affadavit from the witness :The affidavit of the co-defendant’s mother, from January 2017, contains extensive allegations about how the State allegedly pressured her to convince her son to testify against Mr. Lawless. It also contains her recollection of conversations that she had with her son in which he told her about the pressure, threats, and promises he had received from the State to convince him to testify. Mr. Lawless, therefore, would have been aware of possible coercion of his co-defendant by January 2017 at the latest.

has not identified any evidence that was withheld by the State, either related to his residency or otherwise. Moreover, as stated above, whether Housley was or was not a visitor, rather than a resident, was within Housley’s knowledge at the time of his arrest and throughout his case.

denying her motion to dismiss. Appellant argues dismissal was a proper sanction under
Crim.R.16 for the state’s alleged failure to disclose material evidence favorable to her
defense in violation of her constitutional rights identified in Brady v. Maryland. We
disagree. ",No error,"Charging her with cruelty to animals was, himself, previously accused of cruelty
to animals. Appellant argues these allegations are material to her defense as they impact the warden’s credibility as a witness. She further argues the state’s failure to disclose this information deprived her of a fair trial.
{¶ 11} The record with regard to these allegations consists of appellant’s pretrial oral motion to dismiss and the state’s response. In support of her motion, appellant argued she received information regarding the allegations against the warden through a public records request to the Ohio Department of Agriculture which were not disclosed by the state prior to her trial. The state acknowledged having been recently made aware of an investigation into the party making the prior allegations against the warden but noted the actual claims of animal abuse were referred to the Ohio Attorney General to avoid a conflict in investigating a fellow county official. The state further noted that the Ohio Attorney General’s investigation resulted in no charges being filed against the warden and that the allegations were more than three years old at the time of appellant’s trial. 

Appellant countered that even an allegation of animal cruelty was sufficient to warrant disclosure as the information went to the warden’s credibility as one of the state’s two witnesses. The trial court denied appellant’s motion to dismiss based on the representations of the parties and the matter proceeded to trial.
{¶ 12} Our review of the record reveals nothing to support appellant’s argument that the allegations against the warden were material and therefore subject to disclosure. by the state. Allegations of animal cruelty against the warden from three years prior to appellant’s trial do not attach to his credibility as a witness. “Under Evid.R. 608(B), the ability of trial counsel to discredit a witness through cross-examination concerning
particular conduct of a witness is not absolute; it is limited in its exercise to the court’s sound discretion in determining if the inquiry will lead to particular instances of conduct
which are clearly probative of untruthfulness.” State v. Whites Landing Fisheries, LLC,
2017-Ohio-7537, 96 N.E.3d 1236, ¶ 48 (6th Dist.), citing State v. Williams, 1 Ohio App.3d 156, 158, 440 N.E.2d 65 (10th Dist.1981). In White Landing Fisheries, we affirmed the trial court’s order barring attempted impeachment of the state’s witness
using allegations of past criminal behavior since those allegations, for which no criminal charges were filed, were not clearly probative of the witnesses’ untruthfulness. Id. at
¶ 52-53. We reach the same conclusion here and find no connection between the warden having been merely accused of animal cruelty and his ability to testify truthfully.
Additionally, at trial the warden testified that the basis for the charges against appellant was the information he received from the veterinarian. Therefore, any issue regarding his credibility is unlikely to have resulted in a different outcome as the factual basis for the verdict was established by the veterinarian.
{¶ 13} Accordingly, we find the allegations against the warden were not subject to disclosure by the state as they do not constitute favorable material evidence as described in Brady. ",,,ZMUDA,Gene A. Zmuda,"Mark L. Pietrykowski, J.

This court also found that there was no violation of Crim.R. 16 because the state’s failure to disclose was not a willful violation, the appellant had not demonstrated how the knowledge of the DNA would have benefitted him in his defense, defense counsel did not request a continuance for further investigation once he became aware of the evidence, and the appellant did not demonstrate that he was prejudiced by the state’s failure to disclose the DNA evidence. Id. at ¶ 22.

(57) In this case, the state’s failure to disclose the existence of a DNA swab did not violate Newell’s right to a fair trial. Newell’s DNA standard was initially sent to BCI but was returned to the East Cleveland Police Department. BCI requested the standard again, but the police did not send the swab to BCI a second time for testing or comparison. While the mix-up is concerning, Newell has not shown that the failure to disclose the existence of the DNA swab was a willful violation of Crim.R. 16. Moreover, Newell has not shown that this untested DNA was material to a finding of guilt and or a reasonable probability that the result of the proceeding would have been different had the existence of the DNA standard been disclosed.

(60) We, therefore, find no merit to his claims. The trial court did not err in denying Newell’s motion for a mistrial or in deciding not to sanction the state for any alleged misconduct. The first, second, and third assignments of error are overruled. ",,,LARRY A. JONES,Larry A. Jones Sr.,"PATRICIA ANN BLACKMON, ANITA LASTER MAYS","Patricia Ann Blackmon,Anita Laster Mays",Michael C.

{¶162} The defense first moved for a mistrial on the basis that the fire marshal’s report from the fire that occurred at Scott’s house in 2008 contained exculpatory evidence, and the state
failed to disclose this evidence to the defense. Appellant argues that the state’s failure to disclose the report and exculpatory information therein “compromised the defense’s ability to effectively prepare for trial.” Appellant’s brief at 39.

{¶170} Appellant argues that the prosecutor’s reference to his prior arson conviction “severely and unfairly prejudiced the integrity of the case” and “compromised the [jury’s] verdict[.]” Appellant’s brief at 39.",No error,"Brady violation holding: 
{¶168} We cannot say that the fire marshal report pertaining to the 2008 fire materially affected appellant’s rights. One of the defense’s theories of the case was that the fire at Bewley’s house was caused by a cigarette. To the extent that appellant argues that the fire marshal report was exculpatory because the 2008 fire was similar to the Bewley fire in that they were both caused by smoking, Reitmeier testified that there was no indication that anyone had been smoking inside Bewley’s house. (Tr. 1607.) While the fire at Scott’s house was accidental in nature, investigators opined that the Bewley fire was intentionally set.

**
Examination of witness holding:
{¶171} Contrary to appellant’s assertion, the prosecutor did not reference appellant’s prior arson conviction during cross-examination. Rather, the prosecutor asked Dr. Pritchard whether he was aware that appellant had “an arson in his past[.]” (Tr. 2144-2146.) As noted above in the analysis of appellant’s first assignment of error, the jury already heard Jason Spang’s testimony about the fire that broke out in the family home after appellant volunteered to “fix” the furnace. Finally, the trial court provided a limiting instruction to the jury, and a jury is presumed to follow the instructions provided by the trial court. See Garner, 74 Ohio St.3d at 59, 656 N.E.2d 623.
{¶172} Based on the foregoing analysis, we find that the trial court did not abuse its
discretion in denying defense counsel’s motion for a mistrial pertaining to the reference to arson
in appellant’s past. Appellant’s seventh assignment of error is overruled in this respect.

{¶26} Appellant contends either the motion for continuance or mistrial should have been granted because the failure to disclose the information regarding the conversation between Arnold and Myers was a Brady violation.",Did not reach error/conduct did not result in prejudice,"{¶29} In this instance there were discovery requests from Appellant to disclose all material evidence favorable to Appellant. The State admitted at trial the information regarding the Arnold-Myers conversation was not disclosed; the state did not believe it was part of its investigation and believed it was irrelevant. 

{¶30} Appellant asserts the information provided to Arnold by Myers was the catalyst to investigate Appellant. He asserts the conversation could have been used to support his entrapment defense. He claims he was committed to the defense of entrapment and the jury could have easily seen this case as a mother protecting her daughter by falsely accusing Appellant and causing an investigation into him to occur.

{¶33} Consequently, the record does not suggest the Myers-Arnold conversation was material; there is not a probability sufficient to undermine the confidence in the outcome.

Taylor,Steven Lee Taylor,Conway,James,James Conway,White,2002,Murder,Murder,,,,Male,Death,checked,2016,Brady violation,"{¶ 36} Conway identifies four categories of undisclosed information that he believes would have been favorable to his defense, each of which we consider in turn. 
ial that he fired the shots. Conway II at ¶ 19.
{¶ 40} Conway also asserts that a Brady violation occurred because the state withheld a letter from Ronald Trent to prosecutors in which Trent stated that he wanted to
testify in exchange for a deal. (Petition at 31.) Attached to the petition is a letter from Trent to the Franklin County Prosecutor dated March 12, 2002, in which Trent states that he has
""detailed information on this case"" and is ""willing to work out a deal with your office.""
(Petition Ex. No. 26.) According to Conway, this statement was inconsistent with Trent's
testimony at trial, where he stated that his motivation for testifying against Conway was ""because he laughed at someone else's pain from another killing."" (Petition at 31; Tr. Vol. X
at 1825.) ",No error,"{¶ 39} Even if these interviews were not available to Conway because the state withheld them, they do not amount to a violation under Brady because they are not inconsistent the statements that McWhorter made at trial.

{¶ 41} The purported inconsistency cited by Conway would not have had an impeaching effect on Trent at trial. During his testimony, Trent admitted that he went to his initial meeting with the prosecutor hoping to make some kind of deal in exchange for providing information. (Tr. Vol. X at 1830.) In addition, Trent stated that he did make a deal allowing him to obtain work release while in prison in exchange for working with the Franklin County Sheriff's office to gather information. (Tr. Vol. X at 1831). Thus, the letter's contents were not inconsistent with Trent's testimony, would not have had an impeaching effect, and do not support Conway's claim of a Brady violation.

{¶ 42} Second, Conway argues that the state suppressed statements made by eyewitnesses that identified individuals other than Conway as the shooter. (Appellant's Brief at 22.) The statements in question were part of reports prepared by police investigators describing initial leads obtained from interviewing persons who had been at the scene of the shooting, including the surviving victim. (Petition Ex. Nos. 5, 27-38, 41- 43.) Many of the witness statements do not identify the shooter by name, and many fit Conway's physical description at the time of the shooting. Conway fails to connect any of these statements to the testimony of particular witnesses whose credibility they would have impeached. Furthermore, none of these statements were exculpatory because Conway, while testifying on his own behalf, admitted to the shooting at trial. Accordingly, we reject the contention that they support his allegation of a violation under Brady.

{¶ 43} Third, Conway argues that a Brady violation resulted from the prosecution's suppression of evidence that he believes contradicted its theory of the case. (Appellant's Brief at 23.) He again mentions the witness statements, which, for the reasons just discussed, do not demonstrate a Brady violation. Id.
{¶ 44} Conway also cites to what he describes as ""the statement of the security guard"" in exhibit Nos. 54-56. A security guard working at an apartment complex next to the bar where the shooting occurred heard gunfire, saw people running, and saw one man get into a silver Chevrolet that he then drove onto the apartment complex premises. He witnessed the car strike another car before the driver got out and ran into one of the buildings. The security guard reported the license number of the car to the police. (Petition Ex. Nos. 55-56.) The police interviewed the person to whom the car was registered, who claimed not to be at the bar that night. (Petition Ex. No. 54.) It is not clear how this report contradicts the state's theory of the case, and Conway does not elaborate on the assertion that it does. Many people were involved in the fight that immediately preceded the shooting, and it is logical that many of them would flee at the sound of shots being fired.

{¶ 45} Conway also cites to a police interview with an employee of the club named Christopher Laney. (Appellant's Brief at 24; Petition Ex. No. 60.) Laney recounts attempting to separate individuals after a physical assault that occurred inside the club,escorting the victim out, and then witnessing the melee in the parking lot. At that time, an individual who did not match Conway's description pulled what Laney believed to be a gun out of his pocket and pointed it at him. Laney then heard five or six gunshots. (Petition Ex. No. 60.) Once again, Conway does not explain how this information contradicts the state's case. Laney did not state that the man he saw fired the shots he heard. In fact, Laney's narrative suggests that the man he saw did not fire the shots because the encounter with the man holding the gun was nearly contemporaneous with the sound of gunshots and Laney did not report that the man fired the weapon. The interview is merely evidence that another individual besides Conway had a firearm that night. Finally, it must be noted once again that neither Laney's statement nor the security guard's statements exculpate Conway, who admitted to firing the shots that struck the victims.
{¶ 46} In addition, Conway also cites to exhibit No. 61 of his petition with the conclusory assertion that it contains ""statements of other witnesses whose statements impeached the prosecution's case."" (Appellant's Brief at 24.) The exhibit contains an interview with one witness, Michael Nolasco, conducted on January 19, 2002, who witnessed the shooting and saw the shooter flee in an SUV. It is not clear how Nolasco's statement contradicts the state's case. Troy Ankrum, a bouncer, testified at trial that the shooter and others fled in an SUV. (Tr. Vol. VIII at 1250.) Furthermore, during his testimony, Conway admitted fleeing the scene in a vehicle. (Tr. Vol. XIII at 1250.) Thus, Nolasco's statement appears consistent with the state's case.
{¶ 47} Fourth, Conway cites to the evidence discussed in the previous assignment of error pertaining to his first attorney, Christopher Cicero, and asserts that this evidence was suppressed by the state. Conway does not explain how any of the evidence concerning Cicero was impeachable or exculpatory. For the reasons previously discussed, Cicero's statements were far from exculpatory, and because the state never actually called Cicero as a witness, they could not have been used to impeach him.

¶ 48} For the foregoing reasons, the trial court did not err when it dismissed the
fourth ground for relief in Conway's petition. Accordingly, the fourth assignment of error is overruled. ",,,Horton,Timothy S. Horton,"KLATT, P.J. and TYACK, J","William A. Klatt,G.

failed to give [Quinn] a new trial and also failed to provide an evidentiary
hearing. This violated [Quinn’s] right to due process and the failure to
report that the car was destroyed is a Brady violation. 

{¶ 60} Quinn’s tenth assignment of error asserts that the State’s failure to disclose a report from the Clark County Sheriff’s Department about Beverley’s assault and abduction impeded Quinn’s ability to impeach Beverley’s trial testimony. Based on a hospital record’s notation that a “Sheriff deputy” was “taking [a] report from” Beverley in the emergency room on December 14, 2013 (see Trial Court Docket #77, Exh. 10), Quinn
argues that the State withheld a report that could have been used to show that Beverley told the deputy “that she was not sure who assaulted her.” The record does not support that argument. 
",No error,"{¶ 34} Because Quinn is unable to establish a Brady violation relative to the purportedly undisclosed documents, his assignments of error based on the State’s alleged failure to disclose those documents is overruled. 

{¶ 61} As an initial matter, Quinn again has failed to present cognizable evidence to show that the State withheld any requested document of which it was aware. Indeed, in this particular instance, Quinn has not even established that the alleged “report” in fact exists.

We discuss these assigned errors together because they are closely related. ",Harmful error,"{¶30} Buehner had no knowledge of the exculpatory information contained in the undisclosed police reports. Nor did he have any reason to believe that the police reports contained improperly suppressed exculpatory evidence because the state represented that no exculpatory evidence existed. Therefore, although Buehner’s motion for new trial was untimely, his motion for leave to file a motion for new trial and the supporting documents clearly and convincingly demonstrate that Buehner was avoidably prevented from discovering the exculpatory evidence. Therefore, the trial court erred in denying Buehner’s motion for leave to file a motion for new trial. ",Evidentiary Hearing,Brady v. Maryland,EILEEN T. GALLAGHER,Eileen T.

the State’s failure to provide discovery and trial counsel’s failure to file
motion to suppress, dismiss, or for mistrial, based on a Brady violation. 

{¶62} Appellant asserts that when the video of the altercation in the
jail was first provided to his counsel, counsel was unable to operate it and
consequently, made numerous requests for a video he could operate.
Eventually Appellant was taken to the prosecutor’s office and viewed a
video depicting the incident. Appellant further asserts that at trial: (1) the
State played a longer video


{¶63} Furthermore, Appellant argues the discrepancy in the video
provided and the video utilized at trial was a Brady violation. As such,
Appellant asserts his trial counsel should have filed either a motion to
suppress the video, a motion to dismiss the indictment against him, or a
motion for a mistrial, based on the State’s actions. Having not done so,
Appellant argues his trial counsel’s representation was deficient. Again, we point out that the alleged discrepancy in the video and counsel’s alleged recognition of such are matters outside of the record on appeal. ",No error,"Assuming a prior video did exist, we would not find a Brady

Austin further argues that the state’s failure to provide him with the surveillance video amounted to a Brady violation that caused him to “wrongfully accept a plea agreement,” resulting in a manifest
injustice. ",Did not reach anything/ reverses on other grounds,"As explained above, the state concedes that the trial court erred in denying Austin’s motion, but for a different reason. The state, relying on State v. Moon, 8th Dist.

would have been different had George’s second statement been disclosed to Barrow’s counsel prior to trial. 

While George’s second statement differed from his original statement to police, it was consistent with his trial testimony. At trial, Barrow’s counsel attacked George’s credibility by pointing out that in his statement to police he had failed to mention Barrow had contacted him to purchase marijuana. While defense counsel may have been able to further attack George’s credibility by pointing out the difference between his first and second statements, any alleged failure by the state to provide Barrow’s counsel this evidence was not material. 

Barrow’s counsel additionally had the opportunity to question Detective Hilbert about the content of the second interview and to extensively cross-examine Detective Hilbert about his disclosure of George’s
second statement and its impact on George’s trial testimony.

Specifically, McGuire argues first that without the body camera footage, he was unable to put forth a self-defense argument at trial without this evidence of the position of Mac’s body as he lay dying in the car. He further argues that the state’s withholding of evidence relating to Officer Bolton’s misconduct investigation was relevant impeachment evidence. McGuire addresses each alleged violation individually, but ultimately argues that the two are intertwined and therefore should be analyzed for their cumulative effect on his due process rights.",No error,"{¶25} Further, to the extent that McGuire’s argument here rests on not only the existence of the Bolton investigation but specific details acquired by the state in the course of the investigation, this is still insufficient to create a Brady violation. It is
important to note that the state never called Bolton as a witness. This is critical, as the obligation set forth in Giglio relates to impeachment evidence. It is impossible to impeach an individual who does not testify as a witness. While we acknowledge that the state included Officer Bolton on its initial witness list provided to the defense, he was ultimately not called as a witness. For these reasons, this does not amount to a Brady
violation. 
{¶35} Here, McGuire alleges that Bolton somehow corrupted the investigation of his case. In support of this allegation, McGuire relies on Bolton’s unrelated criminal case. A reference to an unrelated incident is insufficient to establish that the state acted
in bad faith in failing to preserve the body camera evidence. Based on the East Cleveland Police Department policy articulated on the record at trial, we know that the failure to preserve the body camera evidence constitutes a breach of a known duty. We cannot, however, conclude that it was done through some ulterior motive or ill will as required for a finding of bad faith. There is nothing in the record indicating bad faith as
alleged by McGuire. In fact, the record reveals a thorough, though ultimately fruitless, effort by the prosecutor to procure body camera evidence. ",,Brady v. Maryland,TIM McCORMACK,Tim McCormack,"LARRY A. JONES, SR., J., and

indictment due to the failure of the State to preserve all of the video footage from the jail surveillance system for the time frame of the offenses alleged in the indictment. 

{¶92} At the motion hearing, which arguably should be referenced as
a pretrial conference in chambers because no testimony was taken and the court made his ruling on the motion based upon the representations of counsel, defense counsel pointed out the jail was under constant 24-hour surveillance. He pointed out the surveillance video obtained in discovery showed only 157 minutes of footage related to the alleged felonious assault on June 18, 2016, and nothing before or after. Defense counsel argued as he prepared for trial, he realized there must be video footage of the alleged kidnapping which occurred afterwards. At that point, he issued a subpoena for the alleged materially exculpatory evidence.

By the time Appellant made a specific request, on October
14, 2016, the surveillance footage was no longer available, in accordance
with the routine procedures of the jail and the surveillance system. ",No error,"{¶96} The trial court ultimately ruled that there was no suggestion that
the alleged discarded video evidence was materially exculpatory, or that
potentially useful evidence was destroyed in bad faith. We agree with the
trial court’s ruling. In our view, defense counsel’s argument then and on
appeal is based on pure speculation. Therefore, Appellant has failed to carry his burden to show that the requested surveillance footage was materially exculpatory.


¶99} Based upon the foregoing, we find the requested surveillance
footage was not materially exculpatory. Appellant cannot show the missing footage provides evidence which exonerates him or in any way challenges the substance of the allegations. Furthermore, in the event the surveillance footage could be somehow considered potentially useful, there has been no showing of bad faith.

{¶31} In his third assignment of error, appellant challenges the decision of
the police to not download all of the data on Jarrod’s cell phone as part of their investigation. In so doing, appellant claims that the police failed to preserve material exculpatory evidence in violation of Brown’s due process rights. Alternatively, appellant asserts that the police, in failing to download all of the contents of Jarrod’s phone, failed to preserve potentially useful evidence. 


{¶35} On March 28, 2017, the State submitted an additional discovery
disclosure. Doc. 51. This document had a phone examination report that showed that the State had downloaded all of the text messages, contacts, notes, multimedia messages, images, and phone logs that were on Jarrod’s phone. ",No error,"{¶36} On appeal, appellant argues that the phone was material to guilt and that all of the cell phone’s content should have been preserved. However, appellant does not demonstrate how the web browsing history and e-mail communications had an apparent exculpatory value at the time of this download. The fact that some of the contents of the phone—the text messages, phone logs, and contact lists— were material to guilt or punishment does not establish that all of the contents of the
phone were material to guilt or punishment. Moreover, appellant has failed to establish that the contents that were not downloaded were exculpatory.

On appeal, appellant fails to identify facts in the record that show the State acted in bad faith during this process. Rather, appellant merely asserts that the State acted in bad faith.

materials that would have assisted him at trial, and that the result would have been different if disclosure had been made. These materials include the Grandview Hospital records regarding an assault of A.J., and allegedly, A.J.’s mental health records.

{¶ 127} Hawkins’ final argument under this assignment of error is that the State committed misconduct when it said the DNA swab was taken at Hawkins’ home when the State knew it had been taken when Hawkins was in jail. ",No error,"{¶ 125} In the case before us, Brady would not apply to the Grandview Hospital records, including records pertaining to A.J.’s mental health, as Hawkins was aware of these records at the time of trial.

¶ 126} Furthermore, the State did not withhold these records. Instead, Grandview Hospital no longer had any records, as the records had been destroyed, pursuant to the hospital’s policy of destroying records after ten years. Id. at p. 9. Accordingly, Brady simply does not apply, and even if it did, there is no indication that the State withheld any evidence.

{¶ 129} Our review of the record indicates that the State did not commit
misconduct. At trial, Hawkins testified during direct examination that a DNA swab had been taken from him in December 2003 when he (Hawkins) was in jail.

Adams,Hayes,Daryle,Daryle Hayes,Black,2019,Other,Arson,,,,,three years of community control,,2019,Summation,"{¶41} In his second assignment of error, Hayes argues that prosecutorial
misconduct during closing argument deprived him of a fair trial. He asserts that the prosecutor improperly vouched for witnesses and misrepresented evidence.

{¶44} Hayes points to prosecutor’s remarks describing Kelley as “earnest,” “passionate,” and “theatrical,” and telling the jury to focus on the facts rather than her credibility. The prosecutor did not vouch for credibility and instructed the jury to focus on the evidence. 

{¶45} Hayes next directs us to the prosecutor’s comment that if Kelley was going to lie, then she “could have told a better lie.” The prosecutor argued that if Kelley was going to falsely implicate Hayes, she could have added further embellishment to her version of the events by saying that she saw Hayes at her car and spoke to him, rather than simply saying she saw a bowlegged man. The comment was in response to the defense attacks on Kelley’s credibility and did not express the prosecutor’s personal view of her credibility.
{¶46} Finally, Hayes argues that the prosecutor dismissed Kelley’s
“contradictory testimony regarding seeing Mr. Hayes walk out of the complex versus seeing him jumping into a white SUV as a ‘mistake’ rather than a lie.” The prosecutor asked the jury to consider whether it was Kelley’s intent to omit information in her 911 call or whether she made a mistake in omitting it, stating, “That’s for you to decide.” This comment did not express the prosecutor’s personal opinion of her credibility. No plain error occurred. ",Harmless error,"To the extent that an imprecise statement about the evidence was
made, the trial court addressed the issue by instructing the jury that the arguments of counsel were not evidence and that the jurors were the sole judges of the facts. Therefore, the prosecution’s statement, and the court’s error in failing to sustain defense counsel’s objection to the misstatement, was harmless. 

{¶53} After reviewing the prosecutor’s closing argument in its entirety, we
hold that, although the prosecutor made a misstatement, the statement in no way permeated the state’s argument so as to deny Hayes a fair trial.",,,Myers,Beth A. Myers,Crouse and JJ Winkler,"Candace C. Crouse,Robert C. Winkler",Joseph T. Deters,Joseph T.

Hayes was convicted of Arson after his ex-girlfriend, Melissa Kelley, said Hayes set her car on fire. Hayes appealed in his conviction on multiple grounds (including that his conviction was against the weight of the evidence.) As for prosecutorial misconduct, Hayes made three claims of prosecutorial misconduct in relation to comments prosecutors made during closing arguments, which he argued were improper vouches for witnesses. The court disagreed on all three counts. The court also addressed three allegations of prosecutorial misconduct related to the misrepresentation of evidence. In one instance, the court said that it was Hayes who misrepresented the record in brief. The second alleged point of misconduct, where Hayes alleged the prosecutor incorrectly said a witness wrote a statement. The witness did write a statement in connection with a police photo array, which was entered into evidence and the court ruled it was properly commented on. 

In the single assignment of error, Hayes argued the prosecutor misstated evidence when he said Hayes told the investigators about his then-current girlfriend's car (which was thought to have been seen at the scene.) Defense counsel objected and the court overruled it. The appellate court used the harmless-error standard as a result and found that although the statement was imprecise (rather than telling investigators directly, investigators figured it out based on what Hayes said,) the error was harmless.

The court held harmful error: ""the prosecutor initially presented facially race-neutral reasons, concerning two murders committed by family members, along with the discriminatory purpose to explain the strike. The state’s racial motivation, however, is not excused or made any less discriminatory because one aspect of the explanation was on its face race neutral.

Hernandez, 500 U.S. at 360, 111 S.Ct. 1859, 114 L.Ed.2d 395. The prosecutor attempted to retract the impermissible race-based reasoning, but to accept that effort under the circumstances would render the Batson decision meaningless. See Batson, 476 U.S. at 98, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69. Thus, we conclude that a discriminatory intent was inherent in the prosecutor’s explanation for the challenge to Juror 5. Id. at 97-98.""

""Thomas complains that State’s Exhibits 24 and 25 contain statements that “Sonny” sold the drugs; however, officers testified regarding the set-up to the controlled buy through the phone call with Thomas, the minivan used for the transaction that was registered to Thomas, the observations of Thomas in the minivan after the CI made the purchases, and the knowledge of officers that Thomas went by the street name of “Sonny.” Thus the statements on the form are cumulative to other evidence in the record.""

Mosley,Black,2017,Sexual violence,Rape,"Kidnapping, Robbery, Obstructing Official Business",,checked,Female,100 years to life,,2017,"Brady violation,Summation,Opening statements","{¶46} At trial, the State drew heavily upon the DNA evidence in crafting a theme for its case. At the center of its theme was the concept of “125 Earths.” The prosecutor argued that “125 is the exact amount of planet Earths that there would have to be of roughly eight billion people for someone, for anyone, to have the exact same sperm fraction DNA as Joseph Mosley.” The State utilized the “125 Earths” theme in both opening statements and closing arguments. Mosley argues that the State’s theme was a “DNA fallacy” that was not based on the evidence.

{¶51} Mosley moved for a new trial based on the State’s failure to produce his medical records from the county jail. His attorneys indicated that, unbeknownst to them at trial, Mosley was being treated for chlamydia at the time of the alleged rapes. Medical records from the jail show that his antibiotics were brought to the jail and administered to him for several days. Mosley attached the jail records to his motion, as well as records from Wooster Community Hospital. The hospital records show that he was diagnosed with chlamydia twelve days before the rapes occurred and prescribed the antibiotic. {¶52} Mosley argues that chlamydia is a highly infectious sexually transmitted disease (“STD”) that likely would have been transmitted to A.F. or T.C. if he had raped them. Because neither victim was treated for chlamydia, he argues, there is a reasonable probability that the result of the proceedings would have been different if the jury had heard evidence about his condition. Mosley argues that he is entitled to a new trial due to the State’s failure to disclose “the STD evidence[.]” ",No error,"{¶49} Upon review, Mosley has not shown that the State engaged in misconduct when fashioning its theme and argument about the DNA evidence. See Jalowiec, 2015-Ohio-5042, at ¶ 48. The State properly highlighted the rarity of Mosley’s DNA profile and the odds of that profile appearing again in the general population (random match probability). 

The prosecutor never argued that there was less than a 1% chance Mosley was innocent. Indeed, the analyst from BCI specifically testified that she did not perform source attribution. The State’s “125 Earths” argument was a reasonable inference drawn from simple math, see M.G., 2017-Ohio-4210, at ¶ 13, quoting Colvin, 2012-Ohio-4914, at ¶ 23, and the record supports the trial court’s determination that it was “consistent with the evidence.” Compare Whack v. State, 433 Md. 728, 746 (2013) (analyst’s testimony that defendant’s DNA might have been present at the scene did not support prosecutor’s argument, “stating emphatically that [the defendant’s] DNA was present”). Mosley has not shown that the prosecutor confused source probability with random match probability or otherwise misrepresented the DNA evidence. See McDaniel at ¶ 28; Whack at 753. Accordingly, we cannot conclude that the trial court abused its discretion when it rejected his claim of prosecutorial misconduct. 

{¶53} Upon review, Mosley has not shown that the trial court abused its discretion when it denied his motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence. See Bressi, 2020-Ohio4, at ¶ 7. Mosley could have discovered the evidence at issue with due diligence, given that he would have been aware of his own medical diagnosis and treatment history. 

The fact that he may not have shared that information with his attorneys before trial is inapposite. He has not shown that the State suppressed the evidence. See id. at ¶ 31. Moreover, he has not shown that there is a reasonable probability that, had his attorneys been aware of that information, the result of the proceeding would have been different. See id. at ¶ 31, quoting Bagley, 473 U.S. at 682. Mosley failed to produce any evidence indicating how many days’ worth of medication he was prescribed to treat his chlamydia. Nevertheless, the records attached to his motion show that he was prescribed an antibiotic almost two weeks before the rapes and continued his course of treatment for several days at the jail. Mosley’s argument that he was
still contagious when the girls were raped is purely speculative. See Jalowiec at ¶ 41. It also overlooks the overwhelming evidence against him at trial, including DNA evidence and the fact that both girls positively identified him. See State v. Prade, 9th Dist. Summit No. 28193, 2018- Ohio-3551, ¶ 55, quoting State v. Murley, 2d Dist. Champaign No. 08-CA-26, 2009-Ohio-6393, ¶ 26 (“‘[T]he mere possibility of a different outcome is insufficient’ to warrant the granting of a motion for new trial.”). Because Mosley could have discovered the jail records in the exercise of due diligence and, in any event, has not shown that they were material to his defense, we reject his argument that the trial court erred by denying his motion for new trial.

Specifically, Shutway claims that the State withheld a Use of Force Report prepared by law enforcement and an audio recording from the Clark County 9-1-1 Dispatch Center. According to Shutway, these items contained exculpatory evidence and could have been used to impeach two of the State’s witnesses. Shutway’s claim fails for multiple reasons. ",No error,"{¶ 31} Shutway admitted on the record, as well as in his brief, that he received the Champaign County Use of Force Reports from the prosecutor the day before his trial. Id. at 378-379. He also clarified on the record that he was able to obtain the Tremont City Use of Force Report prior to trial. 
Although it is unclear from Shutway’s brief which Use of Force Report he is referring to, even if we were to assume that the prosecutor willfully withheld all the Use of Force Reports discussed herein, Shutway cannot establish that the reports would have aided his defense or that he was prejudiced by the delay in receiving the reports. 
This is because the trial court held, and we agree, that the information contained in the reports was irrelevant since Shutway’s actions constituting the offenses of failure to comply and obstructing official business were already completed by the time the officers had to use force against him. 
Furthermore, because Shutway received the Use of Force Reports prior to trial, he could have moved for a trial continuance based on the late disclosure. Had he done so, any prejudice that Shutway believes he sustained from the delay in receiving the documents could have been cured. See State v. Williams, 9th Dist. Summit No. 23176, 2007-Ohio622, ¶ 19. 

{¶ 33} More importantly, the record establishes that Shutway obtained the Clark County audio recordings prior to his trial. Specifically, the record establishes that Shutway subpoenaed the Clark County audio recordings from the Tremont City Police Department, and that the department’s police chief, Greg Nelson, delivered the requested audio recordings to Shutway the day before his trial.

Because Shutway had the opportunity to review the Clark County audio recordings prior to trial, he could have used the information on the recordings to formulate his defense strategy, or, at the very least, he could have requested a trial continuance.

But I also think that, we touched on some of it, that it's admitted in
the texts that are in there, there were some of them you could see, it is kind
of a sad situation, but, I mean, these cards are essentially the currency of
the poor, and they can be exploited, and I think that's what has happened
here. And you heard Ms. Baker. What happens to these things? People in bad situations, like Ms. Hamilton, whether knowingly or willingly or
wantonly, sell what's supposed to be used for something good for be it drugs
or smoke or whatever was in those texts that he was giving out.
The most important thing is knowingly. I think when you view those
texts, when you go over the content of those texts, this is essentially a
system. You saw it on there. The texts blasted out to like ten people, ""The
smoke's in.” I hope I don't need to tell you what ""the smoke's in"" means.
And multiple references to different people about getting cards, bringing
cards, transferring cards, paying for cards. That's what this is and that's
what this code section is designed to prevent and punish and stop, to stop
the abuse of the system and this money being used for things it was never
meant to be used for and by people like the defendant that it was never
meant to be used by. T. at 243-244.
{¶31} Miranda Hamilton declined to testify at trial asserting her Fifth Amendment rights. T. at 2262. The state cites to no evidence in the record that Miranda Hamilton exchanged an Ohio Direction (SNAP) card for drugs. The state cites to no evidence in the record that Mott accepted an Ohio Direction (SNAP) card in exchange for drugs. The text exchange clearly shows Mott did not solicit Miranda Hamilton to sell or exchange her Ohio Direction (SNAP) card; rather, Miranda Hamilton sent out a text to nearly ten people offering to exchange the card for money. Further, the Ohio Direction (SNAP) card can only be used to purchase approved items; it cannot be indiscriminately used to purchase contraband, cigarettes, or alcohol. In her text message Miranda Hamilton is asking for money because, “I ain’t got no cigs and could use some cash.” T. at 191-193. In addition, the text message concerning “smoke in” was sent in July 2018 some four months before Miranda Hamilton sent the text message offering to sell her Ohio Direction (SNAP) card for cash. T. 203-204. ",Harmful error,"{¶32} The statements made by the prosecutor were therefore an improper
suggestion that Mott deals in drugs and accepts Ohio Direction (SNAP) cards as payments when there record contains no competent, credible evidence to support that statement.
{¶33} We do find that the prosecutor’s statements regarding Mott’s alleged sale or exchange of drugs was irrelevant and improper. In our disposition of Motts Second Assignment of Error, we find the “smoke in” text message was not admissible for any purpose under Evid.R. 404(B) and the purported rational relied upon by the court either invited an improper character reference or was irrelevant to a material issue in the case. 

{¶60} Due to the errors in the admission of the other acts testimony relating to drugs, giving the unredacted exhibits the jury, the prosecutor’s insinuation that Mott was exchanging drugs for food stamp cards, the jury was presented with evidence that Mott was the type of defendant who possessed and trafficked drugs and committed other
unsubstantiated offenses, resulting in prejudice. The evidence in the record cannot overcome these glaring errors",,prosecutorial misconduct,gwin,W. Scott Gwin,"Hoffman, P.J., and

Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194 (1963), and Detective Hardin's testimony.
",No error,"the record is clear that, despite the alleged prosecutorial misconduct, ineffective assistance of counsel, Brady violations, and false testimony, Stepp was not prevented from accessing the information via a public records request in 2019. There is no evidence in the record that indicates such access was limited prior to that time and Stepp has provided no evidence that an earlier public records request would not have produced the same documents he relies upon now. As this court has previously stated, ""the phrases in Crim.R. 33(B) requiring an appellant to show by 'clear and convincing proof

 ¶ 14. As a result, we conclude Stepp has failed to articulate any legitimate reason why his friend, and even himself, was incapable of discovering the evidence within the time allotted by Crim.R. 33, or at any time sooner than 12 years after his conviction.

Based on the foregoing, we hold Stepp has failed to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that he could not have learned of the existence of the newly discovered evidence within the 120-day period set forth in Crim.R. 33(B). Accordingly, we find no abuse of discretion in the trial court's decision to deny Stepp's motion for leave...

Based upon the contents of Stepp's newly-discovered evidence, we find the evidence is not exculpatory in nature, and does not disclose a strong probability that it will change the result if a new trial was granted.",,Brady v.

Appellant notes the state, during its case-in-chief, introduced a video recording of the police interrogation of appellant. Appellant argues, based on the video recording, the prosecutor asked the jury to infer guilt from his silence upon being told by a detective that he was being charged with the murder of K.W.

{¶ 55} Appellant points to the following comments by the prosecutor during closing arguments to the jury: And think about this. Think about your friends, anybody else and whether it be a gang member or not, look at that, that reaction. At 11:54, detective says, you're charged with murder. What was his reaction? Shrugs, it goes one minute and six seconds takes him to say, I didn't do it. Think about that. You're charged with murder. Everybody says you did it. I'm done talking. And he slouches over. Common sense, folks. Is that a normal reaction for getting -- somebody telling you you're charged with murder? No, it's not.
{¶ 56} Appellant specifically challenges the prosecutor's statement that appellant, upon being told he was being charged with murder, simply ""[s]hrugs"" and then responds, after ""one minute and six seconds,"" that he ""didn't do it."" (Tr. Vol. IV at 65.) Appellant acknowledges defense counsel did not object to the above comments, but argues the statements constitute plain error as an improper comment on his right to remain silent and his failure to testify. We disagree. ",No error,"{¶ 61} Appellant also challenges the prosecutor's reference to the fact appellant merely shrugged when confronted with the fact he was going to be charged with murder. The Supreme Court of Ohio, however, has held that a prosecutor ""may comment"" on matters such as a defendant's demeanor. State v. Ladson, 8th Dist. No. 105914, 2018- Ohio-1299, ¶ 38, citing State v. Green, 90 Ohio St.3d 352, 373 (2000) (""Because we are bound to follow the Ohio Supreme Court's precedent, we find that the prosecutor could comment on Ladson's demeanor and that his remarks were not improper.""); State v. Hill, 75 Ohio St.3d 195, 203 (1996). See also State v. Doak, 11th Dist. No. 2018-P 0022, 2020-Ohio-66, ¶ 58 (no error with respect to prosecutor's comment regarding defendant's quiet reaction after being told of accusation as ""prosecutor's points relate more to appellant's demeanor and the arguable peculiarity of appellant's reticence"" and were ""not obviously directed at appellant's pre-arrest silence"").
{¶ 62} Accordingly, because we conclude the prosecutor did not impermissibly comment on appellant's Fifth Amendment right to remain silent during closing arguments, appellant has failed to show error, plain or otherwise.

On appeal, the defendant argues that the prosecutor led the jury to believe, incorrectly, that the state only had to prove that the defendant did not have one of those—an immunity, license or right—to satisfy its burden of proof as to privilege because the error went uncorrected, there is “uncertainty” as to whether “the jury actually
found [the privilege] element beyond a reasonable doubt.”


Ernie Haynes’ right to a fair trial and Due Process under the
Constitutions of the United States and Ohio were violated when the trial court overruled Haynes’ objection to the prosecution misrepresenting the State’s burden of proof in closing as to the element of privilege and permitted the prosecution to proceed to claim that the State needed only to prove that Mr. Haynes did not have any one type of privilege, rather than the plain language of the instruction that requires the defendant to be without privilege of any type.",Harmless error,"While we agree that the state’s comment was erroneous, we also find that it not deprive the defendant of a fair trial. 

First, the prosecutor cured its misstatement when he asserted, correctly, that it was the state’s burden to show “beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did not have a privilege to do what he did,” and the prosecutor then quoted the statutory definition of privilege, verbatim. 

Second, the trial court also provided accurate instructions on all of the elements of the offense, including privilege, and it further instructed the jury that closing arguments are not to be considered evidence. Accord, State v. Freeman, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 91842, 2009-Ohio-5218, ¶ 16-21. 

Finally, the fact that the defendant is not challenging that the state presented legally sufficient that he acted without privilege militates against a finding that the misstatement prejudiced the outcome of this case. For these reasons, we find that the trial court did not err in overruling the defendant’s objection. Therefore, his second assignment of error is not well-taken.",,prosecutorial misconduct,Thomas J.

Durham describes several instances of purported misconduct in his brief, but he made no objection to the prosecutor's actions when they occurred. 

{¶26} Durham contends that the prosecutor inappropriately portrayed Taylor as a desperate single mother who fell victim to a scheme not of her own creation in a bid to create sympathy and bolster Taylors credibility. Upon review of the record, we find that the prosecutor's comments were consistent with the facts presented at the trial and that Durham's characterization of the comments are his interpretation of the statements

{¶27} Durham contends the prosecutor vouched for the credibility of Taylor and McClanahan when he told the jury that he did not make any promises to them in exchange for their testimony

{¶29} We reach the same result when we review Durham's argument regarding the prosecutor's comment during opening statements. Durham complains that ""the
prosecutor stated Taylor was ""telling the truth"" because ""she [handed] over a load of text messages [to Detective Smith on July 21, 2017 during Taylor's initial interview]"" but his statement is not an accurate description of the prosecutor’s comments

{¶30} Durham complains that the prosecutor improperly stated during both the opening statement and closing argument that PNC knew that he was involved with the scheme after their initial interview with Taylor, but the record does not support his characterization of the prosecutor’s statement.",No error,"{¶25} We find Durham’s allegations of prosecutorial misconduct to be based on strained interpretations of excerpts from the trial transcript, presented without relevant context and ascribed unwarranted unscrupulous intent. When we view the words of the prosecutor in the context of the trial, we find no support for Durham’s allegations. 

{¶37} We have reviewed the record and find no support for Durham’s allegations of prosecutorial misconduct. Durham removes excerpts of the transcript from their context and assigns those excerpts devious and unfair motivation to support his conclusion that the prosecutor committed acts that were so inappropriate as to rob him of a fair trial. When
the same excerpts are viewed in the context from which they were taken, the alleged misconduct vanishes and what remains are prosecutorial actions that might prompt an objection, but were not so egregious as to warrant a conclusion that Durham was the victim of prosecutorial misconduct.
{¶38} Because we have found no evidence of prosecutorial misconduct it follows that the trial court did not commit plain error. ",,prosecutorial misconduct,Baldwin,Craig R.

This is the previous graf that shows the failure to object to the prosecutor's closing argument: 
{¶44} Finally, Rike contends that his counsel was ineffective for failing to
object to the prosecutor’s closing remarks conceding that the state failed to prove a specific intent to kill, and telling the jurors that they could “solely rely upon the foreseeability that this conduct could cause death.” 
He further alleges that the remarks were a misstatement of the law. 

However, that is a mischaracterization of the prosecutor’s statements. The prosecutor reiterated that the jurors were required to find specific intent and explained that the purpose to act is known only to that person unless he expressed it to others. The prosecutor further explained that purpose is determined from the facts and circumstances, and that the jurors may infer the purpose from the surrounding circumstances, and repeatedly stated that the jurors were required to find specific intent in order to find Rike guilty.",No error,"{¶45} Because the prosecutor’s remarks were not a misstatement of the law, defense counsel had no reasonable basis to object to the remarks. Therefore, Rike failed to demonstrate that his counsel was ineffective.

Partin claims that Dr. Makoroff's opinion was a new theory of the evidence and had not been disclosed in a written report as required by Crim.R. 16(K). Partin argues the state's failure to disclose Dr. Makoroff's opinion prejudiced her defense because she had no ability to contradict Dr. Makoroff's theory with her own expert opinion or determine whether Dr. Makoroff's opinion was determined within a reasonable degree of medical certainty. Partin claims additional prejudice because the state highlighted Dr. Makoroff's opinion during closing argument. 

{¶65} THE STATE VIOLATED CRIM.R. 16 AND PREJUDICED THE DEFENDANT
WHEN IT FAILED TO DISCLOSE INFORMATION THAT IT HAD KNOWLEDGE THAT
ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL WAS WITH [HANNAH] HOURS BEFORE SHE COLLAPSED
FROM INTERNAL INJURIES, AND THAT IT KNEW [HANNAH'S] FATHER HAD LIED TO
INVESTIGATORS FOR OVER A YEAR. 

{¶66} Partin argues that the state violated the criminal discovery rules and
prejudiced her right to a fair trial when it failed to disclose that Jason lied to detectives about his whereabouts on the evening of March 7, 2018, and that a friend, Chris, was at his home on March 7, 2018. Partin asks that this court reverse her conviction and remand for a new trial. ",No error,"{¶62} Dr. Makoroff's trial testimony added some detail to the summary nature of the opinion letter. However, Crim.R. 16(K) only requires a summary of the expert opinion. And Dr. Makoroff's testimony at trial explaining her opinion was not such an elaboration that it could be said to have caused unfair surprise. In this regard, the defense was aware that Dr. Makoroff believed that the extent of bruising on Hannah was indicative of nonaccidental child abuse. The defense therefore could have sought an expert to testify as to a nonabusive cause of the extensive bruising found on Hannah's body. 
{¶63} And even if this court were to instead find that Dr. Makoroff's testimony went beyond the scope of her opinion letter, for the reasons discussed more fully in response to the fifth assignment of error, any error would be harmless. Multiple other physicians submitted corroborating expert opinions as to the nonaccidental nature of Hannah's injuries. And the state submitted significant other evidence inculpating Partin in the offenses, most notably through Partin's own statements. This court overrules Partin's first assignment of error. 

{¶73} However, the presence of Chris at 4004 Shank Road on March 7, 2018 was inconsequential given the evidence in this case. Both Partin and Jason testified that Hannah was acting completely normal that morning. The medical evidence established that Hannah would not have been walking, talking, kissing and hugging, and otherwise acting normally after receiving the injuries that led to her death. The evidence overwhelmingly established that the injuries suffered by Hannah had to have occurred in the short window of time after Jason left Hannah with Partin. Thus, the medical evidence, and Partin's own statements, served to exonerate both Jason and Chris as potential suspects. For these reasons, this court finds that the information concerning Jason's whereabouts on March 7 or that Chris was staying at the home on March 7, was immaterial and had no prejudicial effect on Partin's substantial rights. Consequently, this court overrules Partin's second assignment of error. ",,Crim.R. 16,Ringland,Robert Ringland,"Piper, J., Powell","Robin N. Piper III,Michael E. Powell",Michael T. Gmoser,Michael T.

Further, the state referred to Appellant’s pre-arrest silence during both its opening and closing arguments.

{¶77} Appellant correctly argues that Deputy Price’s testimony was offered during the state’s case-in chief in direct contravention of the Ohio Supreme Court’s holding in Leach, supra. Nonetheless, Appellant later took the stand in his own defense, thereby waiving his Fifth Amendment right. As a consequence of Appellant’s testimony at trial, the state would have committed no Fifth Amendment violation, had it offered Deputy Price’s testimony regarding Appellant’s pre-arrest silence in rebuttal to impeach Appellant’s testimony. ",Harmless error,"{¶78} Accordingly, we find that the admission of Deputy Price’s testimony during the state’s case in chief is harmless error. We are aware that the Leach Court’s prohibition on the use of pre-arrest silence during the state’s case in chief was predicated, in part, on the concern that it would cause a defendant to surrender his right not to testify and take the stand to explain his prior silence. Id. at ¶ 3. In this appeal, Appellant does not allege that he would not have testified but for Deputy Price’s testimony. In fact, Appellant’s testimony was the only testimony that did not depict him and Addison as the aggressors in the affray. Consequently, Appellant would have been obliged to testify in order to place his version of the events before the jury, regardless of the admission of Deputy Price’s testimony in the state’s case in chief. Of equal import, we further find that the remaining evidence in the record constitutes overwhelming evidence of Appellant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

prosecutor asked whether she knew appellant was convicted of a drug offense in 2011, and, in light of the clear prohibition of such evidence when a defendant does not testify, pursuant to Evid.R. 609(F), this constituted prosecutorial misconduct. The prosecutor claimed C.S. had ""opened the door"" to examine her on appellant's drug use because she testified she chose not to be around people who used drugs. The trial court disagreed and said the prosecutor could not raise appellant's past criminal record unless appellant testified. Appellant's counsel moved for a mistrial, but the trial court denied the motion, indicating it would strike the question and instruct the jury to disregard it. Appellant argues the trial court's actions were insufficient to remedy the prejudice suffered. Appellant claims that in a trial with no physical evidence, where the credibility of witnesses is of upmost importance, appellant was prejudiced by the prosecutor's actions. ",Harmless error,"{¶ 37} It is undisputed the prosecutor's question was impermissible. However, whether the prosecutor's question was intentional or misguided, we cannot find appellant was denied a fair trial. This was a single question about drug use in a case that did not involve drug charges or any allegations that drug use contributed to the offenses, thereby rendering the question harmless and of highly dubious prejudicial impact. Also, C.S. never gave an answer, and the trial court sustained defense counsel's objection, so the jury never heard any impermissible evidence. Furthermore, the trial court gave an instruction, telling the jury that it was going to strike the question and they should completely disregard it for any purpose. ""A jury is presumed to follow the instructions given to it by the trial judge."" State v. Stallings, 89 Ohio St.3d 280, 286 (2000). We have no reason to believe the jury did not follow the trial court's instructions here. Therefore, for the foregoing reasons, we find the prosecutor's improper question did not prejudice appellant or affect his substantial rights. See, e.g., State v. Kaaz, 12th Dist. No. CA2016-05-010,
2017-Ohio-5669, ¶ 66 (no error in denying motion for mistrial based on prosecutorial misconduct when the trial court immediately sustained defense counsel's objection, the witness did not answer the question, and the jury was properly instructed that attorney statements were not evidence, and there is no reason to believe the jury did not fully and faithfully follow the court's instructions); State v. Ervin, 8th Dist. No. 88618, 2007-Ohio5942, ¶ 35-38 (finding the trial court did not err when it denied a mistrial for prosecutorial misconduct when the court sustained defense counsel's objection, the
witness never answered the prosecutor's question, and the court instructed the jury to disregard any question to which the court sustained an objection); State v. Ferguson, 8th Dist. No. 80400, 2002-Ohio-4089, ¶ 8 (no ground for reversal for prosecutorial misconduct when no prejudice or substantial right affected, the court sustained the objection before the witness could answer, and the question was innocuous); State v. Chapman, 2d Dist. No. 95 CA 80 (Oct. 11, 1996) (denial of mistrial for prosecutorial misconduct proper because defendant did not demonstrate prejudice when the trial court sustained defense counsel's objection and instructed the jury the question was improper
and to disregard it, and the witness did not answer the improper question). For these reasons, we overrule appellant's fourth assignment of error.

Thacker argues that the receipts and checks should not have been admitted into evidence and he is entitled to a new trial. 

{¶75} In his fifth assignment of error, Thacker contends that during closing argument rebuttal, the prosecutor misstated evidence and improperly vouched for the victim’s credibility. He argues that the prosecutor commented that: (1) Thacker was “a determined assailant” when there was no evidence of what a determined assailant was capable of; (2) Thacker was bigger and stronger than the victim when there was no evidence of their relative strength; and (3) improperly vouched for the victim’s credibility “by discussing her ‘determination’ in pursuing these charges” against Thacker. He contends these comments deprived him of a fair trial and warrant a reversal of his conviction. 
",No error,"{¶73} According to the record, the victim testified that in October 2017, she paid Thacker for the construction work he performed on her house. Thacker’s trial counsel did not object to her testimony. When the state attempted to proffer the receipts and checks as evidence of the victim’s payments, Thacker’s trial counsel objected to those documents at a bench conference held during the victim’s testimony. The state agreed not to submit the receipts and checks and they were never admitted into evidence. Thacker has not identified any exhibits in the record to support his contention that these documents were admitted over his objection. Thus, contrary to Thacker’s contentions, we find that these documents were not admitted into evidence and Thacker suffered no prejudice. 

{¶81} No improper vouching occurred because the prosecutor did not express
any personal belief about the victim’s credibility. Rather, the prosecutor was simply responding to defense counsel’s attacks on the victim’s credibility by commenting on her determination in pursuing the charges and her lack of motive to fabricate them. See State v. Davis, 116 Ohio St.3d 404, 2008-Ohio-2, 880 N.E.2d 31, ¶ 241 (No improper vouching occurred in closing rebuttal because the prosecutor did not express any personal belief about the experts' credibility and “was simply responding to defense attacks by commenting on the experts' collective experience”).

Nichols,White,2019,Murder,Involuntary manslaughter,"Tampering with evidence, Gross abuse of a corpse, Corrupting another with drugs, trafficking in cocaine",,,Female,6 years,,2019,Summation,"{¶ 22} In his first assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court abused its discretion when it denied his motion for mistrial based on the prosecutor's alleged misconduct during closing arguments. We disagree. 
{¶ 31} A review of the record reveals that during rebuttal closing arguments, the prosecutor stated to the jury, ""[d]isturbing photographs, I hope they are disturbing to you. They should be disturbing to you. They should be disturbing and y'all should be outraged."" (Tr. at 436.) Defense counsel did not object to the foregoing remarks at the time they were made. 
{¶ 32} The prosecutor also stated to the jury, ""[t]he Judge has given you all of the law on these jury instructions. Right? That is the law that you've got to follow. And not one place in here will you find if Hanna Geiger, the victim, injected herself or because she wanted the drugs, that that means he is not culpable. You won't find that in here."" (Tr. at 439.) Defense counsel lodged a general objection to the foregoing statement,6 but the objection was overruled by the trial court. (Tr. at 439.) ",No error,"{¶ 36} Upon consideration, we find the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to grant appellant's motion for mistrial premised on the foregoing remarks made by the prosecutor during rebuttal closing argument. First, regarding appellant's contention that the prosecutor improperly invited the jury to decide the case based on emotion rather than the facts of the case or the applicable law by stating to the jurors that they should be ""outraged"" by what they saw in the photographs presented at trial, we reiterate that defense counsel made no objection to this remark at the time it was made. Accordingly, he has waived all but plain error on this point. Fudge at ¶ 49.
{¶ 37} Furthermore, we find no improper conduct on the part of the prosecutor in commenting that the jurors should be outraged in viewing the photographs. This is so, because ""outrage"" is an element of the offense of gross abuse of a corpse,7 one of the counts with which appellant had been charged. When this comment is viewed in context with the indictment, the jury instructions, and the prosecutor's earlier closing argument on this point (Tr. at409-11), it is apparent that the comment was meant to reference the element of outrage included in the offense. (Tr. at 409-11.) As the prosecutor had to prove this element, it was not improper to urge the jury that they should be outraged by the photographs they viewed because the photographs were direct evidence of the treatment of Hanna Geiger's body by appellant. Put another way, this remark by the prosecutor was an entirely fair one because it was based on "" ' ""what the evidence has shown and what reasonable inferences may be drawn therefrom."" ' "" (Further citations omitted.) Fudge at ¶ 48, quoting Muhleka at ¶ 85, quoting Lott at 165. The jurors would have understood the prosecutor's comment in this context and they would not have taken the prosecutor's comment to be an invitation to abandon their responsibility to decide the case based on the law and the facts and instead improperly decide the case based on emotion. There was no misconduct on the part of the prosecutor in urging the jurors to be outraged by the photographs of Hanna's body, and there was no error, plain or otherwise, on the part of the trial court in denying the motion for mistrial on this basis. 

{¶ 39} We find Almedom readily distinguishable from the instant matter. First and foremost, in Almedom, the offending references to the witnesses as ""victims"" were made by the trial judge, not the prosecutor. While a trial judge must remain detached and neutral in any matter before the court, the prosecutor is not constrained by any such obligation of neutrality. State v. Harper, 10th Dist. No. 01-AP-201, 2001-Ohio-8875. Secondly, in Almedom, the improper references were made throughout the entire trial. Here, the prosecutor's references to Hanna Geiger as a ""victim"" were made only during rebuttal closing argument. As discussed above, during closing argument, the prosecutor is free to comment on ""what the evidence has shown and what reasonable inferences may be drawn therefrom."" (Internal quotations and citations omitted.) Fudge at ¶ 48. In our view, the prosecutor's references to Hanna Geiger as a ""victim"" entailed fair comment on what the evidence had shown and were not improper. Thus, there was no misconduct on the part of
the prosecutor in referring to Hanna Geiger as a victim, and there was no error on the part of the trial court in denying the motion for mistrial on this basis. 

{¶ 43} In short, appellant has failed to establish any prosecutorial misconduct
during closing arguments which resulted in appellant being deprived of a fair trial. Therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellant's motion for mistrial based on alleged prosecutorial misconduct, and appellant's first assignment of error is overruled.

**

{¶ 11} Shoffner asserts the trial court improperly permitted the prosecutor to ask leading questions of M.A. during her direct examination. Specifically, Shoffner objected to the following portion of the State’s direct examination of the victim:
Q: Did [Shoffner] make any comment about you guys’ relationship?
A: No. He said one thing he said, I’m not your real uncle. That’s all he
said.
Q: Okay. Did he ever talk to you about doing any sexual acts?
",Did not reach error/conduct did not result in prejudice,"{¶ 7} While the trial court’s handling of this matter was arguably less than ideal, we disagree with Shoffner’s claim that the trial court did not conduct any hearing on his objection to the State’s exercise of the peremptory challenge. After the objection was made, the court inquired as to the State’s reasons for the peremptory strike, and the defense made no attempt to refute the State’s race-neutral bases for the dismissal. 

{¶ 9} The trial court was in the best position to weigh the credibility of the State's explanations in determining whether the State exercised its peremptory challenges with a discriminatory intent. Following a thorough review of the record, we cannot say that the trial court's decision to allow the State to exercise this peremptory challenge was clearly erroneous. Accordingly, Shoffner’s first assignment of error is overruled. 

**

{¶ 14} Clearly, the questions to which Shoffner objects were merely follow-up questions regarding information already provided by M.A. In other words, regardless of whether the questions were leading, the testimony elicited thereby had already been introduced. Thus, we cannot conclude the prosecutor improperly influenced the victim's responses, and any error in allowing the questions was harmless. ",,Batson v. Kentucky,Tucker,Michael J.

Appellant maintains the error deprived him of due process as guaranteed by the United States and Ohio Constitutions. 

**

{¶ 35} For clarity of analysis, we will address appellant's third and fifth assignments of error together. Appellant argues the prosecutor's multiple misstatements regarding disclosure of the witnesses from the board of elections and question exceeding the limiting instruction by the trial court constitute prosecutorial misconduct. Appellant contends that ""[a]bsent the claim that the witness was offered only for authentication of documents, it is
highly unlikely that the trial court would have permitted Mr. Kelly to testify at all."" (Appellant's Brief at 40.) The state has argued Kelly's testimony was solely to authenticate the documents kept by the board. The state contends that Kelly's testimony concerning the markings, or lack thereof, is within the scope of the limiting instruction to identify the document. ",Harmless error,"{¶ 25} Here, there is no dispute that Healy and Kelly were not listed in the state's initial discovery packet on October 30, 2017 or its supplemental response to appellant's request for discovery on May 21, 2019. While the state's failure to identify the witnesses constituted a violation of Crim.R. 16, there is no evidence in the record that the state's actions were willful. The state provided the relevant documents from the board of elections in discovery, and both witnesses were subpoenaed prior to trial. Even defense counsel acknowledged the nondisclosure ""was an accident, that's for sure."" (Tr. Vol. 1 at 221.) As such, we find the failure to disclose the two board of elections' witnesses was unintentional and not a willful attempt to deceive appellant. Because we have found the nondisclosure was not willful, we decline to address the two remaining Parson factors. Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing Healy and Kelly to testify at trial.

{¶ 50} Given the overwhelming evidence of appellant's guilt, we find the error was harmless. ""[E]rror is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt if the remaining evidence, standing alone, constitutes overwhelming proof of defendant's guilt."" State v.

There's a couple adages in the law in listening to [defense
counsel], they kind of come to mind. One starts with if you don't
have the facts, you argue the law. If you don't have the law, you
argue the facts. If you don't have either, you yell really loudly.
And that's essentially what you heard [defense counsel] do.
{¶59} Smith also argues the prosecutor committed misconduct when he stated:
The law demands that we protect our children. The law
demands that if you are under the age of 13 [sic] and you
engage in sexual touching or sexual conduct with a child, that *
* * is a crime. And we all know it should be.2 ",No error,"{¶60} Based on our review, we find the prosecutor's statements did not deprive Smith of a fair trial. We do not find that either remark is particularly reactionary, much less constituting plain error. As to the first statement, the prosecutor was plainly addressing the arguments made by defense counsel in his closing argument and why the state had presented its case beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Cassano, 96 Ohio St.3d 94, 2002-Ohio-3751, ¶ 101 (""[a] prosecutor can respond to issues raised by an accused."") In fact, the Ohio Supreme Court has found similar statements to be ""dismissive and reductive,"" but do not constitute plain error. State v. Ford, 158 Ohio St.3d 139, 2019-Ohio-4539, ¶ 376. We similarly find that the second statement does not constitute prosecutorial misconduct. The prosecutor's statement reflects the law that it is unlawful to engage in such sexual behaviors with children under the age of 13. It is not, as Smith argues, an improper appeal to the jury's sentiment based on their relative age disparities.
{¶61} In sum, the statements merely reflected the state's argument that sufficient and substantial evidence had been presented for the jury to return a guilty verdict. Accordingly, we find no merit to Smith's argument that he received an unfair trial on the basis of prosecutorial misconduct. Smith's fifth assignment of error is overruled.

The prosecutor asked Eades how he met Marr. Eades responded that they had met “in Madison Correctional Facility the first time.” (Trial Tr. Vol. II at 238-239.) Marr cites nothing to suggest that the prosecutor knew Eades would give this response, and the question was not improper. Eades testified on direct examination that he and Marr were friends, and the prosecutor was entitled to ask how they had met. After Eades mentioned the “Madison Correctional Facility,” the prosecutor follow up by asking, “So that’s in prison?”
Even if it were improper for the prosecutor to seek clarification that the Madison Correctional Facility was a prison, the jury already had been made aware of Eades’ prior convictions for a felony offense of violence and felony drug abuse. That being so, the fact that he had served prison time likely was not particularly surprising. 
{¶ 20} Thereafter, in his closing argument, the prosecutor suggested that it was implausible for Marr not to have known about the firearm and drugs in his truck. The prosecutor began that portion of his argument by saying: “Let me ask you this. They were driving around, per Eades, for a couple of hours that night. Are you telling me that this man who is his friend that he met in the joint doesn’t know anything that’s on him at all? (Id. at 266.) The prosecutor proceeded to cite various pieces of circumstantial evidence to establish that Marr knew about the presence of the handgun and drugs while the two men were riding around. (Id. at 266-269.) The prosecutor’s single reference in closing argument to Marr and Eades meeting in “the joint” was supported by Eades’ trial testimony. Even if the prosecutor should not have made the statement, we see no basis for a new trial. ",Did not reach error/conduct did not result in prejudice,"The prosecutor’s single reference in closing

Heinkel,Kaufhold,David T,David T Kaufhold,White,2019,Sexual violence,Rape,Sexual battery,,,Female,7 years,,2019,Summation,"{¶ 44} Kaufhold initially argues the state engaged in prosecutorial misconduct when it ""fabricated evidence"" during its closing argument when it argued that P.C. ""could"" have suffered ""a blackout"" as a result of her combining her medication with alcohol. However, as a simple review of the record reveals, that is exactly what the state's expert witness, the chief toxicologist with the Hamilton County Coroner's Office, testified to as part of the state's case-in-chief. Specifically, when asked if P.C.'s act of combining her medications with
alcohol would account for her blacking out, the toxicologist testified that it was ""possible"" that the combination caused P.C. to suffer ""unconsciousness or memory loss."" 

{¶ 46} Kaufhold also argues the state engaged in prosecutorial misconduct when it ""misstated the evidence"" and ""misled the jury"" throughout the trial and during its closing argument by improperly inferring that he may have given P.C. some type of ""date rape drug"" prior to having sex when there was no evidence to corroborate this ""theory.""

{¶ 48} Kaufhold next argues the state engaged in prosecutorial misconduct when it ""misstated the law"" by ""misstating the allegations"" in the bill of particulars when it notified the jury during its closing argument that it was not required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt exactly what incapacitating substance(s) caused P.C. to become substantially impaired in order to secure a conviction for rape in violation of R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(c). However, despite Kaufhold's claims, the record is clear that the state restricted its proof to the indictment and the allegations set forth in the bill of particulars. That is to say, the state restricted its case to proving beyond a reasonable doubt that Kaufhold had sex with P.C. when her ability to resist or consent was substantially impaired as a result of her becoming intoxicated by drugs and/or alcohol when he knew or had reasonable cause to believe that her ability to resist or consent was substantially impaired.",No error,"{¶ 45} The word ""possible"" is defined by the Merriam-Webster online dictionary as ""being within the limits of ability, capacity, or realization."" Similarly, the word ""could"" is defined by the Merriam-Webster online dictionary as the past tense of the word ""can,"" which is separately defined as being ""physically or mentally able to."" Testifying that something was ""possible"" is essentially the same as testifying that something ""could"" have happened. Or, as applied to the facts of this case, the toxicologist testifying that it was ""possible"" that P.C.'s ""unconsciousness or memory loss"" was caused by her combining medication with alcohol is essentially the same as the state arguing during its closing argument that P.C. ""could"" have suffered ""a blackout"" when she combined her medication with alcohol. Therefore, Kaufhold's claim alleging the state engaged in prosecutorial misconduct when it ""fabricated evidence"" during its closing argument by stating P.C. ""could"" have suffered ""a blackout"" as a result of her combining medication with alcohol lacks merit. 

{¶ 47} Kaufhold's argument, however, is nothing more than a challenge to the
organizational effectiveness in which the state presented its case. The fact that the state was able to present a compelling case that convinced the jury of Kaufhold's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt does not mean the state engaged in prosecutorial misconduct. There was also nothing improper about the state commenting on ""what the evidence has shown and what reasonable inferences may be drawn therefrom"" during its closing argument. State v. Lott, 51 Ohio St.3d 160, 165 (1990). This includes the possibility that Kaufhold may have given P.C. some type of ""date rape drug"" prior to having sex. Therefore, Kaufhold's claim alleging the state engaged in prosecutorial misconduct when it ""misstated the evidence"" and ""misled the jury"" by improperly inferring that he may have given P.C. some type of ""date rape drug"" lacks merit. 

{¶ 49} Exactly what incapacitating substance(s) caused P.C. to become
substantially impaired that evening, be it drugs, alcohol, or a combination of both, was not an element of the offense that the state was required to prove. That is, stated differently, proof that P.C. consumed a specific type of alcohol along with a specific type of drug is not an element that needed to be proven to secure a conviction for rape in violation of R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(c). Therefore, Kaufhold's claim that the state engaged in prosecutorial misconduct when it ""misstated the law"" by ""misstating the allegations"" in the bill of particulars during its closing argument when it notified the jury that it was not required to
prove beyond a reasonable doubt exactly what caused P.C. to become substantially impaired in order to secure a conviction for rape in violation of R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(c) lacks merit.

prosecutorial misconduct by inaccurately stating law to the jury during closing argument. He contends the state improperly imposed a duty on Taylor to assist William after he was cut where there was no such duty of care. Again, Taylor objects to the prosecutor’s hit-and-run analogy. ",No error,"As explained in the previous assignment of error, the hit-and-run
analogy illustrated the point that when someone causes injury to another, he or she must mitigate the harm caused to the victim or be held responsible for the consequences resulting from the harm and subsequent failure to render aid. 

The argument was consistent with the felony murder statute, which holds an offender criminally liable for a victim’s death if the death resulted from the offender’s “committing * * * an offense of violence that is a felony of the first or second degree * * *.” R.C. 2903.02(B). Although there is no express duty to render a victim assistance under the statute, the failure to render life-saving aid will result in a felony murder conviction if the victim’s death was proximately caused by the defendant’s violent criminal acts. We, therefore, cannot say that the prosecutor’s hit-and-run analogy was improper under the circumstances of this case nor can we say that Taylor was prejudiced by it.

In these assignments of error, Appellant asserts that the actions of Attorney Desmond that allegedly led to his termination shows Attorney Desmond committed serial misconduct. Appellant asserts had he known of Attorney Desmond’s actions he would not have accepted the plea agreement. Appellant argues there was prosecutorial misconduct by continually offering his proffered testimony. He contends there was prosecutorial misconduct in this case and other cases. He further asserts he was denied the right to the grand jury transcripts, a Kastigar hearing, and his plea was coerced. 

{¶11} The state counters asserting the majority of the attachments to the postconviction petition were contained in the record. The only three items that were outside the record concerned Rose Panezich, Appellant’s mother. The state contends this evidence does not constitute a constitutional violation. 

{¶13} As to the attachments that relate to Rose Panezich, Appellant claims these documents demonstrate that there was prosecutorial misconduct to coerce a plea. He contends they are evidence that she was threatened with a probation violation if she did not cooperate and testify truthfully before the grand jury and that her possible incarceration was used to get him to enter a plea. ",No error,"Part of Rose Panezich's plea agreement and a condition
of her probation may have been to cooperate with the state against any and all co-defendants and accomplices, which would include Appellant. This is a common condition set forth in plea agreements and probation. If she did not cooperate at the grand jury proceedings or if she did not cooperate at the interview with the prosecutor in preparation for the grand jury proceedings, then there would be a basis for a probation violation.
Furthermore, part of Appellant's argument is that it was coercive to indicate his mother would not be released from incarceration unless he pled guilty. The state's indication that it would support her release if he pled guilty does not amount to coercion if there is no evidence showing Appellant was incompetent or incapable of making his own decision.


The state argues the assertion that Appellant was entitled to grand jury transcripts is barred by res judicata. As to Attorney Desmond and the Mahoning County Prosecutor’s Office, that information and allegations are outside the record and no evidence of these were submitted to the trial court to support the petition. 
**

{¶19} Lastly, as to the allegations regarding Attorney Desmond, those allegations lack any support. The reasons and basis for Attorney Desmond’s termination from the Mahoning County Prosecutor’s Office are a matter outside the record, but Appellant offered no evidence other than bare allegations regarding the termination to support his claim that he is entitled to post-conviction relief. Therefore, Appellant has not met his burden regarding this matter. ",,prosecutorial misconduct,Carol Ann Robb,Carol Ann Robb ,"Gene Donofrio, Cheryl Waite","Gene Donofrio,Cheryl L. Waite",Paul J.

Cummings,Walker,Thomas,Thomas Walker,Black,2016,Murder,Murder,"Gross abuse of a corpse, tampering with evidence, having weapons while under a disability",,,Female,25 years to life,,2016,Summation,"{¶36} In his first assignment of error, Walker contends that prosecutorial
misconduct in closing arguments denied him a fair trial. He argues that prosecutor improperly stated that she was not lying, thereby implying that defense counsel was lying, and denigrated the defendant. This assignment of error is not well taken. 
{¶38} Walker takes issue with two comments in the prosecutor’s rebuttal
argument. First, the prosecutor stated, “[A]nd I am not making up things. Please use your collective memory and not—I don’t—it is not my job to just come here and lie to you.” 

**

{¶42} Next, Walker takes issue with the following comment in the
prosecutor’s rebuttal argument. She stated, “That is how he felt about Necole. Not this little, ooh, boo-hoo in court where he is [c]rying. Where never did he ever show any remorse in any of his three interviews.” Prior to this statement, the prosecutor was talking about Walker’s text messages with degrading comments about Necole. ",No error,"{¶40} The trial court overruled the objection, and then the prosecutor
continued with “With Necole before Walker—and I am not making up things. Please use your collective memory and not—I don’t—it is not my job to just come up here and just lie to you.” After the trial court overruled Walker’s objection and refused to give a curative instruction, the prosecutor discussed the family’s testimony about Necole’s changed behavior after she met Walker.
{¶41} The prosecutor’s comment was a direct response to the defense
counsel’s argument, and thus, it was not improper. See State v. Hopkins, 2018-Ohio-1864, 112 N.E.3d 98, ¶ 97-99 (2d Dist.); State v. Carter, 2017-Ohio-1328, 88 N.E.3d 513, ¶ 23 (1st Dist.). The rest of her statements were fair comments on the evidence. 

**

{¶43} First, Walker did not object to this comment, so we review it for plain
error. State v. Underwood, 3 Ohio St.3d 12, 13, 444 N.E.2d 1332 (1983); State v. Thomas, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-120561, 2013-Ohio-5386, ¶ 38. The statement was a fair comment on the evidence. Further, it is not improper for a prosecutor to comment on the defendant’s lack of remorse. See State v. Bryan, 101 Ohio St.3d 272, 2004-Ohio-971, 804 N.E.2d 433, ¶ 184; State v. Awkal, 76 Ohio St.3d 324, 335-336, 667 N.E.2d 960 (1996). We cannot hold that the comment was improper much less that it rose to the level of plain error.
{¶44} Further, even if the prosecutor’s comments were improper, they were
two isolated remarks in an otherwise proper argument. “Isolated comments by a prosecutor are not to be taken out of context and given their most damaging
meaning.” State v. Carter, 89 Ohio St.3d 593, 603, 734 N.E.2d 345 (2000). None of the comments that Walker complains about were so egregious as to affect his substantial rights or deny him a fair trial. Further, the trial court instructed the jury that opening and closing arguments are not evidence. We presume that the jury followed that instruction. See State v. Garner, 74 Ohio St.3d 49, 59, 656 N.E.2d 623 (1995); State v. Bell, 2015-Ohio-1711, 34 N.E.3d 405, ¶ 21 (1st Dist.). Therefore, we overrule Walker’s first assignment of error.

The alleged new document ""Summary 86"" describes a May 17, 2001 interview by Columbus Police Department Homicide Detective Ed Kallay (who testified at Bethel's trial), two federal ATF officers, and a Franklin County Jail inmate named Ronald Withers. The ""Firm or Victim[s]"" named in the summary are the homicide victims Hawks and Reynolds, and the ""place of occurrence"" named is the location where the bodies of Hawks and Reynolds were discovered. During the interview, Withers claims he was in the same cell as Chavis for three weeks, and reported Chavis told him ""when he shot the individual he was already dead[,] * * * that his cousin was the other shooter, and his cousin was also incarcerated."" (Attachment to Sept. 10, 2018 Mot. at 16.) As noted above, Chavis' cousin is Langbein, not Bethel, and Bethel contends Summary 86 constitutes additional proof Langbein and Chavis killed Hawks and Reynolds, not Bethel and Chavis. ",Did not reach error/conduct did not result in prejudice,"{¶ 28} As a result, we cannot say the trial court abused its discretion, either in concluding Bethel has not shown by clear and convincing evidence he was unavoidably prevented from the discovery of Summary 86, or in concluding Summary 86 fails to create a reasonable probability of a different result at Bethel's trial. 

Similarly, Bethel cannot show by clear and convincing evidence that, but for constitutional error at trial, no reasonable jury would have found him guilty or eligible for a death sentence. And we cannot say the state's failure to disclose this evidence prior to trial is in violation of Brady, because Bethel cannot demonstrate prejudice as a result of the State's failure to disclose.

JUDGE DONNELLY DISSENTS -suggested that the fact that the defendant was unable to access exculpatory evidence could've changed the ruling of the court because others confessed to have committed the murder. ""The materials suppressed by the state were two reports of police interviews with people who indicated that Jeremy Chavis and Donald Langbein had confessed to murdering Reynolds and Hawk and had implicated each other in their confessions. Langbein was the state’s star witness against Bethel at trial.""


The appellant, Robert Bethel, is specifically appealing the decision of the court denying his motion for leave to file motion for a new trial and his petition for postconviction relief. The assignments of error are not strictly prosecutorial misconduct, but the court does rule that they cannot say whether that the state's failure to disclose evidence is a violation of Brady, since Bethel can't demonstrate prejudice.

erred by permitting the state to use a peremptory challenge to dismiss a prospectiveAfrican-American juror. He argues that the state failed to provide a legitimate and credible race-neutral reason for striking the juror. This assignment of error is not well taken.

**

{¶40} In his third assignment of error, Williams contends that he was denied a fair trial due to prosecutorial misconduct. He argues that the trial court permitted the prosecutor to argue about matters not in evidence, as well as irrelevant and improper character evidence, and to disparage defense counsel in front of the jury.
This assignment of error is not well taken. 

{¶43} Most of the comments about which Williams complains were not
improper. Nevertheless, the prosecutor made statements to the effect that the defense attorneys were “just doing their job.” Those comments were improper since they imputed insincerity to defense counsel by suggesting that counsel believed that Williams was guilty. See State v. Clemons, 82 Ohio St.3d 438, 452, 696 N.E.2d 1009 (1998); Keenan at 405-406. Comments to that effect by the prosecutor were improper. ",Harmless error,"{¶30} Thus, the prosecutor provided race-neutral reasons for use of the
peremptory challenge. Courts have upheld the denial of Batson challenges for similar reasons. See May at ¶ 51; State v. Tibbs, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-100378, 2011-Ohio-6716, ¶ 25; State v. Jordan, 167 Ohio App.3d 157, 2006-Ohio-2759, 854 N.E.2d 520, ¶ 39 (1st Dist.). 
This court has specifically stated that a juror’s lack of candor or dishonesty in voir dire is a valid race-neutral reason for challenging that juror. Tibbs at ¶ 25; Jordan at ¶ 39. The trial court’s acceptance of those race neutral reasons was not clearly erroneous, and we overrule Williams’s first assignment of error. 

** COMMENTS IN REBUTTAL CLOSING ARGUMENT (found in transcripts)

{¶44} But even though some of the prosecutor’s comments were improper, none were so egregious as to affect Williams’s substantial rights or to deny him a fair trial, much less rise to the level of plain error. See State v. Rogers, 143 Ohio St.3d 385, 2015-Ohio-2459, 38 N.E.3d 860, ¶ 22; Wright, 2017-Ohio-1568, 90 N.E.3d 162, at ¶ 53. Consequently, we overrule Williams's fifth assignment of error.

JURY SELECTION: ruling is no error.

{¶ 30} In the comments Harner argues were improper and prejudicial, the prosecutor stated that Harner was running a ""chop-shop"" with his girlfriend and discussed Martin's credibility and the fact that charges against her had been dismissed, but she would ""have her day in court."" Harner further argues that he was prejudiced by comments that Martin and Harner were trying to ""pull the wool over your eyes because they think they're smarter than everyone else"" and ""can make fake documents and pass them off at the BMV in order to cover their tracks."" The prosecutor further commented that when the detective was called to the stand on rebuttal, Harner and Martin ""couldn't quit talking and looking at each other"" because they knew Eastes had items to prove they lied to the jury. ",No error,"{¶ 35} We find no error in the prosecutor's comments. The trial court sustained an initial objection and the prosecutor then clarified that Harner did not have the burden of proof. The following discussion in closing arguments related to the believability and credibility of the testimony.

",No error,"{¶34} First, in examining the nature of these remarks, we note that the challenged comment was stated in closing arguments, which jurors are instructed not to consider as evidence. The trial court instructed the jury that the evidence in Appellant’s case does not include the indictment, opening statements, or the closing arguments. Moreover, the trial court told the jury that they were the sole judges of the facts, the credibility of the witnesses, and the weight of the evidence. We presume that the jury followed the court's
instructions. State v. Loza (1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 61, 79, 641 N.E.2d 1082. 
{¶35} Upon review, we find that while the comments of the prosecutor in the case at bar may have raised objection, we cannot conclude that they were so outside the latitude generally granted the prosecution such that they comprise plain error.
{¶36} Further, Appellant's trial counsel's decision to not object to these comments and thus bring more attention to them can be viewed as a reasonable trial strategy, which cannot serve as the basis for error.

{¶32} During the state’s rebuttal closing argument, the Prosecutor remarked:
 And so I leave you with this. Imagine that those bruises are on your
back. You’ve been sitting here for two days. Would your back be against
the back of that chair? If your back looked like that, would you have slept
on your back the past two nights? Would you be eating handfuls of Tylenol? If your back * * * If your back looked like that, would you be holding yourself still, trying not to move, trying not to flinch and cause a flash of pain. Now imaging [sic] if you were twenty-three months old. Thank you. 

{¶34} The trial court overruled defense counsel’s objection to the Prosecutor’s remarks.
{¶35} The trial court instructed the jury, in pertinent part: 
Evidence is all the testimony received from the witnesses, the
exhibits admitted during trial, facts agreed to by counsel, and any facts
which the court requires you to accept as true. Evidence may be direct or
circumstantial or both. Direct evidence is the testimony given by a witness
who has seen or heard the facts about which the witness testifies. It
includes exhibits admitted into evidence during trial. Circumstantial
evidence is proof of facts or circumstances by direct evidence from which
you may reasonably infer other related or connected facts which naturally
and logically follow, according to the common experience of people. To
infer or to make an inference is to reach a reasonable conclusion of fact
which you may but are not required to make from other facts which you find
have been established by direct evidence. * * * The evidence does not
include the indictment, opening statements, or closing arguments of
counsel. The opening statements and closing arguments are designed to
assist you. ",Harmless error,"{¶37} We find the prosecutor’s comment was tantamount to asking the jurors to place themselves in the shoes of the victim. We find such was improper. See, State v. Hart, 8th Dist. No 79564, 2002-Ohio-1084, *3.

THEREFORE, FALSE EVIDENCE WAS PRESENTED BY THE STATE. ",No error,"{¶ 46} Brown's second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth assignments of error appear to be interrelated. Once again, these assignments of error involve the past allegation of sexual abuse, which he maintains was false. Brown alleges that a detective ""falsified"" a police report when referencing the prior allegation of sexual abuse.2 Brown claims that this false allegation prevented character witnesses from being called on his behalf at trial. Brown blames the detective, the state, the trial court, and his own trial counsel for not being able
to present character witnesses. The trial court found that none of these arguments raised by Brown were new and did not support a finding that he was unavoidably prevented from discovering the evidence at issue. As noted by the trial court, Brown's allegations are simply not relevant because the decision not to call witnesses was a strategic decision made at trial. For those reasons, and the fact that Brown could have raised these issues in his initial appeal and are therefore res judicata, we agree with the trial court. Brown's second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth assignments of error related to his motion for a new trial are overruled. 
{¶ 48} We decline to entertain Brown's speculation. From the record, we cannot discern the existence of any report that was improperly denied him that would support his arguments for a new trial. Brown has raised similar arguments in his direct appeal and in his first petition for postconviction relief. However, Brown presents this court with no newly discovered evidence that remotely supports his claim, much less the type of evidence that presents a ""strong probability"" of reversal. Accordingly, Brown's seventh and ninth assignments of error are overruled. 
{¶ 50} In his tenth and eleventh assignments of error, Brown once again argues that he suffered from Barium poisoning and claims the state committed prosecutorial misconduct and denied him due process of law. We have previously addressed similar arguments with respect to alleged Barium poisoning in the context of Brown's claim that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. Brown, 2018-Ohio-3338 at ¶ 26. Once again, res judicata bars a petitioner from ""re-packaging"" evidence or issues that either were or could have been raised. Casey, 2018-Ohio-2084 at ¶ 15. Furthermore, his claims in this appeal do not constitute newly discovered evidence. Brown's tenth and eleventh assignments of error are overruled. ",,prosecutorial misconduct,Ringland,Robert Ringland,Hendrickson and Piper,"Robert A. Hendrickson,Robin N. Piper III",Martin P. Votel,Martin Patrick Votel,"g.a: These allegations of prosecutorial misconduct are all a bit convoluted. Appellant claims discovery error and that the prosecutor presented a report as true when they knew it wasn't. It seems these arguments have been raised in previous appeals and postconviction relief appeals, in which the court had previously found them to not constitute as error or as newly discovered evidence. 

p.m: Allegation of Crim. 16 would be no error. The ""other"" in this case would be the defendant blaming the prosecutor for giving false evidence. Some other allegations of prosecutorial misconduct seem to be barred.

Keeton,White,2019,Robbery/theft,Aggravated robbery,Misuse of a credit card,,,,7 years,,2019,"Opening statements,Summation","{¶ 31} Keeton first claims that, during voir dire, the prosecutor improperly
expressed a personal opinion about the strength of the State’s evidence by stating, “I believe, of course, I have sufficient evidence.” Tr. p. 69. A reading of the entire passage indicates that immediately prior to the cited statement, the prosecutor discussed the State’s burden of proof. And, immediately after the statement, the prosecutor stated that regardless of his belief regarding the sufficiency of the evidence, the jurors were the triers of fact and it was their job to decide whether the State had met its burden. We conclude that Keeton has not demonstrated misconduct with regard to this statement. 
{¶ 32} Next, Keeton objects to a statement made by the prosecutor during opening statements. Specifically, the prosecutor stated, “I can tell you that the evidence in this case is pretty overwhelming, that these people robbed this guy.” In reading the entirety of this passage, we note that prior to the statement, the prosecutor had been discussing the evidence the State intended to submit during the trial. The prosecutor ended the passage by correctly stating that it had the burden of proof to convince the jurors of Keeton’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Again, we find no misconduct. 
{¶ 33} Keeton also contends that the prosecutor acted improperly during closing argument by stating “* * * I believe that you have more than enough evidence, more than enough proof beyond a reasonable doubt that these two guys robbed this Johnny Wright, used the debit card and stole his money.” As with the statements above, we conclude the prosecutor was merely commenting that, based upon the evidence presented, the State had met its burden of proof. This does not constitute misconduct.
{¶ 34} Finally, Keeton complains that during rebuttal closing argument, the
prosecutor stated, “I get the last word to talk about the garbage and mischaracterization that you just heard from the defense attorneys.” Tr. p. 527. The prosecutor also referred to the closing argument made by both defense counsel as “absurd”.",No error,"See paragraph 31-34; the court holding is at the end of each allegation paragraph. In addition to:

{¶ 35} We have stated that it is improper for a “prosecutor [to] continuously
characterize[e] the defense theory as one of deception,” and we have also stated that “[w]hile a prosecutor may urge the jury to give little or no weight to the defense's case, ** * attempts by the prosecutor to persuade the jury that the defense is trying to mislead them [are] improper.” (Citations omitted.) State v. Ward, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 18211, 2001 WL 220244, *6 (Mar. 2, 2001). The prosecutor’s statements suggesting that defense counsel “mischaracterized” the evidence and that defense counsel’s arguments were “absurd” were within the wide latitude a prosecutor is afforded during closing
argument. On the other hand, calling the defense arguments “garbage” arguably constituted an improper attempt to convince the jury that defense counsel was attempting to mislead. However, we cannot conclude that the prosecutor’s one-time use of the word “garbage” amounts to plain error. ",,prosecutorial misconduct,Tucker,Michael J. Tucker,Hall and Welbaum,"Michael T.

We note appellant did not object to the alleged improper comments at trial. If trial counsel fails to object to the alleged instances of prosecutorial misconduct, the alleged improprieties are waived, absent plain error. State v. White, 82 Ohio St.3d 16, 22, 1998–Ohio–363, 693
 N.E.2d 772 (1998), citing State v. Slagle, 65 Ohio St.3d 597, 604, 605 N.E.2d 
 916 (1992). 
{¶37} First, appellant argues the prosecutor undermined the presumption of
innocence in opening statement with the assertion that “just because we are down here and having a trial does not mean that there is a great big mystery to solve,” a comment that was repeated in closing argument. We disagree with appellant’s characterization and find the comment to be innocuous in the context of the entire opening statement and closing argument. Appellant further argues the prosecutor vouched for Thomas’ credibility by reminding the jury that Moorehead found Thomas to be a truthful person, and inflamed the jury with reference to appellant’s “outrageous conduct.” In the context of the trial as a whole, we find appellant’s argument to be overstating the import of these comments. The prosecutor’s statements were also accurate summaries of the evidence. 
{¶38} Appellant fails to point to any improper statement by the prosecutor which is not arguably supported by appellee's evidence. State v. Meeks, 5th Dist. No. 2014CA00017, 2015-Ohio-1527, 34 N.E.3d 382, ¶ 103. In closing argument, a prosecutor may comment on “what the evidence has shown and what reasonable inferences may be drawn therefrom.” Id., citing State v. Lott, 51 Ohio St.3d 160, 165, 555 N.E.2d 293 (1990). Appellant argues the prosecutor vouched for Thomas’ credibility during her direct examination but we again disagree with his characterizations of the record. Upon our review, we find the cited comments to be reasonable inferences from the evidence. ",No error,"{¶39} Finally, appellant has failed to demonstrate prejudice based upon any of the prosecutor's comments he cites. “Appellant does not identify any connection between the alleged misconduct and his conviction. * * * *. [T]he trial court clearly believed, and the record reflects, that the prosecutor's theory of the case was relevant as to certain issues. Appellant's pure speculation as to how the jury might overreact to this evidence is not the
kind of ‘but for’ argument that will support a finding of misconduct.” Meeks, supra, 2015- Ohio-1527 at ¶ 105, citing State v. Carmichael, 7th Dist. Columbiana No. 11 CO 23, 2013- Ohio-2178, 2013 WL 2325849, ¶ 14. None of the evidence or arguments cited by appellant are improper, and appellant cannot demonstrate, even if they were improper, “but for” the evidence and arguments he would not have been convicted. Having failed to demonstrate a causal connection between the alleged misconduct and his resulting convictions, appellant cannot demonstrate reversible error. 
{¶40} If a prosecutor's comments are found to be improper, it is not enough that there is sufficient evidence to otherwise sustain a conviction. “Instead, it must be clear beyond a reasonable doubt that absent the prosecutor's comments, the jury would have found defendant guilty.” State v. Clay, 181 Ohio App.3d 563, 2009–Ohio–1235, 910 N.E.2d 14 at ¶ 49 (8th Dist.), citing State v. Smith, 14 Ohio St.3d 13, 470 N.E.2d 883 (1984). Appellant cannot demonstrate, even if any of the cited comments were improper, “but for” the comments he would not have been convicted. Appellee presented substantial uncontroverted evidence of appellant’s guilt. Having failed to demonstrate a causal connection between the alleged misconduct and his resulting convictions, therefore, appellant cannot demonstrate reversible error.

{¶ 53} During the opening statement, the prosecutor stated that before C.B.’s rape, Schambers left Durst and C.B. alone in the back seat of Durst’s car, and promised to return in five minutes. The prosecutor then stated:
 And when [Schambers returns], [she] can see that the defendant is
having - - he’s having sex with [C.B.] in the back seat of the car.
 [Schambers] goes around to the back, because the defendant doesn’t
stop. [She] goes around to the back of the car and grabs the defendant and
pulls him backwards and said, You need to stop. We need to go home.
There’s another car coming. And there was. Somebody else was arriving.
With that the rape ends. (Vol. I, Opening Statement at 248; emphasis
added).
{¶ 54} The prosecutor’s statement, however, did not match Schambers’
testimony on that point. Schambers testified that, when she returned to the car and observed Durst on top of C.B., she, i.e., Schambers, “didn’t touch him, but * * * told him to get off of her.” The point was made again during re-cross
examination: 
Q. Ms. Schambers, you say you didn’t physically intervene when
you returned and found them in that position? * * *
 A. No.
 Q. Okay. You didn’t grab [Durst] from, like, the back of his shirt
and try to physically pull him off?
 A. Not that I can recall.
 Q. If somebody else testified to that, they’re wrong.
 A. I didn’t say that. ",No error,"{¶ 55} Although the state acknowledges that the prosecutor’s assertion during
opening statements was not a fair characterization of the evidence, it argues that the prosecutor’s overstatement did not prejudice Durst. We agree. 
{¶ 56} Before opening statements began, the trial court properly instructed the jury that opening statements were not evidence, but were merely a “preview” of what each side believed the evidence would show. See, e.g., State v. Frazier, 73 Ohio St.3d 323, 338, 652 N.E.2d 1000 (1995). We find that the instruction, combined with Schambers’ clear testimony—that she had no physical contact with Durst—cured any overstatement by the prosecutor. Accord State v. Morgan, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 19416, 2004-Ohio-461, ¶ 41 (Overstatement by prosecutor that hair sample was an “identical” match to the defendant was not prejudicial where court instructed jury that opening statements were not evidence and where crime lab technician disputed that hair sample was identical.). Moreover, whether Schambers made any physical contact with Durst is irrelevant to the state’s rape case against him.

Peyatt,White,2019,Sexual violence,Gross sexual imposition,"Attempted gross sexual imposition, disseminating matter harmful to juveniles",,checked,Female,22.5 years,,2019,"Opening statements,Summation","{¶21} In these assignments of error, Appellant contends improper statements were made during opening statements and closing argument that prejudiced the jury against him. He argues appellate counsel should have raised the argument that these improper statements prejudiced him in the direct appeal. 

{¶23} As to opening statement, there are three comments the prosecutor made that Appellant is complaining are improper.
{¶24} The first comment was a reference to a statement K.B. made to her mother about Appellant raping her. Appellant was acquitted of the rape. Therefore, it is difficult to conclude that any prejudice resulted from this statement.
{¶25} The second comment was about the Sherriff’s Department being unable to obtain evidence from an inoperable laptop and tablet that were legally seized during the execution of a search warrant. It is unclear how this statement is prejudicial when the state was admitting no evidence could be seized from the items.
{¶26} The last statement concerned the statement that the state suspected Appellant raped K.B. prior to her being 13 years of age. When read in the entire context, the state was indicating that while one rape might have occurred prior to her turning 13 years of age, the rape that it was attempting to prove occurred after she was 13 years of age. As discussed above, K.B.’s testimony regarding her age as to when events occurred varied; she was not always sure of her age. While the state should not have stated that it suspected she was raped prior to turning 13 years of age, the statement was made to show that it had to prove she was under 13 years of age for the gross sexual imposition charges, but not for the rape charge. Furthermore, as with the first statement, Appellant was not convicted of rape so it is unclear how he was prejudiced. 
{¶27} As to closing argument, Appellant alleged many comments that he contends prejudiced the jury against them. For a prosecutor's closing argument to be prejudicial, the remarks must be “so inflammatory as to render the jury's decision a product solely of passion and prejudice.” State v. Williams, 23 Ohio St.3d 16, 20, 490 N.E.2d 906 (1986). To determine whether the remarks were prejudicial, the closing argument must be viewed in its entirety. State v. Slagle, 65 Ohio St.3d 597, 607, 605 N.E.2d 916 (1992). ",No error,"{¶28} In reviewing the closing argument in its entirety and in the context of the arguments made by Appellant’s counsel, the statements complained of were a summarization of the evidence and conclusions drawn from what that evidence showed. During closing argument, the state can summarize the evidence and draw conclusions as to what the evidence shows. State v. Hand, 107 Ohio St.3d 378, 2006-Ohio-18, ¶ 116. Furthermore, none of the statements can be characterized, together or on their own, as “so inflammatory as to render the jury's decision a product solely of passion and prejudice.” Thus, it cannot be concluded that the statements made during closing argument prejudiced Appellant.
{¶29} These assignments of error are meritless. The prosecutor did not make improper statements during opening or closing that prejudiced Appellant. In these assignments of error Appellant has failed to demonstrate a colorable claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.

He contends that certain statements made by the prosecutor during closing about the deadly effects of drugs were misconduct and that a mistrial should have been granted. 

{¶ 67} During opening statements in this case, the prosecution made comments about one defendant supporting her lifestyle through involvement with one of the other defendants and his drug dealing. 

The defense replied during closing that the prosecution had failed to establish any lavish lifestyle enjoyed by any defendants as a way to suggest that they were not guilty of the extensive drug trafficking with which they had been charged. 

Then, on rebuttal the prosecutor made the following remarks:
I would suggest to you that any lifestyle built - - predicated
solely on the misery and death of other people is the wrong kind
of lifestyle. That's what heroin is. Any lifestyle she's living - -
and the call that I'm going to talk about, I think, expressly tells
you why I'm saying this. Any lifestyle she or he are living based
on other people's misery is illegal.
The point of selling drugs is to make money. The effect of
selling drugs is killing people. ",Did not reach error/conduct did not result in prejudice,"{¶ 68} The prosecution had introduced no testimony regarding the health effects of heroin or drug dealing. It also had not introduced evidence to tie any drugs sold by any defendant to any overdose or other drug-related death. 

Thus, the prosecutor's argument assumed facts not in evidence and was, in that sense, arguably improper and somewhat inflammatory. Yet, we do not find it necessary to further address that point because we do not find prejudice to Burney's substantial rights.

 This was a single remark which was uttered one time in nearly 70 pages of closing argument by the state in the larger context of a four-week trial comprising a transcript of several thousand pages. Moreover, the content of the remark likely did not inject into the minds of the jurors any ideas with which they were not already acquainted concerning the illegal drug, heroin. Therefore, we overrule Burney's fourth assignment of error. ",,prosecutorial misconduct,Brown,Susan Diane Brown,Sadler and Brunner,"Lisa L.

(Appellant's Brief at 5.) Appellant did not object to these alleged instances of prosecutorial misconduct, but he argues reversal is nevertheless required under the plain error standard of review since, given that his convictions ""hinged entirely on the credibility of one State's witness,"" there is a reasonable probability the prosecutorial misconduct affected the outcome of the trial. (Appellant's Brief at 5.) 

{¶ 39} Appellant contends Ms. Hager testified at trial that ""she would have to serve eight years, and that her sentence would not be subject to reduction through judicial release,"" and the prosecutor was aware this was a false statement and had a duty to correct it. (Appellant's Brief at 9.) Specifically, appellant argues the state was aware Ms. Hager pleaded guilty to abduction and involuntary manslaughter, neither of which, according to appellant, involved mandatory prison time. In appellant's view, given Ms. Hager was sentenced to eight years, she could apply for release after five years under R.C. 2929.20(C)(4),4 which given her time served, Ms. Hager could theoretically apply for release approximately two years after her testimony

{¶ 44} Appellant argues the prosecutor improperly vouched for its primary witness, Ms. Hager, during closing argument, and the jury may have believed the prosecutor was basing her statements either on evidence outside of the record or her years of experience. According to appellant, there is ""no reason to believe that the jury did not consider that information when making its credibility determination regarding Ms. Hager's testimony."" (Emphasis sic.) (Appellant's Brief at 11.) ",No error,"{¶ 38} In other words, the context of the statements shows the prosecutor's comments presented the jury a theory it would attempt to prove, rather than a statement as to appellant's criminality that destroyed his presumption of innocence, as contended by appellant. On this record, we find appellant has not demonstrated plain error in regard to the prosecutor's pirate analogy and ""partner[s] in crime"" reference. (Appellant's Brief at 8.) 

{¶ 43} Based on this record, even assuming, arguendo, that not all of Ms. Hager's eight-year sentence is mandatory, contrary to appellant's argument we do not consider the cited testimony to be a material falsehood. First, the cited statement is not plainly a false statement. Ms. Hager's testimony arguably encompasses her personal belief that she did not qualify for judicial release based on her conversations with her attorney. See Iacona at 97 (finding no prosecutorial misconduct where the witness gave an answer as far as he knew, which was ""by its own terms, limited to his own personal knowledge""). Second, Ms. Hager testified she was motivated to tell the truth at least in part by her desire to complete her sentence and get out of jail, and we fail to see how the state's not clarifying her ability to potentially get out of jail sooner materially affected this proceeding on this record. Third, the jury had available for reference, as an admitted exhibit, Ms. Hager's guilty plea form that shows the particulars of Ms. Hager's sentence. Thus, even if the prosecutor had a duty to clarify Ms. Hager's statement on judicial release, we cannot say the failure to do affected appellant's substantial rights. Considering all the above, we find appellant has not demonstrated plain error in regard to the prosecutor failing to correct Ms. Hager's statement on judicial release. 

{¶ 51} Overall, based on a review of the record and considering the complained of statements within the context of the entire trial, we cannot conclude that the prosecutor's statements, in isolation or cumulatively, when reviewed under the plain error standard, rose to the level of prosecutorial misconduct meriting a new trial.

Rasawehr,White,2019,Other,Menacing by stalking,Telecommunications harassment,,,,5 years of community control sanctions,,2019,Summation,"{¶10} Accordingly, we turn to Rasawehr’s argument that the State’s
suggestion in its closing argument that the affirmative-defense instruction applied to his menacing-by-stalking and telecommunications-harassment charges amounts to structural error. 

However, Rasawehr cites no authority that the principle of structural error applies to this type of error, and we see none.  ",Did not reach error/conduct did not result in prejudice,"{¶14} Here, Rasawehr directs us to the beginning of the State’s closing
argument during which it recites the First Amendment and acknowledges
Rasawehr’s theory of the cases as being about the First Amendment. 

However, contrary to Rasawehr’s argument on appeal, the State did not reference Rasawehr’s argument that his conduct was privileged under the First Amendment as an affirmative defense at that juncture of its closing argument. Rather, the State was responding to the evidence presented at trial by Rasawehr that his conduct was privileged under the First Amendment, which it is permitted to do. Moreover, the only reference to the issue appears in the State’s rebuttal-closing argument in relation to case number 16CRB00943, which is not before us. (See May 21-24, 2019 Tr., Vol. IV, at 1002-1003). Accordingly, we cannot say that the State’s remarks were improper. 

{¶15} Nevertheless, even if the State’s remarks were improper, Rasawehr
cannot demonstrate that he was prejudiced by the State’s closing argument—that is, Rasawehr cannot demonstrate that the outcome of his trial would have been different. See State v. Thompson, 3d Dist. Henry No. 7-16-10, 2017-Ohio-792, ¶26. Indeed, in its jury instructions, the trial court not only instructed the jury that the affirmative-defense instruction applied only as to case number 16CRB00942 (as we previously discussed), but the trial court instructed the jury prior to opening statements (and in its jury instructions) that “[e]vidence does not include * * * closing arguments of counsel.” (May 21-24, 2019 Tr., Vol. IV at 1011); (Doc. No. 100). (See also May 21-24, 2019 Tr., Vol. I, at 159-160). “A jury is presumed to follow and comply with instructions given by the trial court.” State v. Palmer, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2013-12-243, 2014-Ohio-5491, ¶ 27, quoting State v. Carpenter, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2005-11-494, 2007-Ohio-5790, ¶ 20, citing Pang v. Minch, 53 Ohio St.3d 186 (1990). See also State v. Jones, 135 Ohio St.3d 10, 2012-Ohio-5677, ¶ 194. Furthermore, there is no evidence that the jury failed to follow the trial court’s jury instructions because the jury found Rasawehr not guilty of two of the charges that it was presented in this case and all of the charges that it was presented in case number 16CRB00942. Therefore, Rasawehr cannot demonstrate that he was prejudiced by the State’s closing argument. ",,prosecutorial misconduct,Zimmerman,William R. Zimmerman,Shaw and Preston,"Stephen R. Shaw,Vernon L.

As both the Ohio Supreme Court and this court have noted, “the actions of a prosecutor may combine with an evidentiary error to cause greater impact.” Morris, 141 Ohio St.3d 399, 2014-Ohio5052, 24 N.E.3d 1153, at ¶ 31; State v. Hall, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-170699, 2019-
Ohio-2985, ¶ 27. We are specifically concerned with the following remarks: 
[Jones] had no honest fear of [Neri]. * * * He is so scared of little Wayne
being around [Neri] and his guns, yet when you get the exhibits back in
the jury room take a look at Exhibit Number 22. Take a look at Exhibit
Number 22. Take a look at the shotgun that he just has laying out on the
wall. If he is a good dad—remind yourself, if he is a good dad, he doesn’t
want to have his kid around guns, be in danger, but the shotgun is laying out against the wall, the shells and the .38 rounds are on the—in the
bedroom on the mattress with the toys and the child’s sheets on it. But he
doesn’t want Wayne to be around [Neri], because he has got guns. It’s a
little contradictory. 

Based on these statements, there is no question that the state highlighted the improper evidence for the jury. There is also no question that the improper evidence prejudiced Jones. It is clear that the other-weapons photographs unfairly hampered Jones’s credibility. The photographs undermined Jones’s character by prejudicially portraying him as a violent person and a bad father, and ultimately, undermined Jones’s theory of defense. ",Did not reach anything/ reverses on other grounds,"{¶45} However, we need not answer whether this error alone was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because we examine this error in conjunction with the additional evidentiary errors discussed in the next section. “Although violations of the Rules of Evidence during trial, singularly, may not rise to the level of prejudicial error, a conviction will be reversed where the cumulative effect of the errors deprives a defendant of the constitutional right to a fair trial.” State v. DeMarco, 31 Ohio St.3d 191, 509 N.E.2d 1256 (1987), paragraph two of the syllabus. 

{¶79} We also agree with Jones’s ninth assignment of error that the cumulative effect of the evidentiary errors denied Jones a fair trial. The jury’s determination of guilt rested solely on whether it believed Jones. The exclusion of the state-of-mind evidence and the inclusion of prejudicial character evidence, which was emphasized by the state during closing argument, made Jones’s testimony and theory of the defense “far less persuasive.” We cannot be sure that these evidentiary errors did not tip the scale against Jones on the close and vital issue of his state of mind. Under these circumstances, we cannot say, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the cumulative effect of the errors was harmless. 

{¶81} In sum, we sustain Jones’s first, third, fourth, seventh, and ninth
assignments of error. Assignments of error two, five, six, and eight, which concern alleged errors that occurred during trial and at sentencing, are thereby rendered moot. Consequently, we reverse Jones’s aggravated-murder conviction under R.C. 2903.01(A), discharge Jones from further prosecution on that underlying count, and remand the cause for a new trial on the remaining murder counts under R.C. 2903.02(A) and 2903.02(B). Because Jones has failed to raise any assignments of error challenging his conviction for carrying a concealed weapon under R.C. 2923.12(A)(2), we affirm that
conviction. See App.R. 16(A); see also State v. Perez, 1st Dist. Hamilton Nos. C-040363, C-040364 and C-040365, 2005-Ohio-1326, ¶ 21-23. ",New trial,harmless error,Crouse,Candace C. Crouse,"ZAYAS, P.J., concurs.

Appellant also alleged that the prosecutor improperly sought to shift the burden of proof onto Appellant during closing arguments.
{¶86} During closing argument, the prosecutor made the following statements:
 ""Now Dr. Belloto told you this could be anything. This could be any
substance. This could be a number of substances. What substance did he
tell you this could be? Not one substance did he tell you. There's hundreds of thousands of substances in the database that he uses and Mr. Congleton uses and he didn't give you an example of one other substance using a mass spec run that this could possibly be besides cathinone. Not one substance did he say. He said it could be a million things, didn't name one.
Not one. Now just so we're clear, when Mr. Blake says they're going to tell
you you should have done this, should have done that. The Defendant
doesn't have a burden of proving anything and I don't expect him to prove
anything. I didn't expect him to bring Dr. Belloto in, but if he puts a witness on the stand, here's what we should expect as jurors and as officers of the court, when Dr. Belloto raises his right hand, he should have told the truth, that's what I expect from Dr. Belloto ....... I apologize if I misspoke. It's up to you to decide what, if anything, you believe of what Dr. Belloto said. What
I'm telling you is that Mr. Blake said the prosecutor is going to tell you you
should have tested the drug, I'm not going to say that What I'm going to tell you is he should have told the truth when he said he requested to test the - -"" T. at 696-697. 

{¶87} Additionally, the State prosecutor argued:
 But, finally, he told you under oath yesterday in court that he asked
to test the plant and was not allowed to do that. Mr. Hashi has a right to
have an independent analyst of his choice, including Dr. Belloto, to analyze those plants. They were preserved, they were frozen. … They were preserved, they were frozen. We could not have if we wanted to, and I didn't want to, nor did the judge, we could not have stopped him from doing that if he wanted to do that, and he told you he wanted to do that and was not allowed. You have to decide whether or not that's the truth or not. The State would suggest to you that that was not the truth."" T. at 698.

**

{¶89} Appellant also claims the State impermissibly attempted to shift the burden of proof by making the following statements during closing argument:
 The bottom line is when you go back there, if you deliberate and you
look at the science and you say, boy, I don't know, the science could go either way, just remember if you have any reasonable doubt, Mr. Hashi
didn't. Mr. Hashi knew it was khat. He identified it as khat. He chews it
because it has cathinone in it. Mr. Hashi knew exactly what he was doing
that day, he was trafficking in drugs and he was also possessing drugs for
a brief period of time, and under Ohio law, he's guilty of possession and
trafficking in 3,900 grams of cathinone contained in the plant khat. T. at 700. ",No error,"{¶88} Upon review of said statements, we find same to be reasonable comments on the evidence and permissible argument. We further find, upon reviewing the prosecutor's remark in the context of the entire trial, these comments did not prejudicially affected the substantial rights of appellant. State v. Brown, 5th Dist. Stark No. 2012CA00040, 2013–Ohio–2220, at ¶ 37, appeal not allowed, 136 Ohio St.3d 1512, 2013–Ohio–4657, 995 N.E.2d 1214, ¶¶ 34–38 (2013) and appeal not allowed, 137 Ohio St.3d 1462, 2013–Ohio–4657, ¶¶ 34–38 (2013).

{¶90} Upon review, we find Appellant’s arguments that this was an attempt to shift the burden of proof to be unpersuasive. Rather, we again find same to be fair and reasonable comment on the evidence.

advanced by the prosecutor: (1) expression of a personal opinion regarding witness credibility; (2) comments regarding appellant’s decision to remain silent; and (3) alleged appeals to God. He provides various quotes, taken from the state’s closing argument, but fails to advance arguments how the alleged errors are obvious, let alone clearly discuss how they affected his substantial rights. After setting forth the law relating to prosecutorial misconduct and citing cases which he presumably finds analogous, he simply draws the conclusions that: (1) a prosecutor can comment upon witness credibility, but may not express his or her opinion; (2) the prosecutor’s comments on appellant’s silence rendered the trial fundamentally unfair; and, (3) references to God, appealing to a “higher power,” are unwarranted and “just plainly improper.” As appellant fails to fully engage in the plain error analysis, his arguments lack merit. In the interest of justice, however, we shall address appellant’s points in turn. ",No error,"{¶50} During closing argument, the state is afforded wide latitude to convincingly advance its strongest arguments and positions. See State v. Phillips, 74 Ohio St.3d 72, 90 (1995); still, the prosecutor must avoid going beyond the evidence presented in order to obtain a conviction. See, e.g., State v. Smith, 14 Ohio St.3d 13, 14 (1984). “[P]rosecutors must be diligent in their efforts to stay within the boundaries of acceptable argument and must refrain from the desire to make outlandish remarks, misstate evidence, or confuse legal concepts.” State v. Fears, 86 Ohio St.3d 329, 332 (1999). While the prosecutor’s comment was somewhat hyperbolic, it was made in the context of reviewing what the state’s scientific evidence revealed and, albeit with some histrionics, essentially emphasized the logical maxim that possibility= does not equate with probability. We see no error in the remark. 

{¶58} In this case, appellant met willingly with police without invoking his right to counsel. Moreover, the prosecutor’s comments were not obviously directed at appellant’s pre-arrest silence. Indeed, appellant denied the allegations. Rather, the prosecutor’s points relate more to appellant’s demeanor and the arguable peculiarity of appellant’s reticence. We discern no obvious error in the content of the prosecutor’s remarks. 

{¶59} Finally, appellant cites to the prosecutor’s purported appeal to a “higher
power.” The prosecutor stated as follows: “And God bless Detective Johnson for doing what he does.” And “Thank God he thought about saving those clothes.” We fail to see how any reasonable person would conclude these statements are problematic. The use of the term “God” in these statements is idiomatic. They are interjections or commonly used expressions employed to express gratitude or relief. We perceive no error in the prosecutor’s statements. ",Resentencing,prosecutorial misconduct,Cynthia Westcott Rice,Cynthia Westcott Rice,"Mary Jane Trapp, Timothy P.

Chavez,Other,2019,Assault,Felonious assault,"possession of cocaine, one count of possession of heroin",,,Male,4 years,,2019,Examination of witnesses,"{¶53} On appeal, Chavez alleges three instances in which he contends that his right to remain silent was violated. First, Chavez argues that the State violated his constitutional rights when the State elicited testimony from Deputy Callahan stating that he “went to [Chavez’s] residence and ‘banged’ on the door, yelled “[Chavez] we know you’re in there, come on out, talk to us’, but there was no response” and that “someone from inside [Chavez’s] residence opened the blind a little, then closed and locked the door.” (Appellant’s Brief at 12, quoting Jan. 17, 2019 Tr., Vol. I, at 129, 138-147, 150-155, 159-162). Similarly, Chavez argues that the State improperly elicited testimony from Deputy Callahan that Chavez did not report to him anything about the incident—namely, that Poole “broke into” his residence, which resulted in him defending himself. (Appellant’s Brief at 13).",No error,"{¶54} Although introduced during the State’s case-in-chief, this evidence
does not violate Chavez’s right to remain silent. “[I]n limited circumstances, testimony of pre-arrest silence is appropriate if it is introduced as evidence of the ‘course of the investigation.’” State v. Pence, 12th Dist. Warren No. CA2012-05-045, 2013-Ohio-1388, ¶ 16, quoting Leach at ¶ 32. Here, when reviewed in context, the State was eliciting testimony from Deputy Callahan for purposes of describing the course of his investigation. Compare id. at ¶ 17 (concluding that law enforcement’s “testimony regarding his phone call to [Pence] and [Pence’s] failure to return the call may have been a ‘legitimate’ response to the state’s questions about the investigation”). See Graber, 2003-Ohio-137, at ¶ 130 (concluding that the law enforcement officer’s testimony that Graber did not want to speak with him at the time he was conducting its investigation did not amount to plain error). 

Therefore, because the evidence was not introduced as substantive evidence of Chavez’s guilt, Chavez’s right to remain silent is not implicated in these instances.
{¶55} Finally, Chavez contends that the State improperly asked him on
cross-examination why he did not report the incident to law enforcement. Chavez’s argument is specious. A defendant’s pre-arrest, pre-Miranda silence may be introduced for impeachment purposes. State v. Collins, 7th Dist. Columbiana No. 10 CO 10, 2011-Ohio-6365, ¶ 17. See Leach at ¶ 21, citing Jenkins v. Anderson, 447 U.S. 231, 238, 240, 100 S.Ct. 2124 (1980). “[U]se of pre-arrest silence as impeachment evidence is permitted because it furthers the truth-seeking process. Otherwise, a criminal defendant would be provided an opportunity to perjure himself at trial, and the state would be powerless to correct the record.” Leach at ¶33. Indeed, “‘impeachment follows the defendant’s own decision to cast aside his cloak of silence and advances the truth-finding function of the criminal trial.’” Id. at ¶ 22, quoting Jenkins at 238. Here, the State’s questions of Chavez on crossexamination amount to impeachment evidence, which does not violate Chavez’s right to remain silent. See id. at ¶ 21 (noting that “neither the Fifth Amendment right to be free from self-incrimination nor the Fourteenth Amendment right to due process is [sic] violated by the use of pre-arrest silence to impeach a criminal defendant’s credibility”), citing Jenkins at 238, 240.

He argues he was entitled to dismissal of the indictment because the mistrial was the result of intentional conduct by the prosecutor and the conduct was improper, even if the prosecutor was mistaken on whether the conduct was appropriate. 

In arguing the prosecutor’s conduct with a sworn witness was improper, Appellant says the defense was prejudiced by the mid-examination strategizing to contradict points made by defense counsel during cross-examination. He believes the situation was worsened by the inclusion of the doctor who had not yet testified (noting the felonious assault offense can be based on psychological harm). Appellant also states the purpose of a witness separation order is to ensure a witness will not collaborate with other witnesses. ",Did not reach error/conduct did not result in prejudice,"{¶20} Here, the trial court did not forbid communication with anyone during the break in the victim’s testimony or otherwise restrict the prosecutor’s access to the victim between cross-examination and redirect examination. Consequently, the victim’s contact with the prosecutor and her doctor during the break was not prohibited. See Henness, 79 Ohio St.3d at 60. See also State v. Boddie, 3d Dist. Allen No. 1-2000-72, 2001-Ohio2261 (finding no deprivation of the right to a fair trial where the prosecutor removed an exhibit from the courtroom and met with a witness to explain how the exhibit was organized during a recess while the witness’s cross-examination was suspended).

{¶21} Furthermore and regardless of the impropriety issue, there is no indication the prosecutor’s contact with the victim on the lunch break was “intentionally calculated to cause or invite a mistrial.” See Loza, 71 Ohio St.3d at 71, citing Kennedy, 456 U.S. at 678-679. This part of the test does not merely consider whether the complained of act was intentionally performed but asks whether the act of prosecutorial misconduct was intentionally calculated to trigger a mistrial. The trial court found on the record that the prosecutor’s conduct was not nefarious or malicious and the result was not intended; defense counsel agreed, noting he was not accusing the prosecutor. (Tr. 142, 148). The trial judge was in the best position to judge the prosecutor’s credibility. See Greene, 7th Dist. No. 02 CA 122 at ¶ 26-28. See also Kennedy, 456 U.S. at 675 (the trial court’s decision on whether the prosecutor had intent calculated to invite a mistrial is a factual one based on the circumstances and includes inference from objective facts). 

In any event, an independent review of the record discloses no indication the prosecutor spoke with the victim on the lunch break with an intent to “goad” the defendant into moving for a mistrial. As it cannot be said there was “intent on the part of the prosecutor to subvert the protections afforded by the Double Jeopardy Clause,” Appellant’s argument fails. See Kennedy, 456 U.S. at 675-676.

Cummings,Lavender,Andrew,Andrew Lavender,Black,2017,Murder,Aggravated murder,,,,"Male,Female",Life without parole,,2017,"Examination of witnesses,Summation,Discovery","There are several allegations: 

{¶86} In addition to the above, Lavender makes several additional
arguments relating to counsel’s failure to object to portions of the proceedings that he claims represent prosecutorial misconduct. In his first argument, Lavender claims that counsel should have objected to the state’s use of leading questions on direct examination. 

**

{¶90} While Lavender’s argument is somewhat difficult to follow, he seems to first argue that Police Officer Grant improperly testified as a “quasi expert witness” on eyewitness identification. Grant was the officer who conducted the photo array with Coulter. 

The state asked him what he thought when Coulter first expressed that one individual looked like the suspect, and then said that another was the person he saw. Lavender also claims that Grant improperly testified as an expert witness on the issues relating to pretrial motions to suppress eyewitness identifications and the rules relating to the disclosure of exculpatory evidence.

 He also claims that Grant improperly testified as an expert witness on how homicide investigations are properly undertaken. Lavender further claims that Detective Gehring testified as an expert witness on the question of how discovery works in a criminal prosecution, how people in a high-crime neighborhood behave and speak, the use of burner phones and trap houses, the workings and identification of firearms, the proper implementation of a photo array for identification, and the usefulness of a composite sketch. 

{¶113} In his brief, Lavender cites a series of other passages “for additional improper opinion testimony,” but presents no argument as to them. We have reviewed them all and find that none were expert opinions which would have triggered Crim.R. 16(K).


**

{¶116} Lavender first claims that the prosecutor improperly elicited hearsay testimony from the witness who created the composite sketch based on the description given by Coulter. Lavender claims that the Ohio Supreme Court has not addressed the issue. But it has. The court said:
A drawing of an alleged assailant sketched by a police artist, a poster
reproduction of that drawing, a ‘mug shot’ of the accused taken after
arrest, and the testimony of police officers as to statements describing
the accused made to them by a prosecuting witness, are admissible
solely to indicate the process by which the accused was identified, where that process is under attack, and to corroborate that identification.
State v. Lancaster, 25 Ohio St.2d 83, 267 N.E.2d 291 (1971), paragraph four of the syllabus. The testimony was admitted for the purpose of explaining how the image was produced. Therefore, trial counsel’s failure to object was not ineffective assistance. 

**

{¶126} Under this assignment of error, Lavender’s entire argument is that
“[t]his trial had numerous instances of prosecutorial misconduct. These are outlined in [the] first three assignments of error of this brief and incorporated by reference herein. The prosecutor’s improper comments in closing arguments and the introduction of inadmissible evidence prejudiced the defendant’s right to a fair trial.” For the reasons set forth above, we overrule Lavender’s fourth assignment of error.",No error,"{¶87} We have examined the three instances cited by Lavender in their
context. All three came from the questioning of a detective on areas of procedure about which trial counsel had presented evidence that the police work had been deficient. But these questions in no way coached the witness to give an answer that was untrue or that the witness would not have otherwise given. 

This was not a situation, like this court has addressed previously, where the prosecutor had “essentially testified for the state’s witnesses.” See State v. Lee, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-160294, 2017-Ohio-7377, ¶ 31. Trial counsel’s failure to object to these isolated questions was not ineffective. 

**

{¶88} Next, Lavender claims that counsel was ineffective for failing to object to a series of questions presented to law enforcement witnesses designed to demonstrate that they had followed proper procedure. Lavender now argues that the state was improperly “bolstering” its case and improperly shoring up the credibility of its witnesses. But Lavender cites no legal rule that this violates, and he has made no reference to any legal authority that stands for the proposition that the state is not permitted to do so. Trial counsel placed the quality of the police work at issue in this case, and the state was permitted to respond to that by eliciting testimony about the quality of the police work. Trial counsel understood that he had placed that at issue, and therefore, did not object when this evidence was presented. And he was not ineffective for failing to do so. 

**

{¶114} Having reviewed every instance cited by Lavender in which he claims that the state improperly offered expert opinion testimony, we find no instances where that was the case. We did hold that one section of testimony—relating to the role of a motion to suppress and its legal significance—was not relevant. But we further hold that counsel was not ineffective for failing to object because the issue was one the jury could determine on its own. And, nonetheless, the testimony was not improper because it was not expert opinion testimony.

Separately, Judge Bergeron dissented and found that the state's admission of Exhibit 16(A) constitutes reversible error.

used by the state during the course of the trial. The state said that Rosemond had “shot up people,” talked about how the victims had been “gunned down,” and how the deceased had been “executed.” Rosemond said that the state used “dog-whistling language” because the prosecutor said that the people involved “don’t speak the King’s English,” instead of saying that they used slang. 

The prosecutor also told the prospective jury during voir dire that they may see people involved in the shooting in the public gallery. At one point, the state referred to “bad actors, the thugs like this defendant.” The trial court instructed the jury to disregard that comment. 

Additionally, Rosemond claims that the state’s repeated references to the area as a “high-crime volume area” were improperly used to buttress the state’s claims that witnesses were afraid to testify, and that Rosemond was guilty by association because he lived in such a neighborhood. During closing argument, the state referred to Rosemond as “not the smartest guy to ever walk the earth” and as “not a rocket scientist.”


{¶42} In his fourth assignment of error, Rosemond claims that the trial
court abused its discretion when it allowed Cincinnati Police Criminalist David Landesberg to testify regarding the reconstruction of the bullet trajectory of the rounds fired during the December 8 shooting because the state failed to comply with Crim.R. 16(K). ",Harmless error,"DISCOVERY -HARMLESS
{¶51} Having determined that Landesberg provided expert testimony, we
further conclude that the state failed to provide an expert “report.” According to Crim.R. 16(K), the expert must provide a “written report summarizing the expert witness’s testimony, findings, analysis, conclusions, or opinion, and shall include a summary of the expert’s qualifications.” The only thing the state provided to the defense was a diagram of the trajectories and no summary of the expert’s qualifications. This is insufficient to satisfy the requirement, and the state does not
argue otherwise on appeal. 

{¶54} Having reviewed the improper testimony of Landesberg, in light of
the record as a whole, we conclude that Rosemond was not prejudiced by the testimony, and that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt


REMARKS-  NO ERROR
{¶73} This court has reviewed the entirety of the record in this case,
including the transcript of what was a lengthy, and at times contentious trial. Having considered the cited conduct in the context of the entire proceedings, we cannot say that Rosemond did not receive a fair trial because of the comments made by the prosecutor. The state’s theory of the case was that the victim was executed for having testified in another murder trial. This execution was an example of the fear many felt in the community about testifying at trial. These factors were part of the state’s theory of the case, and the fact that it was described “colorfully” does not mean that the trial was unfair. We overrule Rosemond’s sixth assignment of error.

Brandt,Ruggles,Eric,Eric Ruggles,White,2019,Sexual violence,Rape,"Gross sexual imposition, sexual battery",,checked,Female,20 to life,,2019,Jury selection,"In his second assignment of error, appellant argues that the prosecutor made improper statements during jury selection and thereby deprived him of a fair trial.

Appellant identifies three different statements regarding the prosecutor's personal professional experience in sexual offense cases, his description of post-traumatic stress disorder, and his explanation of the ""one witness rule""—that the testimony of one witness, if believed, is sufficient basis to prove a fact of consequence—to argue that the prosecution both
misstated the burden of proof and presented the venire with expert opinion evidence not adduced at trial. 

{¶49} During jury selection, the prosecutor told the venire:
Now, my experience, you know, professional experience in this
area when I give discussions, when I go out to the community
to talk about sexual abuse with the community is that most
people have that discussion about stranger danger, right? They
have that discussion of, you know, if there's some creepy guy in
a van offering you candy, you know, run back to the house and
tell me, right?
I can tell you in 20 years doing this, I've never had the creepy
guy in the van. Almost all of my cases involve a person that the
child knows, right? And that's the reality of sexual abuse. It's
either a family member or a close person to the family, right? ",Harmless error,"this statement necessarily introduced the prosecutor's own experiences
and essentially vouched for, albeit unintentionally, the charges against appellant. Voir dire should be a neutral search for juror bias and prejudicial preconceived beliefs. This statement was an improper method of determining whether prospective jurors held any preconceived beliefs or bias because it vouched for the prosecution's theory of the case.

Nevertheless, after a review of the record, this statement did not so infect the proceeding as to deprive appellant of a fair trial. Nothing in the statement actually accused appellant or showed the prosecutor's personal belief of appellant's guilt. Moreover, this was an isolated comment and ""[i]solated comments by a prosecutor are not to be taken out of context and given their most damaging meaning."" State v. Cotton, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2003-06-159, 2004-Ohio-4409, ¶ 17. In the context of the entire trial, the jury heard the
testimony of both victims and was properly instructed on the law applicable to the case, i.e. that statements by the attorneys were not to be considered as evidence, the burden of proof required to convict appellant, and how to evaluate witness credibility. Ultimately, appellant has not demonstrated that this remark so infected the proceeding that it undermined the fairness of the proceeding. 
This is evident by the jury acquitting appellant on several of the
sexual offense charges. Moreover, there was substantial evidence against appellant to establish the elements of the offenses beyond a reasonable doubt when viewed in the absence of this statement. Therefore, this statement did not prejudice appellant and did not affect appellant's substantial rights.",,prosecutorial misconduct,Hendrickson,Robert A.

The state did not cross-examine Rowland. Instead, the state called
Detective Behymer as a rebuttal witness. During his testimony, Detective Behymer indicated that after Rowland's arrest, he and another detective interviewed Rowland and that Rowland would not answer when the detectives asked if A.R. was lying. Defense counsel did not object to the questioning",Did not reach error/conduct did not result in prejudice,"We conclude that Detective Behymer's statement concerning Rowland's
refusal to answer his question does not rise to the level of plain error

Due to Rowland's statements during the controlled call, we find he cannot
show he was prejudiced by Detective Behymer's testimony. That is, we find the outcome of the trial would not have been different had Detective Behymer not commented on Rowland's refusal to answer whether A.R. was a liar, as he made incriminating statements during the call with A.R., and did not accuse A.R. of lying.

{¶ 46} We similarly reject Rowland's argument that Detective Behymer's testimony regarding Rowland's post-arrest silence violated Doyle v. Ohio, 426 U.S. 610 (1976).

According to Mr. Penn, the hypothetical was improper because it directly paralleled the facts herein and invited the venire to form an opinion about the case in advance of trial. 

The foregoing hypothetical drew an objection from Mr. Penn, as he believed the prosecutor had gone “too much into the specific facts of this case *

{¶39} Mr. Penn moved for a new trial based on the admission of Inspector D’Avello’s testimony. He argued that the trial court should not have allowed the inspector to offer expert opinion testimony without being qualified to testify as an expert. On appeal, he maintains that the
State did not lay a proper foundation for the investigator to testify as an expert. Further, he maintains that the State never provided him with an expert report, pursuant to Crim.R. 16(K), to put him on notice that the investigator would be testifying as an expert. Because an irregularity in
the proceedings or an error of law occurred, Mr. Penn argues, the trial court erred when it denied his motion for a new trial. ",Harmless error,"The record supports the conclusion that the prosecutor posed her hypotheticals to the jury as a means of explaining various legal concepts (i.e., beyond a reasonable doubt and circumstantial evidence). Moreover, the trial court specifically instructed the jury not “to place any significance upon the questions asked [during voir dire] as to how they may pertain to the trial.” 

Because Mr. Penn has not shown that the trial court abused its discretion when it overruled his objection to the prosecutor’s voir dire, his sixth assignment of error is overruled.

Specifically, Smith points to the State’s opening that termed the facts of Smith’s case “a parent’s worst nightmare” and called Smith a “master manipulator” and “perpetrator” who “needs to be held accountable” for “stealing [C.B.’s] innocence;” and to the State’s repeating some of the same verbiage during closing. (See Tr., pp. 94, 100; pp. 423, 424, 425.) Smith also challenges the prosecutor’s closing remarks that dismissed as “ludicrous” defense counsel’s suggestion that C.B. exaggerated the extent of Smith’s actions in response to pressure from her parents, and opined that Smith needed “a wake-up call.” (Id., pp. 425, 434.)12",No error,"{¶ 51} Smith did not object at trial to any of the conduct that forms the basis for this assignment of error. As we find the specific remarks identified by Smith to have been neither unduly inflammatory nor prejudicial, Smith has failed to establish the existence of error, plain or otherwise. 

{¶ 53} A similar conclusion follows as to the prosecutor’s references to defense counsel’s argument as “ludicrous” and to Smith as needing “a wake-up call.” Although “personal attacks and accusations against defense counsel” may amount to prosecutorial misconduct, attacking the plausibility of defense counsel’s argument rather than attacking defense counsel personally falls within “the normal latitude allowed in closing arguments.” See Maurer, 15 Ohio St.3d at 267, 473 N.E.2d 768. Further, in arguing that Smith needed “a wake-up call,” the prosecutor was echoing Smith’s own statement, in his text message  apology to C.B.’s parents, that their discovery of his relationship with C.B. had been “the biggest wake-up call in my life.” (See Tr., p. 124, and State’s Exh. 4A.) By merely observing that Smith apparently had not experienced a “wake-up call” despite the second chance extended by C.B.’s parents, the prosecutor did not act improperly, and Smith was not prejudiced by the trial court’s having heard the prosecutor’s remarks.

It is well-established that a conviction obtained through the use of false evidence violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Napue v. People of State of Illinois, 360 U.S. 264, 269, 79 S.Ct. 1173, 3
L.Ed.2d 1217 (1959).
The principal prosecution witness at Napue’s murder trial was an
accomplice then serving a sentence for the crime. He testified, in
response to an inquiry by the prosecutor, that he had received
no promise of consideration in return for his testimony. In fact, the
prosecutor had promised him consideration, but he did nothing to correct
the witness’ false testimony. This Court held that the failure of the
prosecutor to correct the testimony, which he knew to be false, denied
Napue due process of law, and that this was so even though
the false testimony went only to the credibility of the witness. 

{¶56} Smith argues that the state solicited false testimony from Detective Coombs, and then emphasized Coombs’s false testimony in its closing argument.",No error,"Therefore, there was no prosecutorial misconduct for soliciting the

{¶22} In his first and second assignments of error, Mr. Quinn argues that the trial court erred in playing the cell phone video of S.L. getting dressed in her bedroom and then admitting the video into evidence. 

---------------

{¶29} In his third assignment of error, Mr. Quinn argues that he was deprived of a fair trial due to prosecutorial misconduct when the prosecutor made various statements: “1) discussing two different irrelevant alleged prior bad acts, 2) improperly bolstering the credibility of the complaining witness, 3) introducing facts not in evidence through questions, and 4) repeatedly referring to [S.L.’s] boyfriend (“C.R.”) as “Brandon,” thereby confusing him with [Mr.] Quinn.” We disagree. 

{¶31} Mr. Quinn first alleges misconduct occurred when the prosecutor discussed “two different irrelevant alleged prior bad acts[.]” The first was the cell phone video recording of S.L. in her bedroom, which he claims was both irrelevant to the charged offenses and unfairly prejudicial. 

-----We have already addressed the cell phone incident above, determined that the playing of the video and its introduction into evidence was harmless, and likewise decline to engage in any further analysis of it. ----

-------

{¶32} He next challenges the prosecutor’s remarks during opening statements concerning Mr. Quinn’s prior, alleged rape of S.L. during an incident in Hocking Hills as highly prejudicial. It is axiomatic that remarks made by counsel in opening statements are not evidence. 

¶34} Mr. Quinn argues that these comments “unfairly aroused a feeling of antipathy against [him] in the jury[,]” and although testimony regarding the incident was later deemed inadmissible by the trial court, “[t]he bell could not be ‘un-rung’ * * *.” He further speculates that the prosecutor made these remarks in bad faith by claiming “the prosecutor had every reason to know that evidence regarding this incident would not be admissible[,]” yet he offers no explanation or support for this conclusory statement. Although the trial court did, in fact, later determine that any evidence of the Hocking Hills incident was inadmissible, this eventuality was not made apparent until during S.L.’s testimony, well after opening statements had concluded. We therefore conclude that the prosecutor’s reference to S.L.’s expected testimony regarding the Hocking Hills incident was not made in bad faith and, consequently,
cannot be the basis for a prosecutorial misconduct claim

-----------
{¶35} Mr. Quinn also objected at trial to the following statements made by the prosecutor during his cross-examination of S.L.’s mother (“B.Q.”):
(1) “Yes, because of the events that were going on. She was being molested by your boyfriend, and then she gets recorded and mom doesn’t believe her. Are those the events you’re talking about that led to her leaving the house at seventeen years old?”
(2) “Well, maybe. Give me an example, because apparently, it’s not molesting your daughter.”
(Emphasis added.).",Did not reach error/conduct did not result in prejudice,"{¶23} At the outset, we are compelled to note that although Mr. Quinn assigns as error the prosecutor’s failure to provide the cell phone video in discovery, he makes no actual argument in support of that claim. See App.R. 16(A)(7). He only mentions the State’s failure to provide discovery briefly in the statement of facts portion of his merit brief, which does not satisfy his duty to present an argument with respect to each assignment of error under App.R. 16(A)(7). We decline to assume Mr. Quinn’s duty on appeal and create an argument on his behalf as to discovery of the video. See In re E.G., 9th Dist. Medina No. 16CA0075-M, 2017- Ohio-2584, ¶ 27 

Nevertheless, the same attorney represented Mr. Quinn in both his voyeurism and GSI cases, and the prosecutor stated at trial that the video had been previously provided to defense counsel in the voyeurism case. In objecting to the video, defense counsel stated, “This is not the version of this tape that I have previously seen.” Thus, even if Mr. Quinn had set forth an argument challenging the State’s failure to provide discovery of the video, defense counsel essentially admitted to receiving a copy of the video in advance, previously viewing it, and specifically recalling its contents, and we would likewise determine that Mr. Quinn has not suffered any prejudice. 
---------------


{¶26} As noted above Mr. Quinn is only challenging the trial court’s decision to allow the playing of the cell phone video and the admission of the video into evidence. On appeal, he has not challenged any of the trial testimony related to the video, which was undeniably extensive. 

S.L. testified about finding the cell phone in record mode in her room, about what she was doing immediately before finding the phone, and about the aftermath of finding the phone recording her. In fact, almost all of the witnesses testified in some way about the video. In addition, S.L. read from the statement she provided to police about finding the cell phone and that statement was admitted into evidence as a defense exhibit. Even without seeing the contents of the video, given the evidence before it, it seems difficult to fathom that the jury would have questioned or doubted that a video as described by the witnesses existed. 

Thus, even assuming without deciding that the video should not have been played for the jury or admitted at trial because it represented improper other acts evidence, this Court concludes, after considering the totality of the record, that any error in playing or admitting it was harmless. See Crim.R. 52(A) (stating “[a]ny error, defect, irregularity, or variance which does not affect substantial rights shall be disregarded”). 

--------

{¶37} In the remainder of this assignment of error, Mr. Quinn challenges a multitude of other statements made by the prosecutor throughout the trial, and argues that the prosecutor committed misconduct by: (1) improperly bolstering S.L.’s credibility during direct examination; (2) presenting “facts” to the jury under the guise of questioning a witness; and (3) improperly confusing S.L.’s boyfriend (“C.R.”) with Mr. Quinn during his opening statement. 
We need not address the merits of these arguments, however, because Mr. Quinn never objected to any of these other statements at trial and has, thus, forfeited all but plain error on appeal.  Mr. Quinn has not raised plain error on appeal, and “[t]his Court has repeatedly noted that it will not sua sponte fashion an unraised plain error argument and then address it.” State v. Thomas, 9th Dist. Summit No. 27580, 2015-Ohio-5247, {¶38} Mr. Quinn’s third assignment of error is overruled. ",,prosecutorial misconduct,Carr,Donna J. Carr,"Hensal, Teodosio","Thomas A.

The court then declines to make an argument and focuses on whether the trial court erred in playing the cell phone video — this is the error that they find harmless. 

DISSENT: Judge Teodosio dissented stating that the improper admission of evidence is not harmless and that it was highly prejudicial. He said that he would revers and remand for a new trial.

Berry, an African-American, objected to these peremptory challenges on Batson grounds.

 In response to the peremptory challenge as to Lawson, Berry's counsel stated:
""[P]ursuant to Batson, we would ask the prosecutor to show cause beyond Mr. Lawson's race. He's the only male black juror that just got excused."" (Voire Dire Vol. II at 68.) The
trial court indicated that it did not ""see a Batson problem existing at this point in time,"" but it did give the parties an opportunity to argue and develop the issue. (Voire Dire Vol. II at 69.) The state indicated that it removed Lawson because of his voir dire answers in this case and his voir dire answers in another case as relayed by that case's prosecutor. After hearing the state's explanation, the trial court stated: ""I'm just making a record * * * I don't see a problem at this point in time. They are making their objection. They are making their record and we'll see where it goes. You know, it's not like we don't have - - there is a shortage of jurors in there, though. And just because he picked one doesn't necessarily mean that we have the issue. Okay?"" (Voire Dire Vol. II at 71.) Thus, the trial court overruled the Batson challenge to Lawson's removal. ",No error,"{¶ 18} We construe the transcript of the voir dire proceedings to indicate the trial court's determination that Berry failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination as to the removal of potential juror Lawson and alternate juror Scott. That is, even though the trial court permitted the state to provide an explanation for its dismissal of Lawson, it found no inference of purposeful discrimination and thus denied Berry's Batson objections on the preliminary issue of whether he had made a prima facie showing. 

We agree the record does not support an inference of purposeful discrimination by the state in its peremptory challenges to Lawson and Scott. The record is clear that Lawson is a male AfricanAmerican. And while Scott's race was not expressly stated in the record, the record strongly suggests she is also African-American. However, the showing that Lawson and Scott are both African-Americans is not, by itself, sufficient to meet the prime facie requirement. In objecting to the peremptory challenges at trial, Berry's only reason given was that Lawson
was ""the only male black juror that just got excused."" (Voire Dire Vol. II at 68.) 
But that reason did not address the presence of African-American females, and there is no indication in the record as to whether these individuals were the only two African-Americans in the venire. Thus, we conclude the trial court did not err in finding no inference of purposeful racial discrimination. Consequently, Berry's arguments challenging the state's explanation are moot.",,Batson v.

right to a fair trial due to cumulative prosecutorial misconduct. Specifically, he alleges that the prosecutor deliberately elicited improper testimony on his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent, made improper statements in opening remarks, made prejudicial references to the codefendant, and misstated the evidence in the closing argument.

Examination of witnesses:
{¶23} After Savage’s arrest, he invoked his right to counsel and refused to
answer any questions. At trial, the prosecutor had the following exchange with Detective David Hall:
Q: Did you ever ask Mr. Savage if that was in fact his phone?
A: That was one of the things we discussed with him during the interview, but he declined to comment.
- 
{¶27} Next, Savage contends the prosecutor attempted to present improper inferences when Savage’s alleged accomplice, Anthony Brooks, refused to testify. When Brooks was called to testify, the prosecutor asked him where he was on the date of the Boost Mobile robbery. In response, Brooks refused to testify, relying on his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Once he stated that he would not testify, no further questions were asked, and the witness was released.

Opening/Closing arguments:
{¶29} Finally, Savage claims that the prosecutor misstated the evidence in opening and closing by telling the jurors that Boost packaging was found in the truck that Savage rented. However, the state submitted two photographs into evidence that showed Boost packaging in the truck. Thus, the prosecutor’s remarks were accurate representations of the evidence.",Did not reach error/conduct did not result in prejudice,"Examination of witnesses: 
{¶25} Here, the state presented testimony that Savage remained silent rather than answer the detective’s question. Assuming that the question was improper, Savage does not explain how the testimony was prejudicial and deprived him of a fair trial, and we conclude that Savage was not denied his right to a fair trial.
{¶26} First, the reference was brief and isolated. See Leach. Second, the trial court immediately sustained the objection, gave a curative instruction, and further instructed the jurors to disregard the question and the answer. Finally, the trial court provided a second curative instruction in its general instructions. We must presume that the jury followed the curative instructions given by the trial judge.
-
{¶28} Once a witness exercises his Fifth Amendment right not to testify, the prosecutor is not permitted to continue questioning the witness in an attempt to introduce innuendo or inferences to the jury. See State v. Dinsio, 176 Ohio St. 460, 466, 200 N.E.2d 467 (1964). Dinsio is not violated where, as here, the prosecutor immediately ceased questioning Brooks when he invoked his right.

Opening/Closing Arguments:

Jones,Black,2018,Murder,Murder,,,,Male,15 to life,,2018,"Brady violation,Discovery","In his first assignment of error, Jones claims that his right to due
process and a fair trial were violated when the state failed to disclose and investigate material impeachment evidence, when the state engaged in misconduct, and when the trial court failed to declare a mistrial after it learned that the state had failed to disclose and investigate material impeachment evidence.

Jones’s first argument is that the state violated his right to a fair trial
when it withheld and failed to disclose promises made to T.D. to pay his library fines, get him an Xbox, and get T.D., Sr., out of jail. Because the state did not disclose this evidence, Jones argues that a new trial is warranted.
---

Next, Jones argues that the state committed prosecutorial misconduct
when it failed to disclose and investigate the alleged promises made to T.D.

Crim.R. 16(B)(5) codifies the prosecution’s duty to disclose “any
evidence favorable to the defendant and material to guilt or punishment,” i.e., Brady material.
",Harmless error,"in United States v. Agurs, 427 U.S. 97, 103, 96 S.Ct. 2392,
49 L.Ed.2d 342 (1976), the Supreme Court clarified that the Brady rule only applies in situations involving the discovery of exculpatory information after trial. (Emphasis added.)

Here, even if promises were made to T.D. or T.D., Sr., and not
disclosed prior to trial, the rule in Giglio does not apply because the promises allegedly made were discovered during trial and Jones had the ability to recall T.D., or call Rumsey or another witness, and get the impeachment material into evidence.

---


Nevertheless, the state’s failure to provide discovery is not reversible
error unless the “prosecution’s failure to disclose was a willful violation of Crim.R. 16, that foreknowledge of the [evidence] would have benefited the accused in the preparation of his defense, or that the accused was prejudiced.” Johnson at 592.

For purposes of determining if the prosecution committed a Crim.R.
16 violation, we impute the knowledge held by Detective Hilbert and the rest of the police/prosecution team onto the prosecution. This would include any promises to help with the library fines, provide an Xbox, to make T.D., Sr., available for trial, or to get T.D., Sr., a more lenient sentence. Once prosecutors knew of the detectives’ plans to visit T.D., Sr., they had a duty to follow-up after the visit and find out if any promises were made and disclose those promises. There is no indication that they did so.

 Upon a finding of a discovery violation under Crim.R. 16, the court is
required to impose the “least severe sanction that is consistent with the purpose of the rules of discovery.” State v. Parker, 53 Ohio St.3d 82, 86, 558 N.E.2d 1164 (1990).

Once again, Wickline is instructive. During trial, Wickline became
aware of police records that were not turned over by the prosecution in discovery regarding a police-officer-witness who had already testified. Wickline, 50 Ohio St.3d at 116, 552 N.E.2d 913. On appeal, Wickline claimed a discovery violation under Crim.R. 16(E). Id. at 117. But, Wickline had the option during trial to recall the officer-witness and cross-examine him on the records, but declined to do so. Id. The Ohio Supreme Court determined that since there were means available to Wicklin which were less drastic than ordering a new trial, and he decided to forego those means, he was not entitled to a new trial even if there had been a Crim.R. 16 violation. Id.

Similarly, Jones had remedies at his disposal less drastic than a new
trial. The court offered to allow Jones’s counsel to recall T.D., and counsel could have requested to voir dire T.D., Rumsey, or any other witness who may have possessed exculpatory information, but he declined to do so. Jones forewent these remedies, and has not shown prejudice as a result of the prosecution’s failure to further investigate any alleged promises made to T.D.

Toda claims that he was denied a fair trial when the prosecutor made
reference to Officer Petro observing blood splatter on “the defendant’s clothing.


---other/unknown (pre trial)
In his first assignment of error, Toda claims that the state pursued an RVO
specification, via a new indictment, as “punishment” for refusing to accept a plea in the original case and instead exercising his right to a jury trial....Toda has forfeited all but plain error because he did not raise the issue of prosecutorial vindictiveness in the trial court.",Did not reach error/conduct did not result in prejudice,"'---No prejudice, did not reach error---
The state insists that the prosecutor inadvertently asked about blood on “the
defendant’s clothing,” when she intended to refer to “the victim’s clothing.” It maintains that the jury likely recognized the error because Officer Petro had already acknowledged that he never saw Toda that night. Whether or not that occurred, we find that the prosecutor’s statement did not prejudice the outcome of the trial, because, at the time the question was posed, it had already been established - through L.W. - that K.W. and Toda had been “in close proximity” to one another at the time K.W. was injured. More
importantly, the jury also heard more damaging, direct evidence of Toda’s guilt, including K.W.’s statements that her “teeth [were] knocked in” by her “boyfriend” who hit her with his “fist,” that she had been “assaulted” in an act of “[d]omestic [v]iolence,” and that Toda had “definitely fucked [her up].” Therefore, we find that the alleged act of prosecutorial misconduct here did not substantially affect the outcome of the case.Toda’s second assignment of error is found not well-taken.


---No error + No prejudice---
Toda has failed to establish a case of vindictive prosecution....Finally, even if such evidence did exist, we would still find no plain error because, while the trial court did have the discretion to impose an additional sentence as to the RVO specification, it chose not to do so. See R.C. 2929.14(B)(2)(a). Therefore,
Toda cannot show any prejudicial effect with respect to the refiled indictment. For these reasons, Toda’s first assignment of error is not well-taken.",,,Osowik,Thomas J.

Reed claims that he was prevented from discovering the documents due to misconduct by the State, specifically statements by the prosecutor at his trial denying the existence of plea agreements and an alternative suspect. Reed also claims that the State knowingly offered false testimony from witnesses.",No error,"{¶ 38} Upon review of the alleged newly discovered exhibits and the trial transcript, we find no support for Reed’s assertion that the State withheld exculpatory evidence or that Reed was otherwise unavoidably prevented from discovering the evidence upon which he relies.

{¶ 39} In addition, upon review of Reed’s affidavit and supporting exhibits, we find no basis to conclude that the alleged newly discovered evidence warranted a new trial. None of the exhibits demonstrate that Shoemaker or Young (the two Miami County co-defendants who testified at the murder trial) received a benefit in exchange for their cooperation in Reed’s Montgomery County case (as opposed to the Miami County cases).
Many of Reed’s attached exhibits have no bearing on Reed’s guilt or innocence, nor do they have any apparent relevance to the impeachment of any witness or potential witness. And while some documents reflect that Dayton police officers collaborated to some extent with Miami County officers and that Patron Steele was believed, at some point, to be a possible suspect in the murder, the documents do not support a conclusion that officers or prosecutors withheld exculpatory information from Reed or that Steele might be culpable for the murder.

",Did not reach error/conduct did not result in prejudice,"{¶ 48} In response to appellant's argument, the state points to the recording of N.A.'s interview which was played at trial and admitted into evidence. In the interview, N.A. stated appellant exited the shower wearing only a towel, which he removed in her presence. After he removed the towel, appellant attempted to insert his penis into N.A.'s vagina. After failing to insert his penis, appellant rubbed it on N.A.'s vagina. Thus, the record reflects the state accurately summarized the evidence presented in the recorded interview. As a result, appellant has failed to demonstrate prosecutorial misconduct.
{¶ 49} Finally, appellant asserts the state committed misconduct because of inconsistencies between the state's summary of the evidence at trial and the three bills of particulars filed prior to trial. However, because the bills of particulars were not admitted as evidence or considered by the jury, it is unclear how any discrepancies between the bills of particulars and the assistant prosecutor's statements at trial deprived appellant of a fair trial. Furthermore, appellant cites no case law or other authority to support his contention.
Therefore, we conclude appellant has failed to demonstrate any error with regard to inconsistencies between the bills of particulars and the assistant prosecutor's statements at trial resulted in a reasonable probability of prejudice.

{¶47} Pettus additionally argues that the prosecutor committed misconduct by asking improper leading questions of its own witnesses. But Pettus fails to cite a single example in the record of where such an allegedly improper question was asked.",No error,"{¶46} Contrary to Pettus’s argument, Minelli never testified that Pettus had been on transitional control or that he had prior felony convictions. She explained that she was Pettus’s case manager while he resided at the Talbert House, and her testimony focused on explaining when Pettus had been given permission to leave the Talbert House and what reason he had provided for doing so. This testimony was used to establish Pettus’s identity as the perpetrator of the offenses, and not for the purpose that the trial court had previously prohibited.

Campbell sought relief on the grounds of actual innocence, ineffective assistance of counsel, and prosecutorial misconduct in failing to disclose favorable Brady evidence in discovery. All of these claims revolve around certain new evidence that Mr. Campbell obtained, including autopsy photos, date-and-time-stamped crash-scene photos, and original digital images of photos that had been admitted at trial (all of which came to light during federal habeas discovery), as well as the 2015 depositions of trial and appellate counsel and the 2015 report of accident-reconstruction expert Jack Holland. To support his postconviction claims, Mr. Campbell provided a litany of examples where this “new evidence,” if available at trial, would have combatted the state’s theory that Mr. Campbell was the driver, impeached critical witnesses, discredited the state’s expert, and shone a spotlight on potential mishandling of evidence by law enforcement. ",Harmful error,"{¶32} The state does not appear to dispute that it did not provide the
evidence that Mr. Campbell now claims was wrongfully withheld during the initial trial proceedings. And our review of the record convinces us of Mr. Campbell’s diligence in pursuing this evidence. The state only relinquished this evidence during the course of discovery in federal court, after the federal court ordered discovery.
Armed with that new evidence, Mr. Campbell then retained Mr. Holland to submit an expert report that accounts for both the prior and newly-discovered evidence. He then submitted Mr. Holland’s 2015 report and his counsel’s 2015 depositions in support of his habeas petition, only to be told that he needed to return to state court for exhaustion purposes. Mr. Campbell filed his present state proceedings with appropriate diligence after being prompted by the federal court.
{¶33} The record demonstrates that the state’s violation of its duty to
disclose material evidence effectively precluded Mr. Campbell from gaining access to that evidence, and thus learning of the proposed grounds for a new trial, until the evidence surfaced in habeas discovery and expert analysis revealed its significance.
Thus, his motion for leave demonstrates that the evidence upon which his new-trial motion depends could not have been discovered within the time prescribed by Crim.R. 33. We, therefore, hold that the trial court erred in denying him leave to move for a new trial based on that evidence.",,Brady v. Maryland,Bergeron,Pierre H.

",Harmful error,"{¶ 38} Having applied the six Branch factors to the case sub judice, we find the record demonstrates that the prosecutor’s race-neutral reasons for striking juror No. 5,
namely age and lack of education, were merely pretexts used by the state to justify its otherwise discriminatory peremptory challenge of juror No. 5. If age and education were important considerations for the prosecutor here, it stands to reason that he would have conducted some inquiry into those issues, particularly with juror No. 5. In State v.
Manns, 169 Ohio App.3d 687, 2006-Ohio-5802, 864 N.E.2d 657 (2d Dist.), the Second District conducted a Batson analysis and emphasized that “[t]he State of Ohio must be scrupulous in building a record which legitimately demonstrates their articulated
concern” regarding a stricken juror. Id. at ¶ 50. No such record was made in this case.  {¶ 40} Similar to the prosecutor in Singfield, the prosecutor here not only failed to conduct an inquiry into juror No. 5’s age and education, he also failed to provide any explanation as to how age and education were even relevant to the jury selection process in this case. On these facts, we find that the trial court clearly erred when it found that appellant did not meet his burden in proving a Batson violation. ",New trial,Batson v. Kentucky,"Gene A. Zmuda, J.

At the prosecutor’s request, R.I. briefly placed the prosecutor’s hands on her neck to demonstrate the manner in which Thomas held her neck. [...] In arguing that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to this evidence, Thomas contends that the demonstration was highly inflammatory and prejudicial, without any reasoning offered in support of this conclusion. 

**

{¶ 46} Next, Thomas fails to identify any prejudice resulting from the improper questions posed during the cross-examination of Alex Zilba. At trial, Zilba testified that he drove Thomas to R.I.’s house, spent the night sleeping on the living room floor, and heard nothing all night. On cross-examination, the prosecutor inquired into Zilba’s misdemeanor license suspension out of Toledo Municipal Court, and his court date the day before the incident. 
{¶ 47} The state argues that Zilba placed the conviction at issue by testifying that he drove Thomas. However, the prosecutor was not seeking to discredit Zilba’s claim
that he drove Thomas. Instead, the fact that Zilba drove Thomas to R.I.’s home was never in dispute, and it was Zilba’s loud engine that R.I. described in her testimony. The
mere fact that Zilba testified he drove Thomas did not make his prior conviction for driving without a valid license relevant to the matters on trial, and even if the parties
disputed whether Zilba drove that night, prior convictions were inadmissible to attack Zilba’s credibility on this subject. See, e.g., State v. Perry, 6th Dist. Ottawa No. OT-91-004, 1991 Ohio App. LEXIS 5912 (Dec. 13, 1991) (where issue on trial was whether Perry was driving the night of the incident, evidence of previous arrests for driving without a license was irrelevant and, pursuant to Evid.R. 609(A), inadmissible). ",Harmless error,"{¶ 48} “Pursuant to Evid.R. 609(A), prior convictions that are either felonies or those offenses involving dishonesty or false statement are admissible into evidence for the purpose of attacking the credibility of [a witness].” State v. Carpenter, 6th Dist. Erie No. E-00-033, 2002-Ohio-2266, ¶ 57. Thus, the prosecutor improperly questioned Zilba regarding his prior misdemeanor conviction, as driving without a license is neither a felony nor an offense involving dishonesty or a false statement. However, while trial counsel failed to object to this line of questioning, Thomas fails to identify any prejudicial error. While admission of such testimony was contrary to Evid.R. 609(A), such error was merely harmless error, as Zilba’s prior misdemeanor conviction could not have contributed to Thomas’s conviction.

Suells further argues that this same detective improperly testified as to his opinion that “Suells’s rendition of events was so close to that of the victim, with the exception of the issue of consent, it was almost as if he had used a cheat sheet, and that it was not credible for that reason.” Finally, Suells argues it was improper for the prosecutor to ask a witness “whether the witness wanted to come to court.” Suells concedes that, at trial, he did not object to the testimony which he is now challenging on appeal.",Did not reach error/conduct did not result in prejudice,"Given the presumption that the court did not consider the allegedly improper

Graffius,White,2018,Sexual violence,Rape,,,,Female,8 years,,2018,Summation,"{¶14} Appellant argues that, during closing arguments, the prosecutor improperly vouched for the victim’s credibility and accused him of lying during his testimony.
Appellant concedes that he is limited to a plain error analysis as his trial counsel failed to object to the comments.",No error,"{¶24} Regardless, the evidence presented at trial directly contradicted Appellant’s
version of the facts. The victim’s statements during the investigation and her trial
testimony was largely corroborated by the nurse examiner’s testimony that the injuries
suffered by the victim were consistent with force and inconsistent with consensual
intercourse. Thus, while a prosecutor should avoid such comments whenever possible,
the comment regarding Appellant’s truthfulness was not improper.
{¶25} The state’s second comment addressed the victim’s credibility. “It is
improper for a prosecutor to vouch for the credibility of a witness at trial. Vouching occurs
when the prosecutor implies knowledge of facts outside the record or places his or her
personal credibility in issue.” Myers at ¶ 145, citing State v. Jackson, 107 Ohio St.3d 53,
2005-Ohio-5981, 836 N.E.2d 1173, ¶ 117; State v. Davis, 116 Ohio St.3d 404, 2008-Ohio2, 880 N.E.2d 31, ¶ 232. 

There is no indication that the state’s comment was based on evidence outside the record and the state did not imply such outside knowledge. Further, there is nothing within the record to suggest that the prosecutor placed her own credibility at issue. As such, the prosecutor did not improperly vouch for the victim’s credibility.
{¶27} Even assuming, arguendo, that the state’s comments were improper, such comments do “not affect a substantial right of the accused if it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury would have found the defendant guilty even without the improper comments.”",,,Cheryl L.

{¶9} Appellant points to the prosecutor’s statement that certain witnesses were “telling the truth” and the prosecutor’s description of a witness’s cross-examination as involving “desperation from the defense that they couldn’t attack his account. Because it
was bulletproof. Because it was the truth.” (Tr. 1576, 1591-1592). 

Appellant concludes the state improperly vouched for the credibility of witnesses and attacked the integrity of defense counsel by suggesting he was desperate. On the latter topic, the prosecutor shall not denigrate or impute insincerity to defense counsel in the jury's presence. State
v. Davis, 116 Ohio St.3d 404, 2008-Ohio-2, 880 N.E.2d 31, ¶ 301. However, the characterization of certain questions asked of a witness as evincing a desperate strategy does not improperly denigrate defense counsel or cause prejudice.

**

{¶12} Appellant also points to the rebuttal portion of closing arguments stating the prosecutor made improper and prejudicial remarks when contesting a perceived defense theory that the state assisted in manufacturing facts to support the case. When the
prosecutor continued criticizing the perceived theory by noting who all would have to be involved, the defense objected. The court sustained the objection and instructed the state to move forward with the argument. (Tr. 1648). The prosecutor thereafter gave examples of what a dishonest set of witnesses or investigators could have done to make the case
stronger and concluded, “I mean, let’s face it, if we’re going to lie, let’s really lie.” (Tr. 1651). We note the state was speaking of its own witnesses. ",Did not reach error/conduct did not result in prejudice,"{¶13} Also, this occurred in rebuttal, and the prosecutor’s comments directly responding to arguments advanced by the defense are unlikely to constitute grounds for reversal. State v. Miller, 7th Dist. No. 17 MA 0120, 2018-Ohio-5127, ¶ 25. The closing argument presented by counsel for Appellant’s co-defendant/brother asserted various witnesses manufactured stories to receive deals or for their own purposes. (Tr. 1622- 1623, 1627-1628).

 It also suggested the police put pressure on witnesses to make certain
statements that would help the state’s case. (Tr. 1612-1613, 1621). The closing presented by Appellant’s counsel stated a fatal flaw in the state’s case was that the detective fed Appellant’s name to a witness. (Tr. 1639-1640). The response by the state, even if exaggerated, does not give rise to concerns about a fair trial. Prejudice is not apparent.

And what I mean by that is that, no one got on the stand to contradict what [the victim] and [the boyfriend] said.”

the prosecutor’s statement that “no one got on the stand” to contradict the victim’s and the boyfriend’s testimony, based on the particular facts of this case, was a thinly veiled reference to Croskey. He was the only other person present during all three incidents able to offer any relevant testimony at trial.

The state did not have a valid justification for pinning the victim’s and the boyfriend’s credibility to Croskey’s postarrest and trial silence when Croskey challenged the lack of a prearrest investigation.",Harmful error,"In this case, the prosecutor’s comments were directed at the
credibility of the only two witnesses to offer evidence in support of a conviction. The state is relying on Croskey’s silence to claim that the victim’s and the boyfriend’s testimonial evidence was unconverted.

taking the stand to contradict their statements went to the heart of the matter. State v. Stephens, 24 Ohio St.2d 76, 263 N.E.2d 773 (1970). LaMar is inapplicable, and we cannot say the error in this case is harmless.

SCARPELLI,St. John,Ryan Lucas,Ryan Lucas St. John,White,2017,Murder,murder,"Felonious assault, child endagering",,checked,Male,18 years to life,,2017,Other or unknown,"{¶ 108} In his fifth assignment of error, St. John claims that the prosecutors engaged in misconduct by asking for an instruction on flight, by presenting testimony of a jailhouse informant, by “not play[ing] fair” with the medical expert testimony regarding
when the injury occurred, and by failing to point out that Brayden had a prior head injury.",No error,"{¶ 111} First, we conclude that the prosecutors did not engage in misconduct when they requested an instruction on flight. As discussed above, the evidence at trial supported an inference that, after Brayden was taken to the hospital, St. John fled from
the apartment to avoid the police. St. John may have had a motivation other than consciousness of guilt for leaving the apartment and not wanting to talk with the police.
Nevertheless, because the evidence at trial reasonably raised an inference that St. John’s actions were based on consciousness of guilty, the prosecutors did not act improperly in
requesting a jury instruction on flight. 

{¶ 112} Second, we find nothing improper in the prosecutor’s calling Middleton, a jailhouse informant, to testify at trial. The record does not indicate that the prosecutors knowingly or recklessly offered untruthful testimony by Middleton. Middleton testified in detail about what allegedly occurred on the morning of February 13, 2017, while Kelsie was at traffic court and the Bureau of Motor Vehicles. His testimony included details
regarding the incident that had not been released to the public, and his testimony was generally consistent with other witnesses’ testimony. By way of example, Middleton testified that St. John indicated that he put on Finding Dory or Finding Nemo for Brayden; Kelsie testified that she showed of those movies for Brayden and that those were Brayden’s favorite movies; Brayden’s bedroom was decorated in a Finding Nemo theme.
Significantly, St. John admitted to his brother that he (St. John) had spoken with Middleton about the incident and that Middleton “knows a lot of details, that’s because I f***ing told
him, like a ret**d. That was my fault.”

{¶ 113} Third, the record does not support St. John’s contention that the prosecutors engaged in misconduct with respect to Dr. Kamian’s medical opinion about the timing of Brayden’s injury. As discussed above, St. John had received a report from
the prosecution in December 2017, indicating Dr. Kamian’s opinion that Brayden’s injuries occurred between 3 and 6 hours before his surgery. Moreover, as discussed above, we
agree with the trial court that Dr. Kamian’s summary of medical findings, which was provided to defense counsel, adequately placed St. John on notice of the basis for his
opinion that Brayden’s injuries were caused within that time frame.
{¶ 114} Finally, we find no prosecutorial misconduct in the prosecutor’s decision not to inform the jury that Brayden had previously suffered a head injury. To the contrary,
the absence of evidence regarding Brayden’s prior skull fracture appears to have been beneficial, rather than prejudicial, to St. John’s case. ",,prosecutorial misconduct,Froelich,Jeffrey E.

PROCESS RIGHTS TO A FAIR TRIAL WHEN THE PROSEUCTION COMMITTED ACTS OF MISCONDUCT DURING VOIR DIRE, TRIAL, AND CLOSING ARGUMENTS.

{¶ 68} Lester argues that the state committed misconduct when, during voir dire, the prosecutor used a puzzle analogy to explain reasonable doubt and used an analogy involving destroying a structure with dynamite to explain circumstantial evidence. Lester further argues that the state committed misconduct by allegedly coaching a witness' testimony, encouraging false testimony from another witness, and commenting on Lester's wife's failure to testify in his defense (THIS IS WHAT IS HARMLESS). Finally, Lester argues that the prosecutor committed misconduct during closing argument by referring to facts that were not in evidence. Lester concedes that he did not object to every claimed instance of prosecutorial misconduct and therefore the standard of review in those instances would be plain error.",Harmless error,"Therefore, the prosecutor's remarks were perhaps
inappropriate. However, Lester cannot demonstrate a changed outcome from these brief comments during voir dire.

{¶ 75} This court does not find that these comments deprived Lester of a fair trial. The analogy by the prosecutor was perhaps objectionable based on a potential similarity to the underlying facts of the case, and the state seemed to concede this point by immediately offering a clarifying remark.

court finds that the prosecutor's questioning was improper after the trial court sustained the objection. However, this court does not find that Lester was deprived of a fair trial or that his defense was in any way prejudiced by the comments. Lester was convicted on substantial evidence of his guilt and this court cannot find any likelihood of a changed outcome simply
because of these brief comments. Therefore, this court finds such improper questioning only resulted in harmless error.


{¶ 83} Finally, Lester argues that the prosecutor committed misconduct during closing argument based on two comments that Lester contends were unsupported by evidence.
Specifically, the prosecutor stated that smoke from the arson fire must have set off the security system motion detectors in the home and that Stacy had ""distanced"" himself from his family.
{¶ 84} Either of these comments were logical inferences based upon the evidence in the record. The evidence indicated that the fire was producing smoke and it is a reasonable assumption that smoke or heat could set off motion detectors. As to his other argument, Stacy testified that he hardly spoke with Lester, thus the comment about him distancing
himself from the family had some basis. Regardless, Lester fails to explain how either of these two statements caused him any prejudice and deprived him of a fair trial. Accordingly, this court overrules Lester's fifth assignment of error.",,,"HENDRICKSON, J.",Robert A. Hendrickson,"S. POWELL, P.J., and RINGLAND, J.","Michael E. Powell,Robert Ringland",Michael T.

the prosecutor was implying that defense counsel had been deceitful.

{¶ 62} Next, Tucker argues that the state committed misconduct when the
prosecutor encouraged the jury to engage in ""experiments"" with regard to the passage of time. The prosecutor encouraged jurors to ""take out your watches"" and allow 27 seconds to elapse, which was the length of the call between Linda Rose's cellular phone and Parker's cellular phone on the day before the fire. The prosecutor argued that this would demonstrate that 27 seconds was sufficient time for Tucker and Parker to confirm that they were proceeding with the arson plan.",No error,"This court does not find that the comment deprived Tucker of a fair trial. As
discussed above, the jury convicted Tucker on substantial evidence of his guilt. Moreover, this court presumes that jurors followed the trial court's instructions to disregard the comment.

{¶ 65} This court does not find that juror misconduct occurred or that the prosecutor encouraged juror misconduct. Juror misconduct cases involving experimentation typically involve a juror using extraneous tools, procedures, or methods to test a hypothesis, outside of jury deliberations.

However, the passage of time is a constant and is also a common experience of everyday life.

{¶ 63} During the trial in this case, the state acknowledged having informed Schlievert that the SANE nurse did a good job testifying, particularly with respect to her explanation of the hymen. While this inadvisable discussion arguably violated the separation of witnesses order, there is no indication that the information the state shared with Schlievert prior to his testimony had any impact on the testimony he provided thereafter. As noted by the state in its brief, Schlievert’s testimony at trial was consistent with his expert report that was authored on July 31, 2014, several years prior to the trial. Further, appellant had an opportunity to explore the impact of Schlievert’s discussion with the prosecutor during his cross-examination of Schlievert, but failed to do so.
Notably, Schlievert was asked on redirect examination whether the information he learned as a result of his discussion with the state impacted his testimony in any manner, and he responded in the negative. ",Did not reach error/conduct did not result in prejudice,"{¶ 64} In light of the foregoing, we conclude that appellant has failed to

Appellant again refers to the testimony of Det./Sgts. Spotleson and Martin that recounts Fletcher’s statements, reference to Fletcher’s statements by the state during closing argument, and the state’s decision to call Fletcher’s attorney as a rebuttal witness in this case.
{¶42} Regarding the testimony of Det./Sgts. Spotleson and Martin, Appellant
contends both officers improperly vouched for Fletcher’s credibility. During this testimony the state asked both whether the statements made by Fletcher were corroborated by the findings of the medical examiner and were corroborated by other information regarding the scene of the incident. (1/3/17 Tr., pp. 320, 418-419.)",No error,"Testifying about whether witness statements match other findings of an investigation is not akin to vouching for that witness’ credibility. No improper vouching occurs so long as the prosecutor or the witness does not express any personal belief about another witness’ credibility. Davis, at ¶ 241. While improper on other grounds, there was no improper vouching for the credibility of the declarant, here.

{¶52} Contrary to Appellant’s assertion, we do not find the rebuttal witness’
testimony prejudicial to Appellant. If anything, placing Attorney Kivilighan on the stand as a witness could only serve to hurt the state’s case. Fletcher invoked her Fifth Amendment
privilege in front of the jury. This resulted in the codefendant in the case appearing to admit to a degree of culpability in the matter. By placing her attorney on the stand, the state now reminded the jury that Appellant’s codefendant in the case invoked her privilege
against self-incrimination. This scenario has the opposite effect of creating prejudice to Appellant, because it appears that it should only serve to create doubt as to Appellant’s guilt.

In fact, if it caused any harm this harm could onlybe on the state which had elected not to call Fletcher as a witness. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the rebuttal testimony nor did any prosecutorial misconduct occur.

",No error,"{¶20} Rafter did not object when the state, during its closing argument, told the jury that a state highway patrol trooper who investigated the crash “told you that based on the information and the sketch that he was able to draw, based on his measurements, that this act was intentional
* * *.” In fact, the trooper testified that he was not doing a crash reconstruction and that in a call with local police who were handling the investigation, he stressed that the highway patrol was
not doing a crash report “because the information that was provided to us was an intentional act and not a crash accident.” The state thus mischaracterized this testimony. The trooper did not give an opinion, based on his measurements at the scene, that Rafter acted intentionally; he said only that he had been told that Rafter acted intentionally. That mischaracterization, however, was slight enough that it did not result in a manifest miscarriage of justice warranting a new trial. 

{¶21} Rafter likewise failed to object when the state told the jury that for purposes of felonious assault, it did not need to prove that Rafter acted with a purpose to kill the victim but need only prove that he acted knowing that his conduct “could cause” that result. The state noe concedes that the proper definition of “knowingly” is that a person’s conduct “will probably cause a certain result.” See R.C. 2901.22(B). Even if this rises to the level of plain error, we exercise our discretion to disregard it given that we have affirmed the conviction for aggravated murder and as previously noted, the court merged the sentence for felonious assault into the aggravated murder count.

{¶22} Finally, Rafter failed to object to the state’s comment that the expert mechanic said that Rafter drove straight for the victim’s car, without taking any evasive maneuvers, because the expert said that he could not recover Rafter’s steering wheel data. We find no error because the cited part of closing argument referred to the eyewitness, not the expert mechanic. The state did not mischaracterize this testimony.

Gregory’s testimony during the state’s case-in-chief where he claims that his postarrest, post-Miranda silence was improperly referenced. 

In the first instance, the prosecutor asked the detective, who had investigated the shooting, whether he knew where Robinson had gone between the time of the shooting and the time he was found in Sally’s apartment. The detective responded that “[w]e did interviews of Jenika Sally. We did get some information from the defendant, but he declined to
make a statement.” Defense counsel objected, asserting that the state was not allowed to comment on the defendant’s failure to make a statement. The state argued it was merely explaining the course of the police investigation. The trial court overruled that objection. 

In the second instance, the state was questioning Gregory
about the course of the investigation, specifically about when Robinson’s DNA was taken, asking “during that attempt to interview the defendant, did you also perform swabs on the defendant?” Gregory responded that the swab was taken at a later date.
Defense counsel did not object to this question. In the third instance, the state began to ask the question “when [was] the first time you heard of any self-defense * * *.”
The prosecutor did not complete the question before defense counsel objected, and the trial court sustained the objection. 

{¶38} In addition to the three cited instances during Gregory’s testimony,
Robinson also claims that comments made by the state during closing arguments improperly referenced his post-Miranda decision to remain silent. 
During closing, the assistant prosecuting attorney stated that Robinson had had eight months, which was the time that had elapsed between the shootings and trial, to review the evidence before telling his story, and that Robinson “conveniently” had facts to counter the strongest evidence against him. Counsel objected, but the objection related to the use of the word “conveniently.” The objection was overruled. The prosecutor also said during closing, without objection, that Robinson had had eight months “to think about what kind of bullcrap lies to tell * * * .”

***
In his third assignment of error, Robinson claims his right to a fair trial was compromised when the state failed to present material evidence to the coroner, which resulted in the coroner’s conclusions being unreliable.

{¶50} In his third assignment of error, Robinson claims that his right to a
fair trial was compromised when the state failed to correct erroneous testimony from the assistant coroner, who estimated the distance from which the victims were shot based on the lack of gunshot stippling on Lane’s skin. The assistant coroner had not been informed that there was a sweatshirt in evidence with bullet holes in it, which could have been worn by Lane when he was shot, and would have negated her conclusion about the distance between Robinson and Lane. ",Harmless error,"{¶42} Finally, accepting that the challenged comments during the state’s
closing were not just fair commentary on Robinson’s credibility in light of his pre-Miranda silence, but also impermissibly encouraged the jury to infer Robinson’s guilt from his silence, the impact on the jury from these impermissible references to Robinson’s silence, when considered along with the impermissible references to Robinson’s silence during the state’s case-in-chief, could not be sufficient to warrant the reversal of Robinson’s convictions, because the error caused by the state’s improper use of Robinson’s silence was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. 

{¶46} We conclude that the brief, improper comments at issue here did not permeate or taint the lengthy proceedings in light of the overwhelming evidence of guilt. Consequently, we hold the trial court erred when it allowed the state to present evidence of Robinson’s silence as substantive evidence of his guilt, but that any prejudice from the state’s improper use of Robinson’s silence was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt as the evidence against him was overwhelming. Accordingly, we overrule Robinson’s first assignment of error. 

**

{¶52} But, unlike in Napue, the misinformation in this case was corrected.
On cross-examination, defense counsel presented the sweatshirt to the coroner, who admitted she had not examined it before. The coroner admitted that she would have wanted to examine the sweatshirt, and that had the victim been wearing the sweatshirt, her findings would have been different. Since the jury was able to hear how wearing the sweatshirt would have changed her calculations of distance, we cannot conclude that Robinson’s due-process rights were violated by the initial testimony presented by the state. We overrule his third assignment of error. ",Resentencing,Napue v. Illinois,Mock,Russell Mock,Cunningham and Miller,"Penelope R. Cunningham,Charles M. Miller",Joseph T. Deters,Joseph T.

Farnbacher,Parham,Clemon D. ,Clemon D.  Parham,Black,2016,Murder,Felony murder,Aggravated robbery,,,,18 years to life,,2016,"Examination of witnesses,Summation","{¶ 59} Parham first contends that the prosecutor engaged in misconduct when questioning witnesses. Parham primarily attacks the prosecutor's questioning of Aaliyah Dunson, Gregory Dunson's ex-wife. In 2011, Aaliyah Dunson overheard Parham and
Dunson discussing a murder. Under direct-examination, Aaliyah Dunson testified that she heard Parham tell Dunson about ""a gentleman who they had beat to death and left naked or half-naked in the apartment complex parking lot."" (Tr. Vol. IV at 80.)

**

{¶ 63} Parham also points to multiple instances in the transcript where he contends the prosecutor improperly asked leading questions or suggested the answers she wanted in her questions. In about half of these instances, the trial court sustained objections to the questions at issue and the prosecutor either rephrased or withdrew the question. ""As a general rule, when the trial court sustains objections to a leading question and the prosecutor rephrases the question, the defendant is not deprived of a fair trial."" State v. Oteng, 10th Dist. No. 14AP-466, 2015-Ohio-1231, ¶ 49; accord Thompson, 141 Ohio St.3d
254, 2014-Ohio-4751, at ¶ 171 (""The trial court sustained objections to the first two questions cited by [the defendant], so they cannot be the basis for a misconduct claim."");
State v. Diar, 120 Ohio St.3d 460, 2008-Ohio-6266, ¶ 209 (holding that no prejudice occurs when a trial court sustains an objection to a leading question and the prosecutor rephrases the question in a nonleading manner or does not repeat the question).
Consequently, we conclude that, where the trial court sustained an objection to the prosecutor's question, the improper nature of the question did not prejudice Parham's substantial rights. 

**

¶ 65} Next, Parham contends that the prosecutor ""improperly socialized with and prepped"" Gregory Dunson. (Appellant's Brief at 36.) Parham also complains that the prosecutor offered to assist Dunson in obtaining court-appointed counsel after she discovered that Dunson had run out of funds to pay his attorney. 

**

{¶ 73} Finally, Parham contends that the prosecutor improperly stated during closing argument that Aaliyah Dunson testified that she heard Parham admit to murdering Connal. As we explained above, this statement mischaracterizes Dunson's testimony.
However, appellate courts ""view the state's closing argument in is entirety to determine whether the allegedly improper remarks were prejudicial."" State v. Treesh, 90 Ohio St.3d
460, 466 (2001). The prosecutor referred to Aaliyah Dunson's testimony only once during the closing argument, so the prosecutor's improper statement did not so permeate the state's closing that it denied Parham a fair trial. ",No error,"{¶ 61} On appeal, Parham argues that the prosecutor erroneously incorporated into her question a fact not in evidence; namely, that Aaliyah Dunson heard Parham admit to
being involved in a murder. "" 'It is improper for an attorney, under the pretext of putting a question to a witness, to put before the jury information that is not supported by the
evidence.' "" State v. Davis, 10th Dist. No. 01AP-579, 2002-Ohio-1920, ¶ 63, quoting State
v. Smidi, 88 Ohio App.3d 177, 183 (6th Dist.1993). However, we cannot fault the prosecutor here. Aaliyah Dunson testified that she could not recall if Parham said he committed the murder, but she also testified that Parham was talking like someone involved in the murder. 
It appears that, in the heat of trial, the prosecutor construed the latter testimony as negating the former testimony. The prosecutor was mistaken: speaking in a manner that causes a listener to surmise the speaker was involved in a murder does not equate to an admission of involvement in the murder. However, given the subtlety of this point, we conclude that
the mistake did not rise to the level of misconduct. 

**{¶ 62} Additionally, the trial court sustained Parham's attorney's objections to the question at issue and instructed the jury to disregard a question if the court sustained an objection to it. A court must presume that the jury followed the court's instruction. State
v. Mammone, 139 Ohio St.3d 467, 2014-Ohio-1942, ¶ 147. We, therefore, must presume that the jury ignored the substance of the question at issue. Consequently, we conclude that even if the prosecutor engaged in misconduct in the questioning of Aaliyah Dunson, that
misconduct did not deprive Parham of a fair trial.

**

{¶ 64} In the remaining instances Parham directs us to, Parham did not object to the questions at issue. If a defendant fails to object to the alleged misconduct in the trial court, an appellate court reviews the claim of misconduct for plain error. Mammone at
¶ 111. Here, we find no plain error because the questions at issue either covered matters of little relevance or elicited information introduced elsewhere during trial. See Diar at ¶ 170,
172, 180 (finding no plain error in leading questions where, in some instances, the testimony elicited had little to no relevance and, in other instances, the testimony elicited
duplicated other testimony). 

**

{¶ 68} ""A prosecutor is free to prepare witnesses and review their expected testimony with them."" State v. McCoy, 10th Dist. No. 99AP-1048 (Sept. 7, 2000). Here,
there is no evidence that the prosecutor did anything untoward during her preparation of Dunson to take the stand. In fact, given the state of this record, defense counsel's accusations that the prosecutor engaged in misconduct during witness preparation are, at
the very least, troubling to this court. 

**

{¶ 74} We also note that Aaliyah Dunson's actual testimony—that Parham talked about Connal's murder like someone involved in the murder—is consistent with her exhusband's testimony. Gregory Dunson confirmed that Parham admitted to his involvement in Connal's murder during the conversation Aaliyah Dunson overheard. Thus, even without the prosecutor's mischaracterization of Aaliyah Dunson's testimony, it is clear
beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury would have convicted Parham. ",,prosecutorial misconduct,Klatt,William A. Klatt,"Sadler, Tyack","Lisa L. Sadler,G.

According to Patton, the prosecutor’s references to the Chevy Sonic’s rear view mirror were improper because they were based on facts outside the evidence. Absent these remarks, Patton argues that there was insufficient evidence to establish that Patton had a “purpose to deprive” the victim of her motor vehicle. Therefore, Patton asserts that a reasonable probability exists, absent the prosecutor’s improper remarks, that the jury would not have found him guilty of Grand Theft of a Motor Vehicle. ",Did not reach error/conduct did not result in prejudice,"{¶16} However, even assuming that these comments were improper, we cannot find that Patton was denied a fair trial.

{¶17} In light of the evidence before the jury, we cannot find that a reasonable probability exists that, absent the comments by the prosecution, the jury would have found Patton not guilty of Grand Theft of a Motor Vehicle. According to the jury instructions, “deprive” means to “[w]ithhold property of another permanently * * *.” (Tr. at 163). Even though Patton told Officer Day that he was planning to return the vehicle to the parking lot after he visited his uncle, overwhelming competent and credible evidence contradicts his statement.
Because no reasonable probability exists that the outcome of Patton’s trial would have been different had the prosecution not mentioned the Chevy Sonic’s rear view mirror, we find that any alleged prosecutorial misconduct did not deprive Patton of his right to a fair trial.

{¶28} Mr. Vaughn was charged with possessing criminal tools – essentially, the baggies. In closing argument, defense counsel made the following argument on this point. 
{¶29} Defense Counsel: “Let’s start by some of the obvious things. Now first of all, the prosecutor has shown you all these pictures of these baggie, with the corners torn, cut, whatever you want to believe. First of all, my wife and I take care of my five grandchildren every day, and she packs lunches every day. They’re in baggies, so you’d find baggies in my house by the ton. Also, I have a chess game, computer chess
game, and I have baggies I keep my men in.”

{¶30} In rebuttal, the assistant prosecutor told the jury the following.
{¶31} Assistant Prosecutor: “One funny thing Mr. PerDue talked about, and it’s about the plastic bags. Most of us use them to store something in, pack our lunches in, keep our slice of apple pie in so it doesn’t get contaminated or anything. But there was no evidence presented that Cregg Vaughn made any type of sandwiches for his three
year old girl. There’s no evidence of anything beyond packing heroin in those plastic bags.” (Emphasis added.)
{¶32} Appellant argues that this statement by the assistant prosecutor strongly implied to the jury that appellant was required to testify, in denial of his right to remain silent, and that the trial court should have declared a mistrial (which defense counsel requested). We do not agree. ",No error,"{¶37} We acknowledge the well-settled position that a prosecutor may
not comment on a defendant’s failure to testify. Griffin v. California (1965), 380 U.S. 609 (1965); State v. Fears, 86 Ohio St .3d 329, 336 (1999). The prosecutor, however, did not specifically do so in this matter. Moreover, it bears noting that the prosecution is entitled to comment on defendant’s failure to offer evidence. State v. Collins, 89 Ohio
St.3d 524, 527 (2000); see also State v. Simpson, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 19797, 2004–Ohio–669, at ¶65. “Such comments do not imply [nor] necessarily constitute a
penalty on the defendant’s exercise of his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent.” Collins, supra. The test for prosecutorial misconduct vis-a-vis a defendant’s failure to
testify is “whether the language used was manifestly intended or was of such character that the jury would naturally and necessarily take it to be a comment on the failure of the
accused to testify.” State v. Webb, 70 Ohio St.3d 325, 328 (1994), quoting Knowles v. United States, 224 F.2d 168, 170 (10th Cir.1955). Here, the prosecutor’s language did not evince an intention that the jury draw a forbidden inference relating to appellant’s exercise of his right against self-incrimination.

Schaaf,White,2017,Murder,Aggravated Murder,tampering with evidence,,,Male,25 years to life,,2017,"Jury selection,Examination of witnesses","{¶ 14} Schaaf argues that the state deprived him of a fair trial when the prosecutor, during voir dire, stated that there would be no trial if there was no dispute as to what occurred between Schaaf and Jonathon. 


During voir dire, the prosecutor stated:
Does everyone understand that if everyone in this room agreed
about what happened on December 26th, 2016, there wouldn't be
a need for a trial? In other words, there likely will be a conflict of
evidence in this case. Is there anyone who doesn't understand
that? 


Schaaf also argues that the state deprived him of a fair trial
when a detective testified that Schaaf told the police he would not speak to them on the advice of counsel. Schaaf concedes that he did not object to either claimed instance of error and is limited to a review for plain error. 


{¶ 18} Next, Schaaf argues that the prosecutor committed misconduct by eliciting testimony from a detective concerning Schaaf's right to remain silent. During direct examination, the prosecutor asked the detective what the status of the police investigation was prior to Schaaf's admission to involvement in the homicide. The detective's response explained the various reasons why law enforcement focused its effort on Schaaf as the primary suspect. Those reasons included that the killer had draped a towel over the body, indicating a personal relationship with Jonathon, that the blood on scene appeared coagulated and inconsistent with Schaaf's timeline, Schaaf's demeanor, his failure to contact law enforcement for updates on the investigation for over two weeks following the death, and
Schaaf's cancellation of a police interview. With respect to this cancellation, the detective stated that Schaaf called and left a voice message stating that he had talked to his attorney, who advised him not to speak to the police. ",Harmless error,"{¶ 17} These statements were appropriate and accurately relayed to jurors that facts are contested in every trial. The remarks appeared designed to prepare jurors for the unique task of resolving conflicts in evidence in rendering a verdict. The questions posed by the prosecutor were neutrally phrased and did not insinuate that only a guilty or dishonest individual would seek a trial. 

**

{¶ 20} In this case, detective's testimony on direct examination concerning Schaaf cancelling an appointment based on his attorney's advice not to speak with police was the state's use of pre-arrest silence as substantive evidence of appellant's guilt and was error.
However, assuming a Fifth Amendment violation occurred, this court would not find that Schaaf was deprived of a fair trial. As will be addressed below, the murder verdicts were supported by substantial evidence of Schaaf's guilt. 

 Moreover, any error would be harmless because jurors were aware
that Schaaf later voluntarily agreed to speak with police and provided them with his version of events wherein he set forth his claim of self-defense.

Poprocki,Rivera,Edwin,Edwin Rivera,Other,2013,Sexual violence,Sexual battery,Gross sexual imposition,,,Female,3 years of community control,,2013,Examination of witnesses,"{¶15} In his first and third assignments of error, Mr. Rivera argues that he was denied a fair trial because the State improperly bolstered G.O.’s testimony and engaged in prosecutorial
misconduct. For the following reasons, this Court rejects his arguments. 

**

{¶22} Mr. Rivera argues that the State engaged in misconduct and denied him a fair trial when it: (1) repeatedly elicited hearsay and double hearsay from its witnesses in an attempt to bolster G.O.’s credibility and undermine his character; (2) essentially tendered Detective
Dietsche as an expert in the areas of sexual assault investigations, delayed disclosures, and grooming, despite the fact that she was not qualified to testify to that effect; (3) otherwise
elicited improper conclusions from the detective (e.g., that G.O. obviously suffered from cognitive and developmental delays); (4) violated Evid.R. 608 by repeatedly asking the detective whether various portions of G.O.’s in-court testimony were consistent with her interview
statements; (5) improperly and repeatedly equated G.O. with a child, despite the fact that she was nineteen years old when these events occurred; and (6) elicited testimony about alleged,
improper conduct that pre-dated the indictment period. Mr. Rivera further argues that the cumulative effect of the foregoing misconduct deprived him of a fair trial. ",No error,"{¶27} To the extent the State argued that G.O. “would act like a twelve-year-old,” then record reflects that the prosecutor was merely repeating one of Mr. Rivera’s interview statements. While speaking with Detective Dietsche, Mr. Rivera specifically compared G.O.’s
behavior to that of a twelve-year-old. Mr. Rivera has not explained how the prosecutor’s mere repetition of his own statement amounted to misconduct. Accordingly, he has not shown that an actual error occurred for purposes of plain error review. See Barnes at 27. 

{¶28} With respect to the remainder of Mr. Rivera’s plain error argument, this Court cannot conclude that he has demonstrated prejudice. Assuming without deciding that the prosecutor engaged in misconduct when Detective Dietsche testified that people like G.O. were “easily victimized” and otherwise equated her with a juvenile, Mr. Rivera has not shown that her testimony actually affected the outcome of his trial. See id. G.O. and her mother clearly testified that G.O. was nineteen years old at the time these events transpired, so the jury was well aware
that she was not, in fact, a juvenile. Moreover, the jurors heard both G.O. and Mr. Rivera testify, so they had ample opportunity to judge their credibility and form their own impressions about
G.O.’s cognitive abilities. See State v. Johnson, 9th Dist. Summit No. 25161, 2010-Ohio-3296, ¶
15. As noted, notice of plain error is appropriate only in “exceptional circumstances and only to prevent a manifest miscarriage of justice.” Long, 53 Ohio St.2d 91 at paragraph three of the syllabus. Upon review, Mr. Rivera has not shown that the admission of the foregoing testimony
warrants such relief. See id.

{¶29} The record does support the conclusion that Mr. Rivera objected to two instances of alleged misconduct. First, he objected when Detective Dietsche made several other statements about G.O.’s cognitive abilities. Those statements were that G.O. had been “easily
confused by [the prosecutor] or by the defense attorney” when testifying and that she was “not developed enough to be able to really qualify [her] statements” about when Mr. Rivera’s abuse began/ended. Second, he objected when the State attempted to ask the sexual assault nurse
examiner questions about the limits of G.O.’s cognitive abilities. Those questions related to the nurse examiner’s experience examining young children and her impression of G.O.’s intelligence (i.e., whether she appeared to possess average intelligence for her age). 

{¶30} Assuming without deciding that the foregoing exchanges were the result of improper questioning on the part of the prosecutor, Mr. Rivera has not shown that, but for the misconduct, the jury would not have convicted him. Lollis, 9th Dist. Summit No. 24826, 2010-
Ohio-4457, ¶ 24. When G.O. testified, the jury had the opportunity to assess her ability to comprehend and respond to questions. The record reflects that she repeatedly failed to understand questions and changed her answers, depending on how a question was phrased. The
jury also heard testimony that she had a learning disability, attended special education classes to receive her high school degree at the age of twenty, was subject to a guardianship, and received
SSI. When interviewed, Mr. Rivera specifically admitted that G.O. had a learning disability, did not understand boundaries, and would act like a twelve-year-old. Accordingly, even if the
prosecutor asked Detective Dietsche and the nurse examiner certain improper questions about G.O.’s cognitive abilities, the record contains a wealth of other evidence from which the jury reasonably could have concluded that G.O. was substantially impaired. Mr. Rivera, therefore,
has not shown that he suffered actual prejudice as a result of the prosecutor’s alleged misconduct. See Smith, 14 Ohio St.3d at 14.

The trial court erred when it permitted the testimony of Robert
Flores. The state did not disclose this witness prior to the start of trial.

Sanders’s initial argument is that because the state committed a
discovery violation by failing to disclose Flores as a witness until midway through trial. According to Sanders, the state knew, or should have known, about Flores’s involvement in the case months before trial when they received surveillance video evidence showing Flores. According to the state, none of their witnesses mentioned that Flores was present in the apartment at the time of the shooting until McMillan and Calhoun testified to that effect at trial. ",Harmless error,"Upon review of the record, it is not clear that the state willfully failed
to disclose Flores as a witness. While Sanders argues that the state knew, or should have known, that Flores was present at Calhoun’s house the day of the shooting, this argument is not supported by the record. According to Sanders, the state should have known or ascertained the identity of an unidentified individual walking down the street near Calhoun’s apartment and determined that this individual was present at the shooting. We cannot conclude that what may have been a failure to thoroughly investigate the identity of an additional witness was a willful discovery violation. 

Moreover, it is not clear from the record that foreknowledge of the state’s intention to call Flores as a witness would have benefitted Sanders, or that he was prejudiced by the late disclosure.

Finally, we note that in response to the late disclosure, the court provided defense counsel an opportunity to examine Flores outside of the presence of the jury. Even if the state committed a discovery violation, this remedy was appropriate. Because the trial court did not commit an abuse of discretion in allowing Flores to testify, Sanders’s second assignment of error is overruled. ",,,RAYMOND C. HEADEN,Raymond C.

Johnson argues that the state’s failure to provide timely discovery, namely surveillance video footage of the victim’s front porch, caused prejudice because it impacted the defense theory presented in opening statement and upon cross-examination and therefore a mistrial was warranted.",Harmless error,"The record clearly demonstrates that the prosecution’s failure to disclose the CD containing the raw footage of the camera angle from the side of the house was not willful. The prosecution provided the defense with what it believed to be discs of all of the camera angles obtained from the victim’s surveillance camera, only to learn during trial, at the same time as the defense, that it mistakenly failed to provide a copy of a disc containing the camera angle from one side of the house.

And while the defense would likely have benefitted from learning of the existence of this camera angle, we find little, if any, evidence of prejudice. The court provided defense counsel two opportunities to review the video, counsel
acknowledged he reviewed “hours” of the video, including the footage from “hours before and hours after” the homicide, and the trial court excluded the video containing the raw footage that the defense had not previously received, with the exception of the raw footage for the period of time surrounding the homicide",,,MICHELLE J.

On appeal he challenges the sufficiency and weight of the evidence supporting his convictions, the application of Ohio’s rape-shield statute to the exclusion of evidence in this case, the admission of Detective Noel’s testimony despite the lack of an expert witness report pursuant to Crim.R. 16(K), and finally, prosecutorial misconduct based on statements made by the state during closing arguments.

Crim.R. 16:
{¶9} With count 12 resolved, we turn our focus to the third assignment of error,
relating to the admission of expert testimony by Detective Noel, which we ultimately find dispositive. The trial court admitted Detective Noel’s testimony at trial as an “expert in investigating child abuse and neglect,” and she offered several opinions in this vein. We note that while the standard for reviewing the trial court’s admission of expert testimony is for abuse of discretion, an error of law can constitute an abuse of discretion. Valentine v. Conrad, 110 Ohio St.3d 42, 2006-Ohio-3561, 850 N.E.2d 683, ¶ 9; see State v. Boles, 187 Ohio App.3d 345, 2010-Ohio-278, 932 N.E.2d 345, ¶ 24-25 (2d Dist.) (explaining that trial court could in fact abuse its discretion by committing an error of law). Defense counsel duly objected to Detective Noel’s testimony, arguing that the state furnished no Crim.R. 16(K) report.

the prosecutor engaged in pervasive misconduct during closing argument, demonizing the defendant as a “wolf” and “predator,” and repeatedly vouching for the credibility of the accusers.",Harmful error,"Crim.R.16:
{¶12} No one disputes that the state failed to provide a Crim.R. 16(K)-compliant expert report. The state points out, however, that it did tender an investigatory report that documented Detective Noel’s investigation, but it faces two problems here. First, the investigatory report (as best we can tell) never found its way into the record, which precludes the state from seeking refuge in it now. Second, and more fundamentally, a world of difference exists between an investigatory report (“I observed this during my investigation”) and an expert report (“I’m qualified as an expert and here are my opinions”).2 To its credit, the state does not pretend that the investigatory report actually reveals any expert opinions. As a result, even if it were contained within the record, it would not satisfy the basic requirements of the rule. {¶20} Detective Noel’s opinions constitute expert opinions submitted without a report in contravention of the plain language of Crim.R. 16(K). The trial court committed error by allowing these opinions to reach the jury, and accordingly we must now evaluate whether this error was harmless. 
(23) ...In sum, the defense was prejudiced by the denial of the opportunity to fully challenge Detective Noel’s testimony. {¶24} Furthermore, this error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.



We accordingly turn to the closing argument. Reviewing a challenge of
prosecutorial misconduct in closing argument requires evaluation of whether the comments were improper and prejudicial to the accused’s substantial rights. State v. Williams, 99 Ohio St.3d 439, 2003-Ohio-4164, 793 N.E.2d 446, ¶ 44. Prosecutorial misconduct determinations require that “on the record as a whole, the misconduct can be said to have deprived the appellant of a fair trial.” State v. Hunter, 1st Dist. Hamilton Nos. C-140684, C-
140704 and C-140717, 2016-Ohio-123, ¶ 34. 

On appeal, Mr. Hall draws our attention to the following discourse by the prosecutor during closing argument: 
""This defendant, this predator, told you that he is the victim of a conspiracy of little girls. * * * Do not be fooled. [Mr. Hall] is a wolf and he is the predator. He raped [J.C.] by raping her with his penis. He raped her vaginally by penetrating her vagina with his penis. He did this at her house.
* * He forced her to touch his penis with her hand. That’s rape, gross sexual
imposition.
* * *
Predators like his man, Randy Hall, pick their victims wisely so there isn’t
corroboration. He knows how to deal with these girls. He was nice to them,
but also sort of threatening and controlling. He chose easy targets.
* * *
After reviewing the evidence and applying the law, justice demands that this
defendant, this predator, be found guilty of these charges. Any verdict other
than guilty would not be reasonable, it would defy common sense, and it
would be contrary to your instructions.""

these comments improper because they are in the same vein of comments that we have repeatedly deemed inappropriate.



When the jury’s determination of guilt rests solely on the question of which
testimony they believed, the victims’ or Mr. Hall’s, the prosecutor’s conduct (denigrating the defendant, calling him a “wolf” and a “predator,” vouching for the state’s witnesses) compounded the problems inherent in admitting Detective Noel’s testimony. And under the circumstances, we cannot say with any degree of confidence that the jury’s determination here was based on the actual credibility of the witnesses rather than the errors at trial because the errors were so significant in terms of their impact on credibility. Thus, Mr. Hall
was prejudiced by the admission of the expert testimony, it is not clear beyond a reasonable doubt that this error did not affect the outcome, and the strength of the remaining evidence was no doubt buttressed by Detective Noel’s testimony. In sum, under these circumstances the admission of Detective Noel’s testimony constituted prejudicial, rather than harmless, error.",,"prosecutorial misconduct,Crim.R. 16",Bergeron,Pierre H.

This case will definitely be of interest. There was a second error that was borderline a trial error but basically, the state did not follow proper Crim.R. 16 16(k) procedures which require the state to follow certain procedures to secure an expert witness to testify. The trial erred in allowing the state to move forward with the expert. The court here is holding that this in conjunction with the improper closing remarks constituted harmful error.

{¶16} Williams argues that the court erred in denying his motion because he set forth substantive grounds for relief where the petition showed that the state withheld evidence that was ""material"" to his decision to accept or decline the state's plea offer. See Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 87, 83 S.Ct.1194 (1963). Williams argues that the state committed a Brady violation, which resulted in a plea that was less than knowing, intelligent, and informed. ",No error,"{¶25} Finally, we note that there is no evidence that the state's alleged failure to turn over the materials caused Williams to suffer any prejudice at sentencing. Williams does not contend, nor does the record indicate that the sentencing court ever possessed, much less reviewed, the evidence that Williams argues was wrongly withheld. Therefore, there is no evidence that the court's sentencing decision was impacted by the state's alleged failure to disclose the materials. And, as argued by Williams, it is probable that the court's sentence would have been greater had the court reviewed those materials prior to imposing sentence.

Specifically, appellant argues: (1) the prosecutor exploited every opportunity to have the jury hear testimony relating to the charge against appellant regarding K.T. which was dismissed prior to trial, (2) the prosecutor solicited information regarding additional uncharged accusations involving T.A., (3) the prosecutor failed to comply with the trial court's limiting instruction to exclude testimony or recordings relating to K.T., and
(4) the prosecutor made improper comments and vouched for the credibility of the witnesses in his closing argument. 

Other: Evidence Regarding Dismissed Charge
{¶ 53} Appellant alleges the prosecutor engaged in misconduct by exploiting opportunities to have the jury hear evidence regarding a dismissed charge involving K.T. Here again, as he argued in his first and fourth assignments of error, appellant takes issue with the presentation of evidence involving alleged abuse by appellant against K.T. As noted in our discussion regarding the fourth assignment of error, it does appear the prosecutor agreed to appellant's request to redact specific portions of the video testimony which addressed alleged abuse by appellant against K.T. Nevertheless, whether intentionally or inadvertently, portions of the video interview were played which referenced K.T.

Examination of Witness: 
{¶ 56} Appellant argues the indictment only charged him with seven counts as to T.A., yet the prosecutor goaded T.A. into testifying about more than ten alleged incidents. The prosecutor did present T.A. with some leading questions about how many times appellant abused her. Upon appellant's objection, the court noted that because T.A. was a child witness, he would give the prosecution some leverage to lead a little bit but not throughout all the incidents. The prosecutor resumed questioning in a general, open-ended manner regarding the details of the alleged incidents.

Other: Compliance with Limiting Instruction on Evidence
{¶ 58} As noted in our discussion of the fourth assignment of error, the court gave the jury a limiting instruction: ""Ladies and gentlemen, I am going to specifically instruct you that you are instructed to disregard and they are not evidence and must be treated as if you never heard any statements with respect to [K.T.]. Okay."" (July 21, 2017 Tr. Vol. IV at 670.) Appellant argues that despite this limiting instruction to the jury, the prosecutor persisted in eliciting impermissible evidence regarding K.T.

Summation:
{¶ 61} Appellant objected to the prosecutor's statement at closing, while referencing Counts 1 through 15, that ""[i]f they were not valid, you wouldn't be here, we wouldn't all be here."" (July 21, 2017 Tr. Vol. IV at 768.) However, the prosecutor went on to state the jury should consider each one of the charges; reminded the jury that ""it is for you to consider. And you should consider them independently."" (July 21, 2017 Tr. Vol. IV at 769.)",No error,"Other: Evidence Regarding Dismissed Charge
{¶ 55} ""[I]t is not prosecutorial misconduct to introduce evidence that the trial court has determined to be admissible."" State v. Perez, 124 Ohio St.2d 122, 2009-Ohio-6179, ¶ 187. With this in mind, we cannot say the prosecutor engaged in prosecutorial misconduct on these grounds. Furthermore, considering the context of the entire trial, we cannot say the prosecutor's actions prejudicially affected appellant's substantial rights. 

Examination of Witness:
{¶ 57} Prosecutorial misconduct can occur when a prosecutor continues to ask leading questions even after the trial court has sustained objections on that basis. McKelton at ¶ 265. However, here, the transcript reveals that after the prosecutor was cautioned by the court, he curtailed the leading nature of his questions. With this in mind, we cannot say the prosecutor engaged in prosecutorial misconduct on these grounds. Furthermore, considering the context of the entire trial, we cannot say the prosecutor's actions prejudicially affected appellant's substantial rights.

Other: Compliance with Limiting Instruction on Evidence
{¶ 60} Curative instructions are presumed to be an effective way to remedy errors that occur during trial. State v. Brown, 10th Dist. No. 15AP-935, 2016-Ohio-7944, ¶ 21, citing Treesh at 480. The jury is presumed to follow any such instructions. Id. With this in mind, we cannot say the prosecutor engaged in prosecutorial misconduct on these grounds. Furthermore, considering the context of the entire trial, we cannot say the prosecutor's actions prejudicially affected appellant's substantial rights

Summation:
{¶ 62} "" 'For a prosecutor's closing argument to be prejudicial, the remarks must be so inflammatory as to render the jury's decision a product solely of passion and prejudice.' ""
Ford at ¶ 385, quoting State v. Williams, 23 Ohio St.3d 16, 20 (1986). To determine whether the remarks were prejudicial, we must review the closing argument in its entirety. 
{¶ 63} With this in mind, we cannot say the prosecutor engaged in prosecutorial misconduct on these grounds. Furthermore, considering the prosecutor's closing argument in its entirety, we cannot say the prosecutor's actions prejudicially affected appellant's substantial rights. {¶ 64} Accordingly, we overrule the second assignment of error.

A woman once filed a petition for domestic violence that claimed D.L. physically and sexually assaulted her. Appellant claims the state did not disclose this later information. 
However, appellant was not unavoidably prevented from discovering this evidence. Initially, appellant does not contend he was unaware of D.L.'s criminal and sexual assault history.
Furthermore, it is mere speculation that any records relating to D.L.'s criminal and sexual assault history are exculpatory as related to the present case. There is nothing to support the theory that D.L. committed the actual abuse against D.W. in the present case. In addition, these records were public records which were freely and equally available to appellant. See State v. Stoutamire, 11th Dist. No. 2008-T-0108, 2009-Ohio-6228, ¶ 37. (court records are matters of public record, and were discoverable by the defense in preparation of trial); State v. Ross, 9th Dist. No. 23028, 2006-Ohio-4352, ¶ 27 (Brady does not require that a party disclose information which is part of a public record).
Therefore, this argument is without merit. ",No error,"{¶ 23} In denying appellant's motion for leave to file a motion for new trial, the trial court found appellant was not unavoidably prevented from discovering the evidence that formed the basis of the motion. We agree with the trial court.

Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215. 

{¶ 30} Hazel claims that the State was aware of, but did not disclose, certain documents to him. Specifically, Hazel states that individuals entered and exited the Clark County Jail to obtain the DNA samples from him, and the State should have provided jail records of their entry and exit. Hazel further states that the State should have provided the result of his DNA paternity test regarding H.K.’s child. 

",No error,"{¶ 31} We find no basis to conclude that the alleged undisclosed evidence was material. Although the jail records may substantiate that certain individuals came to the jail, they would provide no information regarding the paternity of H.K.’s child. With respect to the report of the DNA test results, we addressed and rejected Hazel’s argument in a prior appeal. We reasoned:
While the record indicates that Hazel was personally aware of the
DNA testing at the time of the 2011 trial, there is no evidence in this record that the State had possession of the test results or that the State had any knowledge that such testing had been conducted. Hazel, 2d Dist. ClarkcNo. 2017-CA-8, 2018-Ohio-766, ¶ 17; Hazel, S.D.Ohio No. 3:13-CV-332c2014 WL 4076152, *28. Thus, we have no basis upon which to conclude that the State committed a Brady violation.
Further, even had the State been aware of the testing, we cannot say
that the evidence was material. As we have previously noted with regard
to the 2003 conviction, the domestic violence statute did not require the
State to prove Hazel was actually the father of H.K.’s child. Instead, the
statute permitted the State to submit proof that he was the putative father.
The statute also sets forth various other definitions of family or household
member. R.C. 2919.25(F). In any event, “the State was not obliged to prove and did not undertake to prove that Hazel was the natural father of [H.K.'s child].
Instead, it had only to prove that he was convicted of aggravated burglary
where the underlying offense was committed against a family or household member. It succeeded in doing that by proving that the underlying offense was domestic violence, that [H.K.] was named in the bill of particulars, and that Hazel pled guilty under those circumstances. Having pled guilty, he waived his opportunity to put the State to its proof of the underlying domestic violence offense.” Hazel, S.D.Ohio No. 3:13-CV-332, 2014 WL 4076152, *28.

The trial court abused its discretion when it failed to hold a hearing

where the evidence support a potential Brady violation as well as a

leave to file a motion for new trial because he was incarcerated and did not have access to media or the internet while in prison to discover more information about the documentary. The state argues that the trial court properly denied leave because it is apparent that the evidence and exhibits Powell submitted to support his motion for leave could have been discovered within the 120-day time period set forth in Crim.R. 33(B)

The evidentiary materials Powell presented in support for his motion for leave to file in Exhibits A1-5 demonstrate that they were available in April 2018 when the documentary was shown on HBO, prior to his sentencing on May 14, 2018. Further, the rest of the materials Powell submitted with his motion for leave were dated either before trial or were transcripts from the trial.

For this reason, he asserts that the trial court erred in denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea.

 In hindsight, Kimpel may wish  that  he  had  made  a  different  decision,  but  he  failed  to  establish  that  he  was  unfairly  deprived  of  the  opportunity  to  make  an  informed  decision.    For  these  reasons, we find that no Brady violation occurred.  Kimpel has not, therefore, carried the  burden  of  establishing  a  manifest  miscarriage  of  justice.

{¶7}In  his  first  assignment  of  error,  Bowermaster  maintains  that  the  prosecutor committed misconduct by making a more detailed factual statement on the  record  at  sentencing  beyond  the  one  stated  at  the  plea  hearing.    Bowermaster  claims  that  the  prosecutor’s  statements  at  sentencing  were  inflammatory  and  improperly influenced the trial court in imposing a fifty-seven month prison term, contrary to the jointly recommended sentence of five years of community control and  ninety-days  local  jail  time.    Bowermaster  maintains  that  the  prosecutor’s  conduct deprived him of his right to due process of law.

Moreover, we find there is no evidence in the record that the trial  court  relied  on  the  prosecutor’s  statements  in  imposing  its  sentence. 

{¶11}Based on the foregoing, we conclude that Bowermaster has failed to demonstrate  the  prosecutor  committed  any  misconduct  or  that  the  trial  court’s  sentence was improper or otherwise unsupported by the record.

{¶ 37} THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN PERMITTING EXPERT TESTIMONY FROM THE SANE NURSE. 
{¶ 39} To support this claim, Jones argues that Spicer's testimony about the impact that gravity may have on semen, a liquid, was inadmissible because the state did not comply with Crim.R. 16(K). Pursuant to that rule, all expert witnesses are required to ""prepare a written report summarizing the expert witness's testimony, findings, analysis, conclusions, or opinion, and shall include a summary of the expert's qualifications."" Therefore, according
to Jones, because the state did not comply with Crim.R. 16(K), Spicer's testimony set forth above was inadmissible because it went ""beyond the scope"" of what was permissible expert
witness testimony.


{¶ 33} JONES'S CONVICTION MUST BE REVERSED AS A RESULT OF THE
PROSECUTOR'S INAPPROPRIATE USE OF HIS PRE-MIRANDA SILENCE
{¶ 34} In his third assignment of error, Jones argues his conviction must be reversed given the state's ""inappropriate"" use of his so-called ""pre-arrest, pre-Miranda silence"" when the state asked him ""why he didn't ask the police officers who conducted the search warrant on his property as to why they were present"" as part of the state's cross-examination. It is generally well-established that ""the use of a defendant's prearrest silence as substantive evidence of guilt violates the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination."" State v. Jozwiak, 12th Dist. Warren No. CA2019-09-091, 2020-Ohio-3694, ¶ 34. However, as the record indicates, the state's questioning Jones about his prearrest, pre-Miranda silence was not used as substantive evidence indicative of Jones' guilt. The state's questioning was instead used to impeach Jones' testimony that he was ""[k]ind of"" surprised when the police arrived at his home with a search warrant the day after the alleged rape occurred. Therefore, despite Jones' claim, the effect of the state's questioning Jones in this manner was proper given that it was for impeachment purposes only, and not to portray Jones' so- called prearrest, pre-Miranda silence as substantive evidence indicative of Jones' guilt.",No error,"Discovery: 
{¶ 40} However, despite Jones' claim, the record plainly reveals that Spicer did not testify as an expert witness under Evid.R. 702. The record instead firmly establishes that Spicer testified as a lay witness in accordance with Evid.R. 701.
{¶ 41} In so holding, we note that contrary to Jones' claim, it does not take any specialized knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education to understand that gravity could cause semen, a liquid, to roll down from a victim's vagina to a victim's rectum (or vice-versa), thereby necessitating swabs be taken from both areas of the alleged victim's body regardless of whether the allegation was one of vaginal rape or of anal rape. That gravity may cause a liquid, like semen, to move or be transferred from one part of the body to another is an observable fact that is a matter of common knowledge. See State v. Warren,
11th Dist. Trumbull No. 2010-T-0027, 2011-Ohio-4886, ¶ 53 (""[a]n average juror is aware that liquids, regardless of their viscosity, will move or transfer when subjected to a given force, such as gravity or friction. This is not a theory, but an observable fact common to everyone's experience""), discretionary appeal not allowed, 131 Ohio St.3d 1457, 2012-Ohio-648; see also Crane v. Brintnall, 29 Ohio Misc. 75, 84, 1972 Ohio Misc. LEXIS 204
(Jan. 6, 1972) (C.P.) (""the operation of the law of gravity and the fact that water will seek its lowest level is a matter of common knowledge""). Therefore, finding no merit to any of the arguments raised by Jones herein, Jones' fourth assignment of error lacks merit and is overruled.

Cross-examination:
Therefore, despite Jones' claim, the effect of the state's questioning Jones in this manner was proper given that it was for impeachment purposes only, and not to portray Jones' socalled prearrest, pre-Miranda silence as substantive evidence indicative of Jones' guilt. 
{¶ 35}  The Ohio Supreme Court has similarly held that ""pre-Miranda silence may be used for impeachment purposes if the defendant testifies at trial."" Such is the case here. 
To hold otherwise, thereby finding it was error for the state to question Jones about his prearrest, pre-Miranda silence as part of the state's cross-examination, ""would vitiate the truth-seeking process and otherwise insulate [Jones] from cross-examination, which is the test of credibility.""

DECLARE A MISTRIAL BASED UPON THE STATE’S FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE RULES OF DISCOVERY.”

{¶15} During the direct testimony of Ptl. Miller, as Miller testified to the chain of custody of the evidence seized from appellant, the prosecutor began to introduce a property submission form of the New Philadelphia Police Department labeled as appellee’s Exhibit I. Defense trial counsel objected, arguing the form was never provided in discovery despite numerous requests. Defense trial counsel stated “this,” i.e. the chain of custody delineated on the form, was the basis of appellant’s defense, and moved for a mistrial because the property submission form was not disclosed. 
Appellee responded that an incomplete property submission form had been in the prosecutor’s possession throughout the case and was disclosed to appellant in discovery. The trial court denied the motion for mistrial but excluded appellee’s Exhibit I as inadmissible.",Harmless error,"{¶25} Upon our review of the entire record, we conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellant’s motion for a mistrial. It is apparent that the trial court believed the prosecution's explanation for the delay in the disclosure of the evidence and found no willful discovery violation by appellee. 

Appellant has not established how possession of Exhibit I would have provided any additional foreknowledge that would have benefited preparation of his defense; the Chain of Custody form notates information available throughout the remainder of discovery. 
The evidence was seized, processed, submitted to BCI for testing, and returned. 

Finally, appellant has failed to establish any prejudicial effect arising from the discovery violation. Appellant’s argument at trial was, e.g., that Miller confused the two containers before they were submitted into evidence, or that BCI somehow contaminated the sample during testing. We therefore fail to discern how this discovery violation prejudiced appellant in the preparation of his defense. The trial court did exclude Exhibit I from admission at trial.",,Crim.R. 16,"Delaney, J.",Patricia A. Delaney,"Hoffman, P.J.

{¶24} In her second assignment of error, appellant contends the trial court erred in permitting Lieutenant Perkins to testify about the statement she made to him and the Harveysburg Police Chief in late September 2019 or early October 2019, wherein appellant admitted she had struck Thomas during the April 23, 2019 incident, as the state did not disclose the existence of this statement until the morning of trial.
 Appellant contends she did not have sufficient time to consult with counsel regarding the statement and that her due process rights were violated by the admission of the lately disclosed evidence.

----------

Examination of witnesses: 
{¶35} In her third assignment of error, appellant contends the trial court erred when it allowed the prosecutor to ask leading questions of Thomas, as doing so permitted the state to ""put words in the mouth of the victim."" Specifically, appellant takes issue with the following exchange between the prosecutor and Thomas, contending the prosecutor told Thomas to state that appellant hit him:",No error,"Discovery: 
{¶29} None of the three factors identified above apply in this case. Nothing in the record indicates that the state's failure to provide notice of appellant's oral statement to Lieutenant Perkins and the Harveysburg Police Chief was a willful discovery violation. Rather, the state indicated it had not learned of the statement until the morning of trial and, upon learning of appellant's statement, immediately disclosed the statement to defense counsel. Defense counsel recognized that the late disclosure was not willful, stating, ""there is no aspersion being made toward the state, things like last-minute evidence comes in.""
{¶31} Finally, the record does not show prejudice. Defense counsel was not surprised by the statement, counsel's trial strategy did not change, and counsel did not find it necessary to request a continuance to prepare to cross-examine Lieutenant Perkins about the second statement. Hence, ""'the trial court may have properly determined that appellant was prepared to proceed despite any claim of unfair surprise.'"" Id. at ¶ 119, quoting State v. Bidinost, 71 Ohio St.3d 449, 457 (1994).
{¶32} Given the record before us, we find no error in the admission of appellant's second statement to law enforcement. The trial court properly permitted Lieutenant Perkins' testimony as to this statement. Appellant's second assignment of error is, therefore, overruled.

------------

Examination of witnesses: {¶37} The record demonstrates that Thomas was in the midst of describing the
altercation that took place between him and appellant on April 23, 2019 when his response became somewhat inaudible. The prosecutor sought to clarify for the record Thomas' response by repeating what she believed she heard Thomas state and asking him if that
was correct: ""I just want to make sure we understand. You said, 'she hit you?'"" Merely repeating the answer that Thomas had already given in an effort to clarify a response for the record does not amount to asking an improper leading question.

trial. The State does not support this contention in any way and instead argues that, even assuming the song lyrics were discoverable, the trial court remedied the alleged discovery violation by allowing Mr. Singleton to respond the State’s allegation that he wrote the rap lyrics. We agree

In this case, Mr. Singleton did not request a continuance of the sentencing hearing. Mr. Singleton’s trial counsel objected to the use of the lyrics at sentencing and argued that he should be able to respond to the allegation that he composed the lyrics. A review of the transcript shows that the trial judge gave Mr. Singleton the opportunity to respond and specifically stated
that he was giving Mr. Singleton “some credit” for the prosecutor bringing the lyrics “up late” and not giving him “much of a chance to respond.” The trial court then imposed a sentence of six years rather than the maximum sentence of eight years as recommended by the prosecutor.
Moreover, Mr. Singleton has not argued, much less demonstrated, how he was prejudiced by the trial court’s decision to allow him to respond to the prosecutor’s allegation he wrote the lyrics and subsequently give him “some credit” for the prosecutor’s alleged discovery violation.",,Crim.R. 16,Schafer,Julie A.

",No error,"There is no proffer made or description of what evidence was purportedly withheld. It is not evident from the record that the closing argument referenced by appellant is not mere speculation that there is additional evidence not shared by the police, instead of an accusation that specific
evidence was withheld.

Appellant’s argument here speculates as to the existence of other evidence and the effect any such evidence would have had on the bindover proceeding. The argument is not supported by any documentary evidence to bolster what is purely speculation that the prosecution possessed material that was not provided to the defense during discovery.

Accordingly, we conclude that Green has preserved the issue for appeal.

{¶27} We are compelled to sustain Green’s assignment of error. The State correctly notes that a lay witness may offer opinions and inferences under Evid.R. 701 provided that the opinions are rationally based on their perception. See State v. Morgan, 9th Dist. Medina No. 07CA0124- M, 2008-Ohio-5530, ¶ 30. Here, however, Detective Garey’s opinion regarding how the bullet passed through Jackson’s body and shattered the window went well beyond inferences that were rationally based on his perceptions.

The expert testimony here built a bridge that spanned the gap from
the narrative presented by the State to the conclusion endorsed by Detective Garey. As this case turned largely on the credibility of Jackson and Green, Detective Garey’s testimony was highly prejudicial as it effectively corroborated Jackson’s version of events.

The prosecutor stated he would look into this and get back with Appellant. It appears from the record until this point in the proceedings, the State was unaware Appellant intended to claim he did not live in the residence where the drugs were found, and failure to disclose earlier Risser as a witness concerning where Appellant resided was not willful.

{¶17} As to whether foreknowledge of the undisclosed witness would have benefited Appellant in the preparation of a defense, the witness was not a direct fact witness as to the crimes, but merely was called to testify as to where Appellant lived. Further, the trial court ensured counsel would have an opportunity to interview the witness prior to his testimony at trial. When counsel cross-examined the witness at trial, counsel noted he had spoken to Risser the day prior to his testimony. Risser did not testify as to any of the details surrounding the charges, and his testimony was limited to an observation Appellant appeared to be living in the home on August 1, 2018, and he first began to see Appellant at the home in 2013, or 2014. We find Appellant had adequate notice of the State’s intention to call Risser to prepare a defense, particularly given the limited nature of Risser’s testimony.

{¶18} We also find Appellant was not prejudiced by the late disclosure of the witness. As discussed earlier, Appellant had an opportunity to interview the witness the day before he testified.",,Crim.R. 16,Hoffman,William B. Hoffman,"Gwin, P.

French,Walker,Jarmarko,Jarmarko Walker,Black,2017,Murder,murder,weapons under disability,,,,24 to life,,,"Discovery,Examination of witnesses","{¶ 83} Walker argues that defense counsel should have requested a mistrial when he learned that there was an interview of Jamarko McShann which was not provided to the defense, because he was “substantially prejudiced” by the State’s failure to disclose all discovery prior to trial. 

Walker also argues that the trial court erred in not declaring a mistrial when it knew he had not been provided all discovery before trial, in violation of his Brady rights. Further, Walker argues that defense counsel was ineffective in failing to object to a question from the State about whether the defense had asked “to have any piece of evidence tested scientifically at the lab?” because he had a constitutional right not to prove anything at trial. ",Harmless error,"{¶ 91} We cannot conclude that Walker has established a substantial violation of any of defense counsel's essential duties. The record reflects that defense counsel brought the absence of Jamarko McShann’s interview from discovery to the court’s attention as soon as he became aware of it. It appears from the record that Det. Daugherty did not deliberately withhold Jamarko McShann’s interview, but that it was an oversight, as the court and defense counsel acknowledged. In other words, there was no “gamesmanship” or intentional secreting of evidence favorable to the State. 

Defense counsel did not dispute the prosecutor’s assertion that Jamarko McShann did not provide an alibi for Walker on the night of the incident, and we cannot conclude that foreknowledge of the
undisclosed interview would have benefitted Walker, or that he was prejudiced by the State’s inadvertent failure to disclose it. In other words, ineffective assistance of counsel is not demonstrated.

------
{¶ 94} Finally, we turn to Walker’s assertion that defense counsel was ineffective in failing to object to the prosecutor’s question to Det. Daugherty on redirect examination regarding whether the defense ever requested to have any piece of evidence scientifically
tested. We conclude that the trial court correctly determined that defense counsel failed to timely object to the question, and that Walker waived all but plain error

{¶ 95} Plain error is not demonstrated. The question was an isolated one, and given the overwhelming evidence of Walker’s guilt (as discussed thoroughly below) we
cannot conclude that counsel’s failure to timely object to the question affected Walker’s substantial rights. Finally, the trial court instructed the jury that a defendant is presumed
innocent until his guilt is established beyond a reasonable doubt, and the defendant “must be acquitted unless the State produces evidence that convinces you beyond a reasonable
doubt of every essential element of the offenses charged in the indictment.” (Emphasis added). Ohio has consistently held that juries are presumed to follow the court's instructions. State v. Wood, 2d Dist. Clark No. 2016-CA-69, 2018-Ohio-875, ¶ 67.

Contrary to appellant's assertion, Corporal Stegall's testimony regarding the videotape was ambiguous.

However, when asked on cross-examination whether ""there is a camera that shows the inside of the drunk tank,"" the officer replied, ""Yes.""

continue the trial, rather than exclude the supplemented discovery from the state, was not unreasonable, unconscionable, or arbitrary because (1) the state did not willfully delay naming or disclosing witnesses Bridget Stump, Richard Scott, Pamela Keibler, or Donald Stiltner; and (2) even before the state’s disclosure, Appellant had some knowledge of what Scott knew regarding the murder and Appellant had Keibler and Stiltner on his “radar” and despite having the means to independently investigate these individuals, chose not to. 

Therefore, because the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Appellant’s motion to exclude the witnesses, but instead granted Appellant’s motion to continue the December 17, 2018 trial date, we overrule Appellant’s first assignment of error.",New trial,Crim.R. 16,Kristy S.

5/4/2023 GA - Switched to is error but reverses on other grounds based on the idea that they are saying it was a discovery violation but didn't reach prejudice

07/12/2023 - This is a tricky one. We decided that this case does not reach prejudice after re-reading. While there's a discussion of problems with discovery, we are concerned that it doesn't rise to the level of error. We decided to err on the side of caution and label it as not resulting in prejudice. We did not leave it as did not reach anything/reverses on other grounds because it seems like a more substantive discussion was had by the appellate court and also because the case was only remanded for a hearing that told the defendant the terms of his post-release control (didn't actually alter anything.)",,,,,Rachel E.

BERRY,White,2020,Murder,involuntary manslaughter,aggravated trafficking in drugs ,,,Female,17 years,,2020,Discovery,"{¶84} Berry argues that the trial court erred in denying the motion for a
mistrial that he made after the State was late in disclosing the agreement between the police and the confidential informant.

{¶86} In this case, defense counsel informed the trial court that the State had not disclosed the defendant’s agreement” between G.C., the confidential informant, and the Union County Prosecutor’s Office. 

---------",Harmless error,"{¶91} On appeal, Berry has not demonstrated how he was prejudiced by the late disclosure of a copy of the defendant’s agreement. The trial court gave the Defense an opportunity to review the relevant materials. Jan. 13 Vol. I Tr. 120-121.
The Defense ably and extensively cross-examined Deputy Wilson about the contents of this defendant’s agreement and G.C.’s violations of this agreement after the State had extensively questioned Deputy Wilson about the same matters. Jan. 13 Vol. II Tr. 7-13; Jan. 14 Vol. I Tr. 19-26, 89-90. Thus, the jury heard about the terms of the defendant’s agreement and G.C.’s dishonesty without hearing G.C.’s testimony about the four controlled buys in which he was a confidential informant. 

For these reasons, Berry has not demonstrated how his Defense was, in fact, prejudiced by the late disclosure of G.C.’s defendant’s agreement.

We disagree.",No error,"{¶ 44} Furthermore, there is nothing in the record that would indicate that a motion to suppress would have been successful. That is to say, there is no evidence that Derifield was not informed of his Miranda rights. The only discussion of that issue came upon Derifield's request for a mistrial when the state briefly mentioned that Detective Perkins had provided Derifield with his Miranda rights. To that end, the record does not reflect that the
state ""willfully failed"" to turn over any discovery item in violation of Crim.R. 16 or that the supposedly undisclosed item would have benefitted Derifield in his preparation. Finally, we note that Derifield's proximity to the drugs, including the fact that his wallet was kept in the same location as a portion of the drugs, minimizes any prejudicial effect of Derifield's statement admitting ownership of ""one of the bags of crack.""

Secondly: 

{¶ 42} At the close of the state's case, Derifield's counsel moved for a mistrial on the grounds that she was ""unaware that [Derifield] was in custody at the time that admission of ownership was made."" Derifield now argues that the trial court should have declared a mistrial because he was denied the opportunity to suppress his admission. Derifield maintains that the discovery provided by the state only includes a statement from Detective Perkins that he ""interviewed all parties at the scene along with Derifield."" Derifield takes issue with that statement and alleges that Detective Perkins' written statement amounts to a violation of Crim.R. 16 because it intentionally leads the reader to believe that he had a voluntary interview with the parties.

{¶ 43} However, after review, we find the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Derifield's motion for a mistrial. As an initial matter, we note that the state complied with its obligations under Crim.R.16(B)(1) in providing ""[a]ny written or recorded statement by the defendant * * *, including police summaries of such statements"" made by the defendant. Though Derifield characterizes Detective Perkins' statement as misleading, there is no requirement, and Derifield cites no authority, that the state is required to detail
the circumstances in which the statement was made. Rather, the record reflects that Derifield and his counsel should have been aware of the statement and the surrounding situation could have been discussed between attorney and client.

ground that he had been denied a fair trial by multiple instances of prosecutorial misconduct.

withheld evidence demonstrating that the police had “mishandled and/or tampered with [and] thereby alter[ed] the probative value of” the jeans shorts.

{¶20} But Long’s petition and its supporting evidentiary material, when
considered with the trial record, cannot be said to demonstrate that, but for the claimed constitutional violations, no reasonable fact finder would have found him guilty of Spikes’s murder.

 THE TRIAL COURT ERRED BY DENYING APPELLANT’S
MOTION TO DISMISS WITHOUT A HEARING ON THE EXPLANATION
FOR MISSING DASHCAM VIDEO. 

{¶87} Appellant argues that the tape only potentially contained useful evidence. As such, it is incumbent on appellant to show that the tape’s unavailability was the result of bad faith on the part of the state.

The first time appellant or his trial counsel learned of the existence of a videotape was on January 28, 2016, the date of appellant’s suppression hearing. At that hearing, Trooper Golias testified on cross-examination that there was in fact an audiotape or videotape of 
 appellant’s traffic stop. (Supp. Tr. 43). Said tape was not provided to the prosecutor’s office.

DELIBERATELY ADMITTING INADMISSIBLE HEARSAY EVIDENCE TO
THE JURY ONLY TO WITHDRAW THAT EVIDENCE ONCE
INADMISSIBLE HEARSAY TESTIMONY HAD BEEN ELICITED

{¶94} Appellant argues that, in two instances, the state committed prosecutorial misconduct by eliciting testimony concerning two proposed exhibits only to later withdraw those proposed exhibits. ",Did not reach anything/ reverses on other grounds,"{¶90} Appellant’s motion to dismiss alleged no specific facts about what was allegedly on the tape that was exculpatory in nature. Appellant’s brief in this appeal is also silent on what the tape may have contained that was potentially exculpatory. The only thing known for certain from the record is that a tape existed and was erased pursuant to the Ohio State Highway Patrol’s retention policy. 

Ultimately, because appellant makes no arguments concerning the contents of the tape and there is no evidence that the state acted in bad faith when it erased the tape, appellant failed to meet his burden that the tape would have had a reasonable probability to affect the outcome of his trial.
{¶92} Accordingly, appellant’s seventh assignment of error is without merit and is overruled.

Specifically, he asserts that counsel should have investigated whether “the favorable conclusion of the DNA report” (that Bendolph’s DNA was not found to be present on the victim) excluded the possibility that there was semen present in the vagina. ",Did not reach error/conduct did not result in prejudice,"{¶ 41} Moreover, although we recognize that the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution imposes upon the State a duty to disclose to a criminal defendant evidence that is favorable to him or her and is material either to guilt or to punishment, we cannot find that Bendolph was denied due process. 

{¶ 49} Even if we were to view the serology report as favorable or exculpatory, which we do not, the non-disclosure of this evidence did not necessarily implicate due process.

{¶ 52} Under these circumstances, where the undisclosed evidence was not known to the prosecution and was not necessarily favorable or unfavorable to the defendant and the trial court instructed the jury to disregard the one reference to it, where there was strong evidence of guilt, and where evidence of the absence of foreign DNA
was admitted, we cannot conclude that the surprise caused by the undisclosed report “significantly impair[ed] the fairness of the trial” and violated Bendolph’s rights under the due process clause and Brady.

Procedural history: 

Defense counsel stated that he had been assured by the State
that he had received all discovery material. He had called Dallaire to the stand basedon the DNA report, had talked with her briefly about the DNA report on the Friday before trial, and had “anticipated nothing else.”

{¶ 29} The State argued that it had asked the lab “to send over all the labs that they had in regards to this case,” and that the lab responded by emailing only the DNAreport. The prosecutor stated that Detective Conley had also been unaware that there
was a serology report separate from the DNA report.

In opposition, the state argues that this information is referred to in appellant’s August 19, 2016 telephone call from appellant to “Wayne.”

-----

{¶135} In his 18th assigned error, appellant argues that the state failed to provide a proper witness list in violation of Crim.R. 16(I) because, “the state listed an extraordinary number of
witnesses who were not called.” In opposition, the state indicates that the trial court requested a “comprehensive list” in order to probe any potential conflicts with jurors. In an abundance of caution and to avoid surprise to the defense, the state provided an expansive list. 
-----
XX. Prosecutorial Misconduct
{¶143} In the 20th assigned error, appellant asserts that the prosecuting attorney engaged in misconduct by displaying to the jury various statements in quotations, thereby suggesting that they were transcribed; disclosing 200 potential witnesses, while only calling 67; and keeping appellant’s mother from the courtroom by including her on its witness list",Harmless error,"{¶47} Our review of the record indicates that the trial court properly denied the motion for a mistrial. Although there was some dispute as to whether the state informed the defense
that “The Terminator” actually contacted Perkins, the record demonstrates that the contact was discussed in jail calls that were provided to the defense. Moreover, we do not find the testimony regarding the contact from “The Terminator” to undermine the outcome of the trial,

-----
{¶139} Likewise, in this case, the state was required to list all witnesses that it reasonably anticipated calling, and the record demonstrates that the court sought a “comprehensive list” in order to properly seat a jury. Yet the court endeavored to conduct the trial expeditiously, and also requested a shortened list. Moreover, there is no evidence that the state intentionally misled the defense by providing the large list. Additionally, we note that one individual who identified appellant in a photo array did not identify him in court and other witnesses stated that they did not wish to be involved in the prosecution. Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in connection with this issue. 

------
{¶145} In evaluating appellant’s 7th and 18th assigned errors, we have previously reviewed the claims concerning the exclusion of appellant’s mother from the courtroom under the separation order and the length of the state’s potential witness list. We have determined that no error occurred on either matter. Likewise, neither matter presents a claim of prosecutorial misconduct.

{¶146} With regard to the matter of the quotation marks, the record indicates that during the state’s closing argument, the court repeatedly cautioned the state from listing statements in quotation marks. The court’s caution was a clear directive that the state had to show that it was making an argument and not using direct quotations. In light of the trial court’s diligence in
addressing this issue and remedying it, we find that the use of quotation marks was harmless.

-----

Grounds for Relief 13 and 16
{¶87} Mr. Spaulding argued that the State failed to correct: (1) Nurse Trenkelbach’s testimony regarding when Mr. Griffin last received morphine prior to being shown the photo
arrays, which he claims was contradicted by Mr. Griffin’s medical records; and (2) Mr. Wilbur’s testimony regarding his drug usage at the time of the shootings, which was contradicted by his criminal history.


---------

Ground for Relief 19
{¶93} Mr. Spaulding argued that the State failed to disclose favorable, exculpatory evidence, specifically Mr. Griffin’s text messages, which showed he could have been shot as a result of his “dangerous lifestyle.” He claimed that “[i]t does not appear that the State turned these text messages over to trial counsel” as they were in the prosecutor’s files but not defense counsel’s files. He claimed the text messages showed that Mr. Griffin had an “extensive text message conversation” with someone a month before he was shot, in which the other person “appeared to be pleading for his life” while Mr. Griffin “was apparently threatening to kill” the person. 

{¶97} The trial court found that this argument was barred by the doctrine of res judicata. The court also agreed with the State that Mr. Spaulding did not present evidence dehors the record that counsel did not have access to Mr. Griffin’s text messages, nor did he demonstrate that he was prejudiced by the absence of the text messages at trial. 

----

Ground for Relief 26
{¶100} Mr. Spaulding argued prosecutorial misconduct because the State presented false and misleading evidence that was “beyond the bounds of science[,]” specifically the testimony of the BCI forensic scientist, Mr. Roberts, that it was his opinion that the four cartridges recovered
from the two crime scenes were fired by the same gun. Mr. Spaulding referred again to the report from Mr. Nixon, citing the NAS Report regarding toolmark uniqueness, and argued that “expert testimony that purports to determine definitively that a particular gun must have fired a
particular bullet is not currently supported by science.” 

{¶101} The trial court found that the argument was barred by the doctrine of res judicata. Moreover, the court found that Mr. Spaulding’s evidence dehors the record did not advance his argument that the prosecutor presented false ballistics evidence through a BCI analyst. 


------


Grounds for Relief 27 and 28
{¶103} Mr. Spaulding argued prosecutorial misconduct because the State elicited testimony from a BCI forensic scientist, Stacy Violi, that three swabs taken from Mr. Spaulding’s shoes were presumptively positive for blood and a partial DNA profile consistent with Mr. Spaulding was obtained from one of the swabs. The State then misrepresented this evidence in closing arguments to suggest that the blood of one of the victims was found on Mr.
Spaulding’s shoes. He further argued that the State elicited testimony from Lieutenant Phister which it “knew or should have known to be misleading or categorically false[,]” ",No error,"{¶85} The trial court found that any alleged errors in the prosecutor’s opening or closing statements were corrected by the jury instruction from the court that counsel’s arguments are not evidence and that the jury would judge the facts. Moreover, the court found that Mr. Spaulding’s
evidence dehors the record did not even marginally advance his prosecutorial misconduct claim and the issue was barred by the doctrine of res judicata.
{¶86} We conclude that the trial court’s findings are supported by competent and credible evidence. As opening and closing statements are a part of the record, Mr. Spaulding’s claims could have been made on direct appeal without resorting to evidence dehors the record and are now barred by the doctrine of res judicata. Nevertheless, the trial court properly instructed the jury that opening and closing statements are not evidence, but merely intended to
assist the jury in evaluating the evidence.
-------

y. Thus, regardless of our disagreement with the trial court’s reliance on
res judicata here, we agree with the trial court that Mr. Spaulding has failed to demonstrate how Mr. Wilbur’s testimony was false or contradictory, or that the prosecutor knew it to be false. {¶92} We cannot say that the prosecutor’s conduct was improper or that Mr. Spaulding was deprived of his right to a fair trial. We therefore conclude that the trial court did not err or
abuse its discretion in denying these grounds for relief without a hearing. 

----

{¶98} We conclude that some of the trial court’s findings are supported by competent and credible evidence. Mr. Spaulding concedes that this evidence was in the prosecutor’s files, which contradicts his speculative claim that the evidence was not provided to, or was somehow withheld from, defense counsel by the prosecutor. Summit County maintains an “open-file
discovery” policy whereby “[d]efense counsel must * * * review the [p]rosecutor’s file for pertinent evidence and factual determinations as to the truth of the charge * * *.”

Mr. Spaulding has failed to provide any evidence dehors the record to show how these text messages, which were in existence and available for defense counsel to review at or before trial, were withheld by the State or somehow not provided to defense counsel. Mr. Spaulding has also failed to demonstrate how he has been prejudiced and failed to establish a reasonable probability that the outcome of his trial would have been different. 

{¶99} While we once again disagree with the trial court’s determination that res judicata applies here, Mr. Spaulding has failed to show any improper conduct by the prosecutor or any resulting prejudice. We therefore conclude that the trial court did not err or abuse its discretion in denying this ground for relief without a hearing.

-----

{¶102} Although we disagree with the trial court’s determination that this claim is barred by res judicata, we conclude that some of the trial court’s findings are supported by competent and credible evidence. Mr. Roberts testified at trial that in his opinion, based on a reasonable degree of scientific certainty, the four cartridges “were fired from one firearm” and his findings
were documented in his report. The prosecutor asked, “[I]s that your opinion 100 percent without question?” and Mr. Roberts said, “Correct.” The NAS Report does not fully support Mr. Spaulding’s claims that Mr. Roberts’ testimony was “beyond the bounds of science” or “not currently supported by science.” 

Thus, we conclude that the NAS Report does not establish that the prosecutor presented “false and misleading” ballistics testimony through Mr. Roberts’ testimony. Accordingly, we cannot say that the prosecutor’s conduct was improper or that Mr. Spaulding was deprived of his right to a fair trial. We conclude that the trial court did not err or abuse its discretion in denying this ground for relief without a hearing

-----

In her closing arguments, the prosecutor stated:
[W]e do have blood on his shoes. Now, you all saw that booking video[...]We know he’s been sitting in the jail watching CSI so I can assume he’s watching it at home, but he missed some spots, because there is blood on his shoes.

Nowhere in this statement does the prosecutor “misrepresent[] the evidence [and argue that] the blood belonged to one of the victims[,]” as Mr. Spaulding has argued. Ms. Violi’s DNA report was entered into evidence at trial and Mr. Spaulding failed to submit any evidence dehors the record in support of his argument. As the report, Ms. Violi’s testimony, and closing arguments
were all in the record, Mr. Spaulding’s argument could have been raised on direct appeal and is now barred by the doctrine of res judicata. 

{¶108} We cannot conclude that the prosecutor’s questioning of these witnesses was improper. We also cannot conclude that the prosecutor’s comments during closing arguments were improper.

fundamentally fair jury trial under the Fifth, Sixth and
Fourteenth Amendments to the US Constitution due to
improper closing remarks by the prosecutor: A) falsely
representing to the jury that the home security video recording
equipment was motion activated, B) expanding the scope of the
corrupt activity count beyond the predicate acts listed in the
indictment, and C) urging the jury to consider the erroneously
admitted anti-""snitch"" tattoo photographs for a forbidden
purpose. 

{¶ 58} Walker next argues the state deprived him of a fair trial when, during its
rebuttal argument, the prosecutor commented that as of March 29, 2016, the drug house had all of the items it would need to engage in a pattern of corrupt activity and that it was ""an ongoing place of business."" 

{¶ 59} Lastly under this assignment of error, Walker argues the state deprived him of a fair trial when the prosecutor, in commenting on the lack of civilian witnesses in the case, argued that Brandon's ""Death B4 Dishonor, Stop Snitchin"" tattoo helps explain why no civilian witnesses would be willing to come forward or cooperate

-------------

[6.] The prosecutor's peremptory strike of an African-American
juror on account of her race violated Walker's rights under the
equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the
United States Constitution. 
------------

[8.] The trial court's denial of Walker's motion to disclose
information regarding the confidential informant violated
Brady and deprived him of his right to due process and a
fundamentally fair jury trial under the Fifth, Sixth, and
Fourteenth Amendments to the US Constitution. ",No error,"{¶ 53} Courts afford prosecutors wide latitude in closing arguments, and
prosecutors may draw reasonable inferences from the evidence at trial, commenting on those inferences during closing argument. {¶ 56} The state argues that the prosecutor's statement that the cameras were
motion activated was a fair characterization of Detective Gauthney's testimony on this matter. Having reviewed the record, we agree. 

{¶ 57} Even if the prosecutor was technically incorrect about whether the cameras were motion activated, the point that he was making was consistent with the testimony. Moreover, defense counsel objected to this statement at trial and the trial court instructed the jurors to rely on their own memories of what the evidence showed. Thus, Walker does not demonstrate that this characterization of the evidence during closing arguments prejudiced him or deprived him of a fair trial.

Having determined in our resolution of Walker's first assignment of
error that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction of engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity, this argument is moot and we need not address it.

{¶ 60} As we have noted throughout our analysis, however, the evidence of these crimes was based entirely on the surveillance video confiscated from the house. Even without civilian witnesses to corroborate the events in the video, there was ample evidence of Walker's guilt. Thus, the prosecutor's remarks about Brandon's tattoo and the lack of civilian witnesses could not have operated to deprive Walker of a fair trial.

{¶ 61} Because Walker does not show that the state deprived him of a fair trial when the prosecutor commented on the motion activated nature of the surveillance footage or when the prosecutor commented on Brandon's tattoo, and because Walker's argument about the evidence related to the engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity charge is moot, Walker's fourth assignment of error is overruled in part and moot in part.

----------------

{¶ 76} The state's reason for exercising a peremptory challenge was that her father had a federal criminal conviction. The criminal history of a relative of a potential juror is a race-neutral explanation for a peremptory strike. The trial court was able to consider the validity of the state's response and determined there was no discriminatory intent.
Accordingly, the trial court did not clearly err when it determined the state had credible, race-neutral reasons for exercising its peremptory strike. We overrule Walker's sixth assignment of error. 

-----------

{¶ 90} Here, the identity of the confidential informant was not material or necessary for Walker's defense. The informant's role was contained to Detective Gauthney's surveillance of the house and his decision to seek a search warrant for the property. All of the charges in the indictment related to March 29, 2016, a day on which the parties agree the confidential informant was not present and provided no additional information to the police. 

Further, all of the evidence at trial related to the indicted offenses was from the surveillance footage and unrelated to the role of the confidential informant. Walker does not explain how knowing the identity of the informant would have aided in his defense to those charges.
{¶ 91} Thus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Walker's motion to compel disclosure of the confidential informant, and the state did not violate Walker's rights under Brady by not disclosing the informant's identity.

[59] {¶ 242} In his opening statement, the prosecutor said Mary had removed Tench as a beneficiary from her annuity with one insurance company and had had contact with another insurance company for the same purpose. The state did not support these claims with any evidence at trial.

Examination:
Tench also contends that it was misconduct for the state to
elicit Kyker’s testimony about deletions from her Facebook account and cell phone. But the trial court overruled a defensemobjection to this testimony. 

OTHER PRIOR ACTS- harmless

[33] {¶ 156} Explaining police actions can be a valid basis for introducing otheracts evidence. See State v. Crawley, 633 N.W.2d 802, 806 (Iowa 2001). And in thiscase, the prosecution had reason to explain
why the detectives focused on Tench. Defense counsel had said in opening statement that ‘‘it was easy for the * * * police
to focus on’’ Tench and counsel accused the
police of having had ‘‘tunnel vision.’’
{¶ 157} But if the robbery was introduced to explain why the police focused on Tench as a suspect in the murder case, the
state was using it for precisely the purpose forbidden by Evid.R. 404(B): as propensity evidence. Why would Tench’s being suspected of armed robbery make him the prime suspect in his mother’s disappearance, unless the robbery shows that he has a propensity either for violent crime or for crime in general? Weinhardt and Schmitt, in their trial testimony, never suggested any non character reason why Tench’s suspected role in the robbery caused them to believe he was involved in Mary’s disappearance. Nor does the state’s brief offer any such explanation. Hence, the ‘‘early focus on Tench’’ explanation fails the second part of the Williams test—the evidence was presented to prove Tench’s
character and that he acted in conformity with that character—and is not an acceptable basis for admitting the robbery evidence.
{¶ 159} We conclude that admitting the Old-Carolina-Barbecue-robbery evidence constituted an abuse of discretion 

",Did not reach error/conduct did not result in prejudice,"Opening - did not reach error
The state argues that this was not misconduct, because the record does not demonstrate bad faith. But what matters ‘is the fairness of the trial, not the culpability of the prosecutor.’’ Thus, the question is whether the error ‘‘made [Tench’s] trial so fundamentally unfair as to deny him due process.’’ Donnelly v. DeChristoforo, 416 U.S. 637, 645, 94 S.Ct. 1868, 40 L.Ed.2d 431 (1974). Here it did not.  The discussion of this subject was brief and not particularly ‘‘important to the prosecution’s case in chief.’’ Id. at 647, 94 S.Ct. 1868.



Examination (no error):
Prosecutor did not commit misconduct
by eliciting testimony of defendant’s girlfriend regarding deletions from her cell phone and social media account, in prosecution for aggravated murder of defendant’s mother, where, although the testimony was improperly admitted, the trial court overruled defendant’s objection to it.
As we discussed above, the trial court erred by allowing the testimony. Nevertheless, ‘‘it is not prosecutorial misconduct to introduce
evidence that the trial court has determined to be admissible.’

other- no error

[41, 42] {¶ 177} ‘‘Error in the admission of other act testimony is harmless
when there is no reasonable possibility that the testimony contributed to the accused’s S117conviction.’’ State v. Lytle, 48 Ohio St.2d 391, 358 N.E.2d 623 (1976), paragraph three of the syllabus, vacated in
part on other grounds, 438 U.S. 910, 98 S.Ct. 3135, 57 L.Ed.2d 1154 (1978). ‘‘[A]n improper evidentiary admission under
Evid.R. 404(B) may be deemed harmless error on review when, after the tainted evidence is removed, the remaining evidence is overwhelming.’’ State v. Morris, 141 Ohio St.3d 399, 2014-Ohio-5052, 24
N.E.3d 1153, ¶ 32. [43] {¶ 178} In this case, the properly
admitted evidence of Tench’s guilt is overwhelming. 

Discovery - no error

{¶ 226} This appears to be a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel—although Tench does not cite or discuss the standard governing ineffective-assistance claims—and also a claim that discovery
was improperly withheld. Neither claim is factually supported: Tench cites nothing in the record to show that defense counsel was not provided with the video",,,DeGenaro,Mary DeGenaro,"O’Connor, C.J., and O’Donnell, French,

Elicited inadmissible and inflammatory opinion testimony from E.N,
K.W.’s grandmother; 2. Stated in closing that appellant “doesn't want to talk to the police unless he has his lawyer here”; 3. Referred to appellant’s text message as “disgusting, vile and grotesque”; 4. Commented that Defense counsel “hasn’t had the privilege of raising a
teenager.”",Did not reach error/conduct did not result in prejudice,"1. {¶30} K.W.’s grandmother, E.N., delayed several weeks before she notified the Morrow County Sheriff’s Office of the allegations of sexual assault of her granddaughter and later permitted her granddaughter to return to live with the appellant. The prosecutor’s questions provided an opportunity for E.N. to explain that delay and her rationale for
exposing her granddaughter to risk of further abuse. When asked for her opinion of appellant, she stated “I cannot stand to look at him.” This comment was merely a summation of her prior testimony where she made it clear that she had a negative opinion of appellant. While these statements are of arguable persuasiveness, we cannot state that their admission rises to the level of plain error. 
2. {¶34} Appellant’s desire to have his attorney present during his statement was introduced during trial without objection, and the prosecutor was free to comment upon such evidence. State v. Elliott, 91 Ohio App.3d 763, 773, 633 N.E.2d 1144 (3rd Dist.1993). The prosecutor was recounting the testimony already heard by the jury. State v. Scott, 6th Dist. Lucas No. L-01-1337, 2003-Ohio-1402, ¶ 19, on reconsideration, 6th Dist. Lucas No. L-01-13372003-Ohio-1868, ¶ 19. “Both the prosecution and the defense have wide latitude in summation as to what the evidence has shown and what reasonable inferences may be drawn therefrom.” State v. Stephens, 24 Ohio St.2d 76, 82, 53 O.O.2d 182, 263 N.E.2d 773 (1970), State v. Lott, 51 Ohio St.3d 160, 165, 555 N.E.2d 293 (1990). The prosecutor’s comments were well within the boundaries of commentary on the evidence and therefore we do not find that the failure to exclude the prosecutor’s comment was plain error creating a miscarriage of justice. 
3. {¶35} Appellant next complains of the prosecutor’s characterization of his text message as “vile, disgusting and grotesque.” First, we do not believe this is an unreasonable characterization of that message, but more importantly, the prosecutor used this description to highlight the emotional forcefulness of the statement in the context of the element of force in the charge of rape, contending that this statement is powerful and an attempt to assert control over the victim. As noted above, the parties “have wide latitude in summation as to what the evidence has shown and what reasonable inferences may be drawn therefrom.” Stephens, supra. This comment in the context of the argument that the appellant committed multiple sexual offenses against his step-daughter over a  Morrow County, Case No. 17CA0008 13
period of years is not unfairly prejudicial and we cannot agree that it created manifest injustice that warrants a new trial. 
4. {¶36} The prosecutor’s comment regarding the defense attorney’s lack of experience raising teenagers might be of questionable relevance, but it is likely of little consequence in this case. It was a brief, fleeting, comment that was not dwelt upon by the prosecutor and, as we noted above, counsel is given wide latitude in summation. We
cannot conclude this statement had any impact on the outcome of the case or affected the substantial rights of appellant. State v. Barnes, 94 Ohio St.3d 21, 27, 2002-Ohio-68, 759 N.E.2d 1240.

(37) After considering all of appellant's claims of prosecutorial misconduct, in light of the entire record in this case, we believe it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that, even absent the prosecutor's comments made during closing argument and the comments of E.N., the jury would still have found appellant guilty of these offenses.",,"Brady v.

{¶20} Smith first submits that the prosecutor violated the rules of discovery when the state failed to produce a copy of the 1986 police file referenced by Detective Johnson. But we are unable to determine what information was contained in that file, so we cannot say that the state was obligated to produce it in discovery. While Smith argues that the file could have contained police reports, witness statements, and medical records, there is nothing in the record to support that supposition. 

exa. witnesses
------
{¶22} Smith also claims that the state engaged in misconduct when it “failed to correct false testimony in the second trial.”
Smith has not established that the second version of M.S.’s testimony was false, just that it could be read as inconsistent with her first statement. That is insufficient to establish that the state engaged in misconduct when presenting and relying upon the testimony.

summation
-------
{¶25} Finally, Smith argues that statements made by the prosecutor during closing arguments were improper. 

(30) Smith next cites comments that the prosecutor made relating to a delay between when the incident was first investigated and when the prosecution commenced. Smith’s counsel had cited the delay as evidence of sloppy police work during defense’s closing argument. In rebuttal, the prosecutor discussed the delay, saying that",Harmless error,"discovery -no prejudice

The detective was not questioned about the details of the contents, Smith did not ask that the file be presented to the trial court for review, and Smith did not ask that the file be preserved in the record for this court to review. Smith never made a formal discovery request for the file. 

summation -harmless
----------

{¶29} In light of the context of the argument of counsel, we conclude that the statements made by the prosecutor were ill-advised but did not rise to the level of plain error. The prosecutor was making the point that the failure of a jury to convict is not the same as establishing that the underlying events did not occur. 

{¶31} The difference between this example and the previous one is that this statement by the prosecutor injects a specific series of events into the timeline of the case that was not presented to the jury in the form of admissible evidence. The specific facts surrounding any preindictment delay were not testified to. The prosecutor asked the jury to accept as true statements about the course of events that had no direct or inferential support from the evidence that had been submitted. This was improper.
{¶32} But establishing that a remark was improper is insufficient to establish that the convictions must be reversed. Smith must also establish prejudice. This isolated comment, about an auxiliary issue to the core issues in the case, was insufficient to rise to a level where we question the fairness of the trial. So, while the comments were improper, Smith was not prejudiced by them.",,prosecutorial misconduct,Mock,Russell Mock,MILLER and DETERS,"Charles M. Miller,Dennis Deters",Joseph T. Deters,Joseph T.

She also complains that the state improperly referenced facts not in evidence and vouched for the credibility of its witnesses

{¶25} Sanders’s next argument references testimony by the victim’s girlfriend that she saw a text message from the mother’s fiancé stating that “I know what happened that night.” This text message came to light during trial, and, after the girlfriend had testified for the state,
Sanders recalled the girlfriend as a witness. During Sanders’s closing argument, defense counsel referenced the girlfriend’s testimony and questioned why she had not been contacted by police detectives until the eve of trial.",Did not reach error/conduct did not result in prejudice,"By charactering the girlfriend’s belief that Sanders was in the car as “honest,” the state arguably expressed an opinion on her credibility. Nevertheless, the court sustained Sanders’s objection and later instructed the jury that closing arguments were not evidence and that the jury should not speculate on why the court sustained any objection. This limited the potential for prejudice from any misconduct.

{¶27} In a different part of its closing argument, the state noted that Sanders’s attempt to intimidate the witnesses did not stop those witnesses from coming to court and “telling you the truth.” Sanders did not object to this statement, so she forfeited all but plain error. Dean at ¶237. Unlike the state’s statement that the girlfriend was “honest,” the statement that the witnesses came to court for the purpose of “telling you the truth” did not vouch for the credibility of any specific statement.

The issues before this court are . . .  whether a prosecutor commits prosecutorial misconduct by placing a gun against his forehead during closing argument to demonstrate an issue at trial

{¶49} Burry’s second argument under the first assignment of error is that the trial court, while preventing “his expert witness from testifying regarding the results of a test that was key to his defense,” nevertheless permitted “the prosecut[ing] attorney to essentially testify and conduct a presentation similar to the one the trial court barred his expert witness from presenting.” Appellant’s brief at 15.

JURY SELECTION:

{¶56} Burry also claims the prosecutor improperly held himself out as an expert by explaining that he had firearms experience from his time in the Marine Corps and that one of the reasons he was brought on the case was because of his “expertise” in handling firearms. Appellant’s brief at 13. 

SUMMATION 2:

{¶58} Burry’s final argument under this assignment of error is that the prosecutor improperly claimed “that the defense expert was ‘tricking’ the jury.” Appellant’s brief at 14. The prosecutor was referring to Kapelsohn’s demonstration of how the Beretta would not be able to release its hammer (have a “dead trigger”) if it was put a quarter inch or more out of battery. On cross examination, the prosecutor had Kapelsohn admit that in order to achieve this result it was necessary for him to tilt his hand and apply pressure to the top portion of the slide to allow it to move independently of the barrel. If the Beretta is pushed against the hand or other hard surface perpendicularly so that the slide and barrel moved in unison, the slide would not be able to be pushed so far out of battery as to disengage the hammer. In other words, when Kapelsohn performed the demonstration he pushed the Beretta against his hand at an angle and this affected the result. ",No error,"SUMMATION 1:

{¶52} Contrary to Burry’s position, we find that the prosecutor’s demonstration was not improper. There is no indication in the record that the demonstration was intended to be testimonial, i.e., by pressing the pistol against his forehead, the prosecutor was trying to convince rather than prove to the jury that the pistol could be put out of battery without leaving a mark. The demonstration was theatrical rather than evidentiary and the prosecutor anticipated that the jury would draw its own conclusions on the issue based on its own handling of the evidence.

JURY SELECTION:

{¶57} The context of these comments readily demonstrates that the prosecutor was not holding himself out before the jury as an expert witness. Both comments occurred during the voir dire of the jury. In one instance, the prosecutor responded to a juror’s statement that his experience and knowledge came from the “U.S. Army” with “that’s my same experience in the Marine Corps.” In the other instance, the prosecutor mentioned his “expertise” to assure the jury that “we would handle this firearm [the Beretta] safely” and that “we’re going to follow the safety things that everyone * * * is taught from the get go.”4

SUMMATION 2:

{¶60} The prosecutor’s characterization of Kapelsohn’s demonstration as a trick is within the permissible bounds for closing argument. This court has observed that “[t]here is no requirement that a prosecutor’s language must be neutral in its characterizations of the evidence or defense strategy.” State v. Novak, 11th Dist. Lake No. 2003-L-077, 2005-Ohio-563, ¶ 42 (the prosecutor described the defense strategy as

Bolware attack statements made by the prosecutor during the course of the trial. After each statement, defense counsel had objected and requested a mistrial

Bolware groups the first two instances together as attempts by the
prosecutor to improperly refer to his criminal history. The first instance occurred during voir dire when the prosecutor said, “You are not allowed to know things about the defendant. You are not allowed to know what if any criminal history the defendant has. You are not allowed to know information that may be obtained through investigative sources to determine the defendant’s background

attempts to denigrate defense counsel during rebuttal closing argument

Davis,Black,2017,Drugs,possession of drugs (four counts),"illegal manufacturing of drugs, having a weapon while under disability",,,,28.5 years,,2017,Discovery,"{¶93} In Appellant’s fifth assignment of error, Appellant argues that the trial court was required to exclude Identification Officer Michael Carman’s (“Carman”) expert testimony, because the State did not comply with Crim.R. 16(K). For the reasons that follow, we find that the trial court did not err in allowing the State’s expert witness to testify. ",Harmless error,"{¶96} Initially, we note that the State concedes that they should have
provided Appellant with an expert report prior to Appellant’s jury trial, pursuant to Crim. R. 16(K). We also note that the Appellant does not allege that the exclusion of Carman’s testimony would have changed the outcome of the trial. Rather, Appellant argues that Carman’s testimony was “very important” to the State’s case and its inclusion (over objection) warrants him a new trial. 

{¶98} Relying on Opp, we find that the trial court did not err in allowing the State to present Carman’s limited expert testimony at trial. Specifically, the record reveals that Carman was not testifying on the specifics of the case at hand, but rather, provided testimony regarding his experience, in general, involving why fingerprints may or may not exist on a handgun. (Trial, 08/02/2018 Tr., Vol. I, at 209). Moreover, the trial court specifically found that Carman was not testifying about the evidence in Appellant’s case, but merely on generalities involving a lack of fingerprints on a handgun. (Id.). Accordingly, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by overruling Appellant’s Crim.R. 16(K) objection.

{¶99} Lastly, even if we were to find that the trial court erred in admitting
Carman’s testimony, we would affirm the ruling under the harmless error doctrine. Harmless error is “‘any error, defect, irregularity, or variance, which does not affect [a] substantial right[] [***]’”. State v. Wilson, 3rd Dist. Allen No. 1-09-53, 2010- Ohio-2947, ¶ 26 quoting Crim.R. 52(A). Furthermore, “harmless error does not affect the outcome of the case and, thus, does not warrant a judgment to be overturned or set aside.” Id.

{¶100} For the reasons discussed above, we overrule Appellant’s fifth
assignment of error. ",,"harmless error,Crim.R. 16",Zimmerman,William R. Zimmerman,"Willamowski, Preston","John R. Willamowski,Vernon L. Preston",Jana Emerick,Jana E.

Then in October, Davis filed a motion for reconsideration, which the court refused. He then appealed that to the Ohio Supreme Court. Jurisdiction was again declined. There was one additional appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court in 2022. It appears to be another motion for reconsideration. 

In March 2020, Davis filed a habeas petition in the Ohio Northern District. The assignments of error were largely based on the previous appeals. Return of writ had transcripts that identified the trial prosecutors. In December 2022, the magistrate recommended the petition be dismissed. In terms of PM, they did not find the appellate court incorrectly addressed the discovery violation and affirmed it wouldn't have impacted the outcome of the trial.

In one of the instances identified by Norales, the assistant prosecutor asked Trooper Malone if she is “a forensic analyst with respect to fingerprints” or DNA.

Similarly, the assistant prosecutor asked Trooper Martin whether he was
aware that “the rental agreement [for the Hyundai] said that there was no mileage charges[.]”

Finally, the assistant prosecutor repeatedly asked Norales why he was
searching for work across the country instead of in Washington.

CLOSING + DENIGRATING COUNSEL

{¶ 38} That pornographic images were found on Norales’s phone was not relevant to any issue in this case. We agree with Norales that there was no legitimate reason for raising this issue at trial—either on cross-examination or in closing—and that the assistant prosecutor acted improperly by doing so.",Harmless error,"To establish prosecutorial misconduct, a defendant must show that the
prosecutor’s conduct was improper and prejudicially affected the defendant’s substantial rights.

“A leading question is one that suggests to the witness the answer desired by the examiner.” (Citations and quotations omitted.) State v. Thompson, 141 Ohio St.3d 254, 2014-Ohio-4751, 23 N.E.3d 1096, ¶ 166. Generally, this type of question should not be used on direct examination except to develop the witness’s testimony. Evid.R. 611(C). “[A] prosecutor commits prosecutorial misconduct when leading questions pervade the entire trial in the face of a sustained objection.”


Certainly there were several times that the assistant prosecutor asked
leading or otherwise improper questions, and trial counsel failed to object. But upon our review of the record in its entirety, we would not characterize these improper questions as “pervasive.”

We also find that the questions were not so pervasive as to constitute reversible prosecutorial misconduct

CLOSING - also harmless

{¶ 39} We also agree with Norales that the assistant prosecutor acted improperly when he asked Norales if he was Christian and then mocked him during closing argument, sarcastically referring to him as “this good Christian.” See State v. Rahman,
23 Ohio St.3d 146, 153, 492 N.E.2d 401 (1986) (“[A]ppeals to racial or religious prejudices are improper conduct on the part of a prosecutor and may exert such a substantial influence on the result at trial that reversal is required.”); State v. Gilbert, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2010-09-240, 2011-Ohio-4340, ¶ 58.

{¶ 42} In this case, not only is the inference that Thomas was showing T.K. child
pornography reasonable, but it is unlikely that the outcome of the trial would have been
different had the State not verbalized the inference during its closing argument. In other
words, based on the evidence elicited at trial, it is likely the jury would have made the

inference on its own, and even without the inference, T.K.’s testimony was still sufficient
for the jury to find Thomas guilty. We therefore find no plain error",Did not reach error/conduct did not result in prejudice,"Although the prosecutor confused the facts of these two incidents during its

Vicario requested the appellate court reopen the appeal, which the appeals court denied in March of 2019. He then appealed a second time to the Ohio Supreme Court. The court again declined jurisdiction in June 2019. 

Vicario also has two federal cases. He filed the first one before his trial even started (1:16-cv-02911-CAB.) He appeared to allege that his arrest was illegal, that the charges should be dismissed with prejudice, and that his defense attorney wasn't sharing copies of discovery with him.

Bowen appealed this appellate decision to the Ohio Supreme Court in November 2018. The court declined jurisdiction in February of the following year. In April 2020, Bowen filed a pro se habeas petition. That petition re-upped the original Batson claim as well as additional claims of conflicts of interest by two other jurors. He also claimed rule 16 violations. In December 2020, a magistrate recommended the petition be dismissed. Specifically, the report found Bowen failed to demonstrate intent to discriminate on the Batson claim. The court noted that Bowen procedurally defaulted on many other claims, including the claim of juror conflict of interest and the rule 16 violations.

activity in violation of R.C. 2923.32(A)(1)",,,,32 years,,2016,"Examination of witnesses,Discovery","{¶74} In his third assignment of error raised by appellate counsel, Appellant contends his right to a fair trial and due process was violated. He raises four arguments under this assignment of error claiming as follows: 1) the trial court erred when it failed to declare a mistrial when Appellant’s presumption of innocence was eroded when multiple jurors saw him in his orange jail jumpsuit; 2) the trial court erred when it failed to declare a mistrial when the prosecutor elicited improper testimony in direct contravention to the trial court’s ruling regarding Appellant’s motion in limine to limit testimony regarding his ownership of cattle; 3) the trial court erred when it failed to declare a mistrial when testimony revealed that there were likely photographs related to the controlled buys that were not turned over during discovery; and 4) the errors in the trial resulted in cumulative error. The State contends the trial court did not err or abuse its discretion in denying Appellant’s various motions for mistrial, and argues that the errors alleged did not amount to cumulative error. 

DISCOVERY:

{¶80} Appellant also contends the trial court erred in denying his
motion for a mistrial that was made after it became apparent during trial that there may have been some photographs related to the controlled buys that formed the basis of the multiple trafficking in heroin counts. Appellant argues that Task Force Director William Gilkey, Detective Justin Rice, and Detective William Stewart all testified that it is standard procedure when executing controlled drug buys to photograph the money used and the contraband purchased. Appellant further notes that Director Gilkey testified that photos were taken for each of the controlled buys and that everything in the file was turned over to the prosecutor. The record bears out this testimony. However, the only photos provided by the State as part of discovery related to a single controlled buy involving Amber Duffy on April 8, 2014. Thus, Appellant moved for a mistrial based upon the grounds that all discoverable information was not disclosed to the defense as required. Appellant argues that despite the State's argument it turned over all of the photos it had, it was subject to a standard of due diligence under Crim.R. 16(A). 

WITNESS EXAMINATION:

{¶86} Appellant also contends the trial court erred in denying his motion for a mistrial that was made after the prosecution elicited testimony from one its witnesses indicating Appellant owned cattle, despite a previous
motion in limine being filed on that very subject and an alleged understanding by the parties that the order had been granted. The State does not dispute that it was agreed there was to be no mention of Appellant's ownership of cattle, however, it argues that the brief question and answer was not intentional, and that Appellant was not prejudiced or denied a fair trial by this brief reference to the ownership of cattle. As such, the State argues that the prosecutor's conduct did not rise to the level of prosecutorial misconduct.",Harmless error,"DISCOVERY:

{¶81} The State concedes the testimony, but states that ""either the
photographs were not provided to the prosecution, or the prosecution did not provided [sic] those photographs to Appellant for some unknown reason."" However, the State notes that it did not attempt to introduce those photographs into evidence at trial. The State further argues that photographs related to evidence of controlled buys would not have been material to the preparation of a defense, but would rather serve to implicate Appellant. Nonetheless, the State concedes that ""if such photographs existed,"" they should have been provided to Appellant. There is no evidence in the record before us that the missing photos were ever actually located after they were discovered to be missing. 

{¶84} Here, there is no evidence in the record that this discovery violation was willful on the part of the State. In fact, when it was discovered there were missing photos, it seemed just as much a surprise to the State as it
was to the defense. Although the State did have a duty of due diligence and arguably should have realized there were photos taken that were not
provided to them, there is no evidence the violation was willful. Further, the value of the missing photos in terms of the preparation of the defense is doubtful, and as argued by the State, likely would have further implicated Appellant rather than exculpated him. 

Finally, we cannot say that Appellant was prejudiced by the violation. Upon realizing there were photos taken that were not provided to the defense and that were unable to be located by the State, the trial court offered to give a curative instruction to the jury regarding the photos. However, defense counsel declined based upon a theory that do so would serve to explain or justify the State's conduct, which might be more damaging.

{¶85} Based upon our consideration of the foregoing factors as
applied to the facts presently before us, we cannot conclude that the trial
court's handling of the discovery violation was unreasonable, arbitrary, or
unconscionable. Thus, we cannot conclude that the trial court abused its
discretion in denying the motion for mistrial based upon this ground. 

WITNESS EXAMINATION:

{¶88} A review of the trial transcript reveals that the prosecutor did
in fact ask a question of its witness that was likely to elicit a response
indicating Appellant owned cattle. Thus, we conclude the prosecutor's
actions constituted error. However, because we cannot conclude that the
error materially prejudiced Appellant, we cannot conclude that the prosecutor's actions rose to the level of prosecutorial misconduct that
deprived Appellant of a fair trial.

{¶89} The record reveals that the prosecutor asked a prohibited
question one time to one witness. Thus, this was an isolated incident. Further, despite the fact that all parties agreed there would be no mention of Appellant's ownership of cattle, we find any connection between ownership of cattle and the idea that such ownership must mean an individual is wealthy to be tenuous at best in the current time in which we live. Further, we are aware of no link between ownership of cattle and the commission of drug offenses. As such, acknowledging the technical error, we find no material prejudice to Appellant that deprived him of a fair trial. As such, having found the prosecutor's actions did not rise to the level of
prosecutorial misconduct, we cannot conclude the trial court erred in granting a mistrial on this ground",Resentencing,prosecutorial misconduct,Matthew W. McFarland,Matthew W.

Donovan,Sean M. Donovan,Morrissette,Joshua,Joshua Morrissette,Black,2017,Murder,Murder,,,,Male,27 to life,,2017,"Summation,Opening statements,Examination of witnesses","In his second assignment of error, Morrissette contends that he is
entitled to a new trial because of misconduct by the prosecutor. He takes issue with the prosecutor’s use of his nickname Psycho throughout the trial and with some comments the prosecutor made during closing argument.

{¶42} Morrissette contends the prosecutor’s comments transcended the
bounds of acceptable argument. Specifically, Morrissette argues the reference to Hinckley, the “would-be assassin” of former President Ronald Reagan, was improper and highly inflammatory. We agree that the reference to Hinckley, which defense counsel objected to, was improper and the prosecutor should not have injected that name into the trial. But we reject any possibility that the prosecutor’s fleeting reference to the name denied Morrissette a fair trial. We conclude instead, in the context of the entire closing argument and the other evidence at trial, that the reference to Hinckley was harmless. 

{¶47} Next we address Morrissette’s contention that the prosecutor
committed prejudicial misconduct by suggesting to the jury that the evidence contained a “behavioral fingerprint” that tied Morrissette to Tremble’s murder. The import of the state’s argument was that Morrissette’s possession of a .40-caliber pistol with an extended magazine at the time of his arrest on October 5, 2016, was
indicative that Morrissette was the person who had shot Tremble with a .40-caliber pistol with an extended magazine on April 16, 2016.",Harmless error,"The prosecutor used the nickname a few times when it was not
required for identification or clarification purposes, such as after a witness who only knew Morrissette as Psycho had already confirmed Morrissette’s identity as the defendant. This unnecessary use was improper, but it was not an overt attempt to impugn Morrissette’s character and any impugning effect was negligible. At no point
did the prosecutor bring up the origin of the nickname or argue that the nickname reflected on Morrissette’s character.
After considering these facts and the state’s overwhelming evidence of guilt, we conclude that the unnecessary use of the Psycho nickname by the prosecutor was not outcome determinative and did not result in plain error.


{¶48} We agree with Morrissette that this “behavioral fingerprint” argument was improper, as the record did not contain the requisite type of evidence to support the proof-of-identity argument suggested by the prosecutor. [...] Although this argument was not based on the evidence, Morrissette has failed to show plain error on this record, which contains overwhelming evidence of his guilt. ",,,Cunningham,Penelope R.

Appellant argues that the trial court failed to grant a mistrial or impose a
sanction when the prosecution elicited testimony from witnesses regarding statements made by Appellant, where these statements were not provided to the defense in its demand for discovery.

FAILURE TO DISCLOSE TEXT MESSAGES

{¶22} Appellant’s first argues that prejudicial error occurred when the trial court permitted these text messages to be admitted at trial when they were not timely produced by the state in the defense demand for discovery. Appellant contends the trial court abused its discretion by failing to impose a sanction for untimely disclosing this text message evidence, again relying on a former version of Crim.R. 16(E)(3)",No error,"FAILURE TO DISCLOSE WITNESS TESTIMONY

This record shows the state did not run afoul of the discovery rules.

FAILURE TO DISCLOSE TEXT MESSAGES

{¶24} The record reveals the state received these text messages from a lay witness the evening of Monday, May 1, 2017. (Tr., p. 166.) Both parties concede that the prosecution provided defense counsel with emailed copies of the text messages the morning of Wednesday, May 3, 2017, the day before trial. Following voir dire and prior to empaneling the jury on Thursday May 4, 2017, defense counsel moved to exclude the text messages under Evid.R. 404, prior bad acts evidence. At that time, the state indicated that it did not intent to introduce the text messages as evidence during trial, but if it were to seek admission the state would rely on Evid.R. 801(D)(2), admission by a party-opponent. The trial court found “a statement is not hearsay if the statement is offered against a party and is the parties’ own statement.” (Tr., p. 169.) The court
ultimately overruled the motion but stated that the court would reconsider the issue if and when the state sought admission of the text messages into evidence. We note that Appellant did not request a continuance based on this evidence. 

{¶29} In the instant matter, the state disclosed the new evidence within
approximately one and one-half days of receiving the materials. While discovery and disclosure were both on the eve of trial, similar to Morris, these materials were disclosed the day prior to trial and were not actually used in trial until the final day of testimony, against the final witness on cross-examination. This occurred four days after the initial disclosure. Disclosure within days of receiving the discovery materials does not meet
the definition of “willful.” Given that the evidence was disclosed within a day and a half of receiving the materials and that the evidence was not used until four days later on the final day of witness testimony, it is evident that the short period before disclosure occurred in this case does not rise to the level of a willful violation of the rule. 

{¶34} Appellant does not meet the burden of proving willful nondisclosure, beneficial foreknowledge in preparing a defense, or prejudice from late disclosure of the evidence. Even if Appellant did meet this burden, the remedy imposed by the trial court would be adequate and within the scope of the discretion of the trial court. ",,Crim.R. 16,Cheryl Waite,Cheryl L.

The State then went on to explain that such a photograph depicts only a moment in time, and cannot show the whole story. (T. at 818). In closing argument, a prosecutor may comment on “what the evidence has shown and what reasonable inferences may be drawn therefrom.” Lott, supra, 51 Ohio St.3d at 165. We find the statement above a fair comment on the evidence.

{¶51} In the other two challenged statements, we do not find the prosecutor's statements to be improper because he did not shift the burden of proof to Appellant, and these statements did not deprive Appellant of a fair trial. Read in context of the surrounding argument, it is clear that the State is asking the jury to evaluate the credibility of the witnesses. The State asks the jury to consider the testimony of the victims and the Appellant and use their common sense. Further, the State tells the jury to “hold us to our burden, reasonable doubt, beyond a reasonable doubt”.

Foetisch testified as both a lay witness (as M.S.’s treating physician) and as an expert (in orthopedic medicine generally). Heiney argues that Foetisch’s expert testimony violated Crim.R. 16(K), and the trial court improperly limited his crossexamination of Foetisch. ",No error,"{¶ 77} Recently, in State v. Walls, 6th Dist. Erie Nos. E-16-027, E-16-028, 2018-Ohio-329, ¶ 31, we held that “Crim.R. 16(K) mandates exclusion of expert testimony where a written report has not been disclosed in accordance with the rule.” And we agree with Heiney that Crim.R. 16(K) requires a report prepared by the expert―not the prosecutor or anyone else―so that opposing counsel can cross-examine the expert with
his or her own words. In this case, however, Heiney expressly waived any argument that Foetisch should have been precluded from testifying as an expert under Crim.R. 16(K): when the state moved for Foetisch to be designated as an expert in orthopedic medicine, Heiney’s counsel responded “no objection.” See State v. Williams, 6th Dist. Lucas No.
L-14-1067, 2015-Ohio-1686, ¶ 17-21 (appellant waived the Crim.R. 16(K) violation by objecting only to the admission of the expert’s report and not to the expert’s testimony.) 

{¶ 79}  We find that Foetisch’s testimony relating to the AMA guidelines was confined to his own experience and training, and he was not asked to
render an expert opinion beyond his own practice. 

{¶ 80} Second, Heiney complains that Foetisch should not have been allowed to testify that he, as a practicing orthopedic surgeon, has never found it medically necessary to give a patient a breast exam. This testimony was not beyond the scope of the Crim.R. 16(K) letter, which expressly states that Foetisch “has never found it medically necessary
to give a patient of his a breast exam * * * [and that he] does not consider it a typical course of practice for an orthopedic doctor to perform breast exams.”

{¶ 81} Finally, Heiney claims that Foetisch was somehow allowed to provide expert testimony “regarding the complaint [M.S.] filed with the medical board.” We disagree. The objection that Heiney relies upon concerned Foetisch’s testimony regarding his own “patient scheduling worksheet” which contains a notation that M.S. “called inquiring about procedure for [shoulder] exams as treated with another ortho with
each visit becoming increasingly invasive and inappropriate. Pt was quite tearful.” This was not expert testimony and, in fact, it did not even reference M.S.’s medical board complaint. 

{¶ 82} In sum, Foetisch did not offer any expert opinions beyond the scope of the letter. ",,"harmless error,Crim.R. 16",Mayle,Christine E. Mayle,Arlene Singer; Thomas Osowik,"Arlene Singer,Thomas J.

erred as a matter of law by permitting the prosecutor to make improper remarks during closing argument, prejudicing Patterson’s right to a fair trial

OTHERS, irrelevant evidence - no error

{¶8} In his second assignment of error, Patterson argues that the trial court erred as a matter of law by permitting the state to introduce irrelevant and prejudicial evidence in violation of Patterson’s right to a fair and impartial trial.
Patterson attacks the introduction of the Facebook photograph used by the victim to identify Patterson, and the introduction of recorded phone calls from the jail",Did not reach error/conduct did not result in prejudice,"Patterson argues that the prosecutor improperly commented on his
notice of alibi in closing. Patterson’s counsel objected, and the trial court sustained the objection with an instruction to the jury to disregard the statement. Thus, even if the prosecutor’s statement was improper, we assume the jury followed the trial court’s instruction and did not consider the statement


{¶33} Patterson also argues that the prosecutor improperly relied on the jail calls during closing argument to shift the burden of proof. The prosecutor commented on the jail calls in order to show Patterson’s concern about his upcoming trial, rather than his concern as an innocent bystander. The prosecutor’s conduct was not improper with regard to the jail calls


{¶34} Patterson also argues that the prosecutor improperly characterized the law on complicity. At the beginning of closing argument, the prosecutor told the jury that mere presence at the scene of a shooting is not enough to prove complicity with regard to the felonious-assault charge, and that active participation is required. The prosecutor stated that once Patterson and Peck had pulled out their guns in the course of the attempted robbery, “[i]f somebody gets shot and you are pointing a gun, I don’t care if you don’t pull the trigger, you are just as responsible as the person that did.” Patterson does not argue why these statements are an improper characterization of the law on complicity",,,Deters,Dennis Deters,"Zayas, Myers","Marilyn Zayas,Beth A.

In this case, it appears that the prosecutor began to improperly assert personal knowledge or outside research into the movie Tombstone into the line of questions about the social media post's meaning.

However, the jury was specifically instructed ""[y]ou must not draw any
inference or speculate on the truth of any suggestion included in a question that was not answered."" (Jury Instructions at 3.) The question was not answered, the prosecutor did not reassert the quote was not in the movie, and in follow-up questions appellant had the chance to clarify the quote did not actually include the word ""tombstone"" but, instead, appellant wrote ""becomes tombstone"" as a reference to the movie itself. (Tr. Vol. 5 at 946.) Moreover, whether or not the quote was from or referencing to the movie had little, if any, impact on whether it was nonetheless a veiled threat or not.

CO - This case has an extremely lengthy procedural background.  After this case was decided, Shine-Johnson appealed the case to the Ohio Supreme Court. The court declined jurisdiction in May 2019. Shine-Johnson appealed once again to the supreme court in June 2019. The case was dismissed in August of the same year. Shine-Johnson requested a reconsideration, which was denied in October 2019. Shortly after that, Shine-Johnson engaged in multiple federal lawsuits. Shine-Johnson filed a habeas petition (2:2020cv01873) and multiple civil lawsuits (2:2020cv05919, 2:2020cv03301, 5:2020cv00981) around the same time.  The civil lawsuits surrounded conditions in a facility (Belmont) during the pandemic. In April 2020, Shine-Johnson filed a habeas petition alleging prosecutorial misconduct. In relation to the specific claims, the only new thing were more specifics on the alleged PM at trial and a new claim that police altered exculpatory evidence. In recommendations provided by the magistrate, the court did not find the appellate court previously erred in how it ruled on the PM. And it also found that the defendant failed to prove the missing evidence (a pin) was exculpatory nor that it was ever in the gun in question. A judge accepted the report and recommendations in November 2021. Shine-Johnson then appealed to the Sixth District. The court denied his application for a certificate of appealability and a request for a rehearing. Shine-Johnson then appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. In February 2023, the court denied his petition for a writ of certiorari. It denied a petition for rehearing in May of this year.

Pigg also present

CO- Docket has Gary Bishop as the trial prosecutor but a transcript from the sentencing date has prosecutors Ben Zushin and Brandon Pigg as appearing in court. Zushin states on the record on December 4, 2017 that he had been assigned to the case three business days before and turned over additional material when he realized it was missing. That seems to indicate that another trial prosecutor failed to meet discovery obligations but it's hard to know who for sure.

The prosecutor discussed a gun in hypothetical scenarios to explain how stress can account for shortcomings in eyewitness testimony. Lanter argues these remarks were made to incite juror fear and unfairly prejudice the jury against him. Since Lanter did not object to these comments at trial, we review for plain error. See Crim.R. 52(B). Prosecutorial misconduct rises to the level of plain error only if it is clear the defendant would not
have been convicted in the absence of the improper comments. State v. Jones, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-160826, 2018-Ohio-1130, ¶ 12.

At the outset, the prosecutor’s back-handed reference to Remy as a “monster” was made in the context of rebuttal argument regarding an intimidation count against Tamara Remy, not regarding Remy’s actions themselves. The substance of the argument was that Tamara Remy committed intimidation of a victim/witness by not shielding her children from Remy at a visitation. Remy was analogized to the monster under the bed for these children; the jury was not asked to convict Remy because Remy was a monster who needed to be locked away. We do not approve of the State’s reference to a defendant as a “monster” in closing argument, whether explicitly or metaphorically.

offered for the truth of the matter asserted and no other evidence exists that Stein was a drug dealer, the State cannot imply during closing arguments that Stein is a drug dealer.

Given that irrelevant evidence of prior bad acts was admitted and improper statements by the State during closing argument focused on that evidence, counsel’s performance was deficient by not objecting.

This court cannot find that this evidence and the argument of the State did not have an impact on the verdict. Additionally, the remainder of the evidence was not overwhelming when it comes to self-defense. The testimony was inconsistent as to what happened, how Stein was carrying the gun, and even who shot first. Davidson, who was the one who shot Stein, testified that he fired first and Stein returned fire after he had been shot. Given the inconsistency of the testimony, this court does not find that the jury could not have found that the affirmative defense of self-defense was applicable and that the verdict would be the same beyond a reasonable doubt.

potential juror based on race in violation of the rule of Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986).



{¶48} Smith next argues that prosecutorial misconduct denied him a fair
trial, requiring a reversal of his convictions. In support of his argument, Smith cites the cumulative effect of the state’s questioning of Robbins, its impeachment of Wynn and Smith, and its improper remarks in closing argument.


Smith’s remaining challenge is to remarks made by the state during closing argument.  We consider the closing argument in its entirety when determining whether it prejudiced the defendant. Slagle at 607.

{¶51} Here, Smith did not object to the alleged improprieties in the state’s
closing argument. To prevail on these claims, he must establish “both that
misconduct occurred and that but for the misconduct, the outcome of the trial clearly would have been otherwise.” See State v. Pickens, 141 Ohio St.3d 462, 2014-Ohio5445, 25 N.E.2d 1023, ¶ 109. 

Smith asserts that the assistant prosecuting attorney improperly commented on the evidence adduced by Smith to support his selfdefense claim, and called Smith a “monster.”",No error,"BATSON

In light of the prospective juror’s statements, we cannot say that the
trial court’s acceptance of the state’s race-neutral explanation was clearly erroneous.

EX. WITNESSES

{¶50} We have already held that in the first three challenged instances the
trial court did not err or did not permit prejudicial error by the state. The state’s comments made during the questioning of Robbins and the impeachment of Wynn and Smith were not improper and did not affect Smith’s substantial rights. See Jones

CLOSING
{¶52} The comments on the state of Smith’s self-defense claim were each
based on the evidence presented at trial and were within the latitude afforded in closing argument. 
The prosecuting attorney’s characterization of Smith as a monster, while certainly intemperate, was arguably supported by the facts of the
case. See State v. Walker, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-060910, 2007-Ohio-6337, ¶ 47.

during the trial – during voir dire, the testimony of Officer Robinson, the failure to produce all of the Village minutes, and during closing arguments.


Exa. witnesses
“The court erred when it permitted the state to question a witness regarding an ultimate issue of law – whether Appellant may have committed a crime – and by making statements that bolstered the testimony of the State’s witness.”
{¶42} This assignment of error raises issues with a portion of Officer Casey Robinson’s testimony

DISCOVERY

“Trial court erred when it failed to investigate and order a sanction for a discovery violation the state committed and instead permitted a witness to testify to conclusions she reached based on her review of documents that the defense had moved to compel but that the state failed to produce, all in violation of the defendant’s right to due process and a fair trial.” {¶51} This assignment of error is based on testimony from Christina Latynski, the Assistant Auditor III for the State of Ohio. 

JURY SELECTION 
{¶66} The alleged improper conduct during voir dire occurred during the
questioning of a prospective juror. That prospective juror was removed through Appellant’s use of one of his preemptory challenges.",Did not reach error/conduct did not result in prejudice,"Testimony: “The court erred when it permitted the state to question a witness regarding an ultimate issue of law – whether Appellant may have committed a crime – and by making statements that bolstered the testimony of the State’s witness.”
{¶42} This assignment of error raises issues with a portion of Officer Casey Robinson’s testimony


Discovery: ""Any error regarding these minutes does not constitute plain error [...] {¶62} All of this was part of Appellant’s defense. He asserted there was no evidence he used his office to sell the Village the Tahoe. There was no evidence in the poorly kept records and there was no testimony stating how he exerted his authority.
Consequently, his defense was not affected by the failure to disclose this evidence which had nothing to do with the acquisition of the Tahoe or even the Charger. Consequently, it does not constitute plain error; the alleged error did not affect the outcome of the trial. {¶63} This assignment of error lacks merit. 

Jury selection:  It was probably a necessary line of questions to determine if the person could be fair and impartial given that the prospective juror was a former government employee. The prosecutor did not ask if the employee could enter into a contract with
the government. Rather, the prosecutor used the word “should,” meaning is it the best idea to enter into a contract with the government. Thus, the prosecutor was not asking the ultimate issue.
{¶69} Therefore, no error occurred in this questioning, let alone plain error.

First, Appellant failed to properly request a copy of the video and no such request appears in the record. Second, Appellant failed to object to the trial court’s proposed use of the video. Assuming arguendo that Appellant had properly objected, his assignment would still fail. Appellant has not demonstrated that the alleged error affected the outcome of the trial. The trial court’s conclusion is supported by Patrolman Lucas’s testimony, and the court clearly believed this testimony to be credible. Further, Merry conceded that Appellant sounded the horn when he realized Shrewsbury was making a right turn, but did not engage the brake until the Jeep had collided with Shrewsbury’s car. (Tr., p. 14.) Hence, this record reveals no manifest miscarriage of justice occurred as a result of the state’s failure to provide a copy of the video to Appellant.

There were appeals/habeas claims (to the appellate court, Ohio Supreme Court, and federal court) filed by this defendant prior to the present case. 

Dibiase appealed this decision in July of 2018. The Ohio Supreme Court declined jurisdiction in the case in September 2018. In January 2019, DiBiase filed a habeas petition with the Ohio Northern District alleging much of what was in this appeal, including the prosecutorial misconduct. THERE IS ALSO A COPY OF A COMPLAINT FILED WITH ODC. ODC responded saying the claim must be fully litigated in order for them to investigate. In August 2019, the magistrate in the case recommended the case be sent to the sixth district court of appeals to decide whether the case could be heard (due to procedural rules about successive habeas claims.)

Ford,Reynolds,Darnell,Darnell Reynolds,Black,2016,Sexual violence,rape,"aggravated robbery, firearms specifications under R.C. 2941.145",,,Female,33 years,,2016,Brady violation,"{¶ 40} In his fifth potential assignment of error, counsel contends that the trial court erred by denying Reynolds’s motion to dismiss based on the state’s failure to preserve evidence. In his motion, Reynolds argues that his due process rights were violated when the TPD destroyed the clothes that victim 1 wore at the time of the rape. The clothes were destroyed in March 2013, which was after victim 1’s rape kit was sent to BCI for testing, but before Reynolds was identified as a suspect. In its response to Reynolds’s motion, the state conceded that the TPD destroyed the clothing, but argued that Reynolds failed to show that the clothes were materially exculpatory and that Reynolds had no evidence that the state destroyed the clothes in bad faith. 
",No error,"{¶ 43} The record does not support Reynolds’s contention that the destroyed clothing was materially exculpatory. The clothing was not exculpatory on its face and Reynolds points to no evidence showing that the outcome of his trial would have been different if he had been given access to the clothes.

{¶ 44} Because the clothing was potentially useful evidence, Reynolds is required to show that the TPD acted in bad faith by destroying it. He does not do so. Reynolds’s motion to dismiss does not allege any wrongdoing (aside from the destruction of the clothes) or attribute any dishonesty, ulterior motive, or ill will to the TPD. Without such evidence, Reynolds cannot meet his burden of showing that his due process rights were violated. We find, therefore, that counsel’s fifth potential assignment of error is not well-taken.

received ineffective assistance of counsel because his attorney failed to
object to prosecutorial misconduct in closing argument, thus denying him his constitutional rights under the Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments. We initially note that failure to object to an alleged error waives all but plain error. State v. Keeley, 4th Dist. Washington No. 11CA5, 2012–Ohio–3564, ¶ 28. Notice of Crim.R. 52(B) plain error must be taken with the utmost caution, under exceptional circumstances and only to prevent a manifest miscarriage of justice. State v. Rohrbaugh, 126 Ohio St.3d 421, 2010–Ohio– 3286, 934 N.E.2d 920, ¶ 6; State v. Long, 53 Ohio St.2d 91, 372 N.E.2d 804 (1978), paragraph three of the syllabus. To find plain error, the outcome of  Athens App. No. 16CA3 29 trial must clearly have been otherwise. State v. McCausland, 124 Ohio St.3d 8, 2009–Ohio–5933, 918 N.E.2d 507, ¶ 15; State v. Braden, 98 Ohio St.3d 354, 2003–Ohio–1325, 785 N.E.2d 439, ¶ 50. ",No error,"{¶47} In this case, we have already determined that the trial court did
not err or abuse its discretion in admitting testimony and evidence indicating Appellant's urine tests results revealed he had taken illicit drugs on the night of his traffic stop and arrest. Thus, it cannot be said that the prosecutor's statements were improper or constituted prosecutorial misconduct in light of this ruling. Nor can it be argued defense counsel was ineffective for failing to object in light of the trial court's prior ruling. In light of the prior ruling, defense counsel could have reasonably determined it was a better strategy not to continue to draw attention to the evidence by continuing to lodge
objections. 

{¶48} As such, based upon a review of the record and considering the
complained of statements within the context of the entire trial, we cannot say the Appellant would not have been convicted in the absence of the
statements. Further, we have already noted that Appellant's conviction was based upon sufficient evidence. Based on the trial court's instructions, as well as the other evidence in the record which sufficiently supports  Athens App. No. 16CA3 36 Appellant's conviction, we cannot say that the prosecutors' statements made during closing argument, which were not objected to by defense counsel, changed the outcome of the trial. Nor can we conclude that but for counsel's errors, the result of the trial would have been different. Accordingly, we cannot conclude Appellant's trial counsel was ineffective. Thus, we find no merit to Appellant's third assignment of error and affirm the judgment of the trial court.",,prosecutorial misconduct,"Matthew W. McFarland, Judge",Matthew W.

He claims that the state had possession of a CD recording with the second woman that if played in full would have exonerated him of the rape charge. However, it is difficult to discern to which CD or conversation Anderson is referring. At times, in reviewing his submissions, it seems like he is referring to the conversations between himself and the victim that are on exhibit No. 6. Anderson claims that the state played only a part of these conversations, and the whole conversation would have presented exonerating
evidence. At other times, he seems to be referring to a conversation between the victim and the detective, which is mentioned in a discovery disclosure, but this CD was not played at trial. ",Did not reach error/conduct did not result in prejudice,"{¶13} The court has reviewed all of exhibit No. 6, the jail telephone calls between Anderson and victim, and found nothing exonerating in those calls. Although the record indicates that there were conversations between the detective and the second woman, the content of the conversations are not part of the record. Anderson admits that the conversations were not played during trial. Thus, for purposes of evaluating appellate counsel’s performance, those conversations are not part of the record; declining to raise claims without record support cannot constitute ineffective assistance of appellate 
counsel. To the extent that Anderson refers to the conversations between himself and the second woman, his argument is unfounded. ",,,TIM McCORMACK,Tim McCormack,"EILEEN A. GALLAGHER, A.J.

process when the prosecutor had an improper ex parte communication with the sentencing judge. Specifically, appellant contends the prosecutor provided the judge with a ""letter"" for purposes of sentencing without also providing a copy of the letter to defense counsel. She further argues the prosecutor acted improperly and denied her of her due process rights when he failed to give her notice of his intent to present video evidence and testimony from Dr. Vavul-Roediger at sentencing. 

{¶ 33} Appellant also argues the prosecutor engaged in misconduct when he failed to give her counsel notice that the state intended to present video evidence and testimony from Dr. Vavul-Roediger at sentencing. Appellant contends that had the prosecutor given such notice, defense counsel would have had ""more time to appropriately prepare potential crossexamination and/or rebuttal witnesses."" ",Did not reach error/conduct did not result in prejudice,"{¶ 32} Furthermore, appellant had an opportunity to be heard with respect to
sentencing. Not only did appellant's counsel file a sentencing memorandum, but defense counsel was given the opportunity to present mitigation, rebut the information presented by the state at the sentencing hearing, and present an argument as to why the court should have imposed a community control sanction rather than a prison term. As appellant was not denied due process and has not established a prejudicial impact from the prosecutor's alleged ex parte communication, she has not demonstrated plain error and her arguments are without merit. 

{¶ 37} As the prosecutor subpoenaed Dr. Vavul-Roediger, thereby giving some notice of his intent to present her testimony at the sentencing hearing, and provided all the materials introduced at the sentencing hearing to defense counsel during discovery, we find no impropriety in the prosecutor's conduct. Appellant's prosecutorial misconduct claim fails as she cannot establish that she was prejudiced by the prosecutor's presentation of the videos or Dr. Vavul-Roediger's testimony. Additionally, appellant's claim that her due process rights were violated also fails as she was given advance notice of the materials used at sentencing, her defense counsel had the opportunity to cross-examine Dr. Vavul-Roediger, and she was permitted to present mitigation, information, and argument at the sentencing hearing as to the severity of her conduct and the type and duration of sentence she believed was appropriate for her crimes. Appellant's arguments are, therefore, without merit and her second assignment of error is overruled. 
Footnote: (We further note that the introduction of the videos and Dr. Vavul-Roediger's testimony was permissible and not in violation of any evidentiary rules, as Evid.R. 101(C) ""clearly identifies sentencing hearings as among those
certain criminal proceedings in which the rules of evidence, including the hearsay rule, do not apply."" State v. Bene, 12th Dist. Clermont No. CA2005-09-090, 2006-Ohio-3628, ¶ 21.  Preble CA2017-01-001)",,,"HENDRICKSON, P.J.",Robert A. Hendrickson,"S. POWELL

State v. Huff, 145 Ohio App.3d 555, 763 N.E.2d 695 (1st Dist. 2001). Ultimately, the trial court’s decision to allow testimony regarding West’s credibility as an informant was error. The remedy for prosecutorial misconduct is a new trial. State v. McCleod, 7th Dist. No. 00 JE 8, 2001-Ohio-3480 citing State v. Kennan, 81 Ohio St.3d 133, 1998-
Ohio-459, 689 N.E.2d 929.
{¶24} Accordingly, appellant’s first assignment of error has merit and is
sustained.

Mary DeGenaro ","Cheryl L. Waite,Mary DeGenaro",Paul Gains,Paul J. Gains,"{¶16} The exact passage that is the basis of this assignment of error appears
in the direct examination of Officer Patton, one of the officers of the Task Force. The passage is:
Q Officer Patton, you indicated that you had worked with Anthony
[West]. Did you find him to be credible during the time that he worked
with us?
A Yes.
Q Now, let me go back to you begin this investigation. Anthony
agrees to cooperate. Defense counsel brought up some other instances
of wrongdoings by him. Did we attempt to help him out in any way in
any of that stuff that happened aside from our case?
A No. 

{¶21} Even though the facts in the case at bar are somewhat different from
those in Smith and Rector, the same rule applies. In this case, the prosecuting
attorney aligned himself with the police. Specifically, the prosecutor asked Officer Patton if he found West to be credible “during the time he worked with us?” (Tr. 420). Additionally, the prosecutor asked Officer Patton, “Did we attempt to help him out in any way in any of that stuff that happened aside from our case?” (Tr. 421). The words “us,” “we,” and “our” when spoken by the prosecuting attorney to Officer Patton during trial indicates that the prosecutor’s office and the police share the same viewpoints regarding the evidence, including the credibility of West. With the prosecution aligning itself with the police openly and on the record and Officer Patton assessing West as a “credible” witness, the prosecution was essentially vouching for the witness. There is no indication in the record of corroboration as to why West was a credible informant.

He also contends that Dr. Schlievert’s opinions were inadmissible because they were not stated to a reasonable degree of medical probability. 1. Dr. Schlievert’s testimony exceeded the scope of his written report.

{¶ 17} Dr. Schlievert interviewed Me.W. and Mi.W. on August 1, 2013, and
issued a report summarizing those interviews. The state produced this report to Walls well before trial, but in its opening statement, it became clear that it intended to elicit opinions that exceeded the scope of what was contained in the report. Defense counsel raised this issue with the court, and the state confirmed that it intended to question Dr. Schlievert about topics not included in the report, including delayed disclosure, grooming, and recantation. Walls objected and asked that Dr. Schlievert’s testimony be limited to what was disclosed in his report. ",Harmful error,"{¶ 50} The state’s multiple references to the importance of Dr. Schlievert’s testimony served to highlight the error to the jury, and further demonstrates why Dr. Schlievert’s opinions were “vital to the state’s case.” See McGhee, 11th Dist. Trumbull No. 2014-T-0106, 2017-Ohio-5773, at ¶ 20; Morris, 141 Ohio St.3d 399, 2014-Ohio5052, 24 N.E.3d 1153, at ¶ 30. Moreover, given that Dr. Schlievert’s undisclosed opinions buttressed the credibility of Me.W’s testimony, it is impossible to “excise the improper evidence” to determine whether the remaining evidence, alone, overwhelmingly supports a guilty verdict. Id. at ¶ 29.

{¶ 51} Because of the impact of Dr. Schlievert’s testimony and the state’s actions in emphasizing the improper testimony for the jury, we find that there is “a reasonable possibility that the testimony contributed to the accused’s conviction.” Id. at ¶ 28. We therefore cannot find harmless error and, instead, we must conclude that Walls was prejudiced by the admission of Dr. Schlievert’s undisclosed opinions. Id. The admission of his testimony constituted reversible error requiring remand to the trial court for a new trial.

{¶ 54} Because Dr. Schlievert’s opinions were improperly admitted at trial and Walls was prejudiced by the error, we find Walls’ first assignment of error well-taken. Our conclusion necessitates a remand to the trial court for a new trial. ",New trial,"harmless error,Crim.R. 16",Christine E. Mayle ,Christine E. Mayle,"Mark L. Pietrykowski
James D. Jensen","Mark L. Pietrykowski,James D. Jensen",Kevin J. Baxter,KEVIN J. BAXTER,"{¶ 46} Additionally, there was no physical evidence in this case. The state’s case hinged largely upon whether the jury believed Me.W. Dr. Schlievert’s testimony was important to overcome credibility issues arising from (1) Me.W.’s repeated denials of abuse, (2) her initial statements of support for her father, (3) her delayed disclosure of abuse followed by recantation, and (4) additional instances of dishonesty explored during Me.W. and others’ testimony. 

{¶ 48} The state’s closing argument also highlighted that Dr. Schlievert testified that Me.W.’s delayed disclosure of abuse “is extremely typical of kids of sexual abuse. They wait until they’re comfortable. He said late disclosure is also very common when there’s a lack of a mother. What do we have here. No mother.”

{¶ 49} And the state relied upon Dr. Schlievert’s testimony to explain Me.W.’s recanting of her initial allegations of abuse, telling the jury that Dr. Schlievert explained that this is “very typical for these kids of sexual abuse to recant, especially when the abuse is from a parent and especially when there’s a lack of support of a non-offending caretaker. No mom.”

{¶ 52} Walls also points out that Dr. Schlievert’s opinions were not stated to a reasonable degree of medical probability. “A medical expert’s opinion testimony is only competent if it is held to a reasonable degree of medical certainty or probability.” State v. Smith, 4th Dist. Ross No. 02CA2687, 2003-Ohio-5524, ¶ 16. Dr. Schlievert testified that he did not make a medical diagnosis in his report because he lacked diagnostic certainty:
 Well, I think I was careful to say on direct with [the state] that those
were gut feelings, medical beliefs, but because of the lack of disclosure, I
did not feel that I could make a certain final diagnosis of sexual abuse that
would go on a record that would then enter legal proceedings. * * *

{¶ 53} Dr. Schlievert nonetheless testified at trial that it was his “medical opinion” that “[Me.W’s] behavior [was] consistent with a sexually abused child.” Dr. Schlievert made this diagnosis before the jury even though the state never established that the opinions to which he testified were held to a reasonable degree of medical probability. As such, his opinion testimony was not competent.

He blames the prosecutor for improperly “comment[ing] on the veracity of [C.J.] Spears’s upcoming testimony[]” during opening statements to the jury, and for referring to the “anticipated[] substance of [her] testimony” even though the State “knew that Spears would be either recanting[] [her prior statements] or taking the Fifth Amendment.” Appellant’s Br. 7. ",No error,"{¶ 31} Regarding the prosecutor’s references to what Spears had previously told
the Huber Heights Police Division, we construe these remarks as a description of
Spears’s anticipated testimony, which would not be improper. 

{¶ 34} In addition, Appellant accuses the State of knowing either “that Spears
would * * * recant[] [one or more of her statements to police], or tak[e] the Fifth Amendment at trial.” Appellant’s Br. 7. We view this accusation as implausible. The State issued a subpoena to compel Spears’s appearance, sought to have her declared the court’s witness, apparently requested that she be granted transactional immunity, and objected when the court ruled that Spears could invoke the Fifth Amendment.10 If the State knew that Spears would assert her Fifth Amendment privilege at Appellant’s trial, then it presumably could have saved itself considerable effort. In any event, the record includes no evidence substantiating Appellant’s accusation. Appellant’s second assignment of error is overruled. ",,,"Tucker, J.",Michael J. Tucker,"HALL, J., concurs.
DONOVAN, J., concurring in judgment only. ",,"MATHIAS H. HECK, JR",,"{¶ 29} The prosecutor offered the following comments regarding Spears during opening statements:
 [One of the State’s witnesses will be] C.J. Spears. C.J. Spears went
to [Kricket’s Tavern] that night with [Appellant]. She drove [Appellant] to
the bar. And she told the police that [Appellant] had a gun when he went
into the bar—well, before he went to the bar. And she told the police that
[Appellant] had to have taken [the gun] into the bar because her car was
locked. She was the only one with the keys. Now, C.J. Spears is here,
and she is not here because she wants to be. She is going to be a very
reluctant witness. 

{¶ 30} In Appellant’s view, the prosecutor’s remark that Spears would be “a very reluctant witness” was the equivalent of “directly commenting on the veracity of [her] upcoming testimony.” Appellant’s Br. 8. He argues that the prosecutor’s remark was as problematic as a comment we held in Renner to be “improper for opening statements,” but in that case, the prosecutor implied that the witness, a victim of domestic abuse, might not testify truthfully because the witness “ ‘want[ed] nothing more than to protect her husband.’ ” See State v. Renner, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 25514, 2013-Ohio-5463, ¶ 10-17 and 56-58. Here, by contrast, the prosecutor did not imply that Spears had a motive to falsify her testimony but merely observed that Spears did not want to testify. We find that depicting Spears as a reluctant witness, particularly in the absence of any speculation about the cause of her reluctance, is distinctly different from commenting on her honesty. Her reluctance to testify against a murder suspect could have been the result of an aversion to recalling a traumatic event or a fear of retaliation by the suspect or the suspect’s friends.8",https://www.supremecourt.ohio.gov/rod/docs/pdf/2/2018/2018-Ohio-198.pdf,2018-Ohio-198.pdf (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/38/38/1740607200000/ZIKakE90SRsK8k3rj_jteQ/NgHyOJQ3aiPGqfAA2bU_pfI2FKCgjKMgXwVsjkHqg1DWJPPXgm06jX122gVj-CqdoszcQ59cNYH6GRnKWd4vX_WecS-2Z1QEI9p439RjniTyoeUPjzEkq7WbpwhhDNQ8ScSmKRTtn307-_wV_DdbUA/Q-rJ25C2kcegcuuPasDsopfeiWX8tjVZfFLwqvEIAP0),,,,checked,,,Frances Howe,,,17,21,26,34,Frances Howe,,,2015-CR-3057,,,,,,BROCK A.

contends:  “The State of Ohio committed prosecutorial misconduct by cross-examining Defendant-Appellant on alleged photographs which were never introduced as evidence during the trial and misstated witness testimony. Said trial misconduct constituted plain error.”",No error,"{¶27} It is unknown whether there were photographs of the hole due to the lack of an objection. We are instructed to presume a good faith basis in such a scenario. Moreover, considered in the context of the entire trial, the contested question would not have deprived Appellant of a fair trial even if there were no photographs.

 A witness testified Appellant punched a hole in his wall upon being questioned by the baby’s mother (in an upset and raised voice) about what was wrong with their unconscious three-month-old child as she was preparing to bring the child to the emergency room. The crux of the challenged question had a rational basis. Appellant’s substantial rights were not affected. Accordingly, the trial court was not required to recognize plain error on this topic, and we do not find plain error. This assignment of error is overruled.

{¶17} In cross-examining Appellant, the prosecution asked if people become irritable when they do not sleep. After he agreed, the following took place:
Q Now, you heard the testimony from [the friend] that she saw you
punch a hole in the wall when she and [the baby’s mother] arrived home, correct?
A I did not.
Q You did not do that?
A No, I did not.
Q Okay. So if I have photographs of a hole punched in the wall, those

A Yes. (Tr. 362-363). 

{¶19} The second argument is based upon the prosecutor’s reference to
photographs which were not introduced into evidence. Appellant suggests there were no such photographs (calling them “alleged photographs”) and accuses the state of misconduct. He asserts the reference to photographs never placed in evidence erroneously demonstrated to the jury that he lied to them about punching a hole in the wall, which seriously undermined and damaged his credibility. He concludes this violated his right to a fair trial.

",,,,15 to life,,2012,Opening statements,"{¶ 117} In his third proposition of law, Beasley asserts prosecutorial misconduct in the state's opening statement. The prosecutor began her opening statement to the jury by stating:
So, ladies and gentlemen, in preparing this opening statement I tried my best to think of a word or phrase that best describes the defendant, Richard Beasley. And the phrase that kept echoing in my mind after reviewing everything and preparing for this case was a wolf in sheep's clothing.
I wanted to be sure before I put this in front of everybody that I truly understood what the wolf in sheep's clothing means. So we probably used it at some point in our lives. So I did a little bit of research.
As it turns out, the phrase originates from a sermon by Jesus reporting to Christians who * * *. At that point, defense counsel objected. The record suggests that while she was speaking, the prosecutor put the complete quotation from the Gospel of Matthew on the display screen for the jury to see.  Matthew 7:15: ""Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly are ravening wolves."" King James Version.",Did not reach error/conduct did not result in prejudice,"{¶ 123} In the context of the entire trial, the prosecutor's isolated remark did not substantially impair Beasley's right to a fair trial. See State v. Tibbetts , 92 Ohio St.3d 146, 168–169, 749 N.E.2d 226 (2001) (holding that one isolated remark in closing argument, comparing the alleged crime to a mafia hit, did not deprive the defendant of a fair trial). We reject this proposition of law.

{¶ 122} Beasley contends that the specific remarks in question are uniquely
prejudicial because they invoke the Bible. Courts have found biblical quotations to be inappropriate when used to exhort the jury to return a specific verdict. For example, calling a defendant “the evil one” and invoking the Lord’s Prayer is inappropriate in a sentencing proceeding because doing so “can create the inference that the death penalty is mandatory through their appeal to a higher authority, and * * * allow a jury to delegate its own responsibility for the imposition of the sentence.” Cauthern v.

Was originally charged with three counts of aggravated robbery, three counts of kidnapping, and one count of having a weapon under disability",,,Other,13 years,,2017,"Discovery,Examination of witnesses","DISCOVERY:

{¶17} In his first assignment of error, Rucker argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a mistrial made after Cleveland Police Officer Trevor Majid identified him during trial as the suspect he had chased on July 19, 2015. 

IMPROPER ADMISSION OF OTHER ACTS EVIDENCE:

{¶50} In his fifth assignment of error, Rucker argues that his trial counsel failed to provide effective assistance of counsel by not objecting to testimony offered by the state that Rucker committed an additional robbery of Rafael Cardenas between the robbery of the Maynards and the robbery of Bruce Page. 

WITNESS EXAMINATION:

{¶57} In his sixth assignment of error, Rucker argues that the trial court erred by allowing the state to elicit testimony on redirect that exceeded the scope of cross-examination and lacked relevance. ",Harmless error,"DISCOVERY:

{¶19} It is undisputed that the state did not disclose, prior to trial, that Officer Majid would make an in-court identification of Rucker. The state indicated at trial that it was not aware that Officer Majid would be able to recognize Rucker from their foot chase. 

{¶22} In this instance, it was disclosed to the defense in discovery that Officer Majid had chased the black male suspect accompanying Nicholas Kraft, on foot, before the suspect escaped in Collette McSheffrey’s backyard. It was not disclosed prior to trial that Majid had observed the suspect’s face during the foot chase or that he could identify Rucker at trial. The state informed the trial court that it did not know prior to
trial if Officer Majid would be able to identify Rucker. Officer Majid testified that he was not asked to identify Rucker in a photo array prior to trial or asked to confirm after Rucker was arrested that Rucker was the black male he had chased on July 19, 2015. The trial court denied Rucker’s motion for a new trial but offered to provide a curative instruction to the jury pertaining to Officer Majid’s testimony.

{¶23} In applying the three-part Parson test in this instance we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion in denying Rucker’s motion for a mistrial. Although Officer Majid’s observation of Rucker’s face during their foot chase is imputable to the prosecution for purposes of determining a violation of Crim.R. 16, such imputed knowledge is not sufficient to constitute a willful violation of the discovery rules. State v.
Clark, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 88731, 2007-Ohio-3777, ¶ 47, citing State v. Wiles, 59 Ohio St.3d 71, 79, 571 N.E.2d 97 (1991). Instead, we must consider the acts of the prosecution itself in making the determination of whether the prosecution “willfully” failed to disclose the statements. Id., citing Wiles; State v. Muszynec, 8th Dist Cuyahoga No. 87447, 2006-Ohio-5444. Here, the trial court found that the prosecution learned of
Officer Majid’s identification testimony at the same time as the defense.

{¶24} Under the second Parson factor it is clear that Rucker would have benefitted from learning of Officer Majid’s identification prior to trial. However, under the third factor we find little evidence of prejudice in the record. Rucker’s identity as the black male suspect involved in these robberies was independently established by the testimony of Nicholas Kraft, Collette McSheffrey and even the defense’s own witness, Megan
Mitchell, who confirmed Rucker’s connection to the cab that dropped Mitchell and Rucker off near McSheffrey’s home. Therefore, we find no abuse of discretion in the trial court’s decision to deny the motion for a mistrial.

IMPROPER ADMISSION OF OTHER ACTS EVIDENCE:

{¶55} We find no violation of Evid.R. 404(B) on this record. Furthermore, even if the record did establish a violation of the rule, Rucker has failed to establish under Strickland that there is a reasonable probability that the result of the trial would have been different had the evidence not been admitted. 

WITNESS EXAMINATION:

{¶62} A party may use relevant information to rebut the inference arising from evidence when a party opens the door to otherwise inadmissible evidence. State v. Battiste, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 102299, 2015-Ohio-3586, ¶ 33, citing State v. Jackson, 57 Ohio St.3d 29, 565 N.E.2d 549 (1991).

{¶63} In light of the above authority and under the facts presented, we cannot say the trial court abused its discretion in this instance. ",Other,harmless error,Eileen A. Gallagher,Eileen A.

The court also identified an error in the sentencing entry. The court affirmed the convictions but remanded the case to the trial court to fix the error in the JE. 

Rucker appealed this case to the Ohio Supreme Court in October 2018. Rucker filed a motion to file a delayed appeal. The court denied that motion and the case was dismissed in December 2018.

{¶ 23} Holmes argues that the state committed prosecutorial misconduct where, during closing argument, the prosecutor asked the jurors to give F. ""justice."" Holmes contends that this was an improper appeal to the jurors' emotions and a ""Golden Rule"" argument i.e., an argument asking the jurors to imagine themselves in F.'s place. 

EXAMINATION OF WITNESSES:

{¶ 29} Holmes argues that the prosecutor committed misconduct by publishing to the jury the portion of F.'s recorded conversation concerning Holmes' dream",Did not reach error/conduct did not result in prejudice,"SUMMATION (NO ERROR):

{¶ 26} The prosecutor's remarks were not an improper ""Golden Rule"" argument as the prosecutor was not asking the jurors to imagine themselves in F.'s place. Additionally, the Ohio Supreme Court has held that there is nothing inherently improper in calling for justice for a victim. State v. Lang, 129 Ohio St.3d 512, 2011-Ohio-4215, ¶ 266 (noting that
attorneys are granted a certain degree of creative latitude in closing arguments).  

{¶ 27} Finally, the prosecutor's remarks were fair comment on the evidence presented at trial as it referenced a specific a portion of F.'s testimony on cross-examination: 

{¶ 28} Thus, the remarks highlighted what the state perceived as an important portion of F.'s trial testimony. There is no error here, plain or otherwise, and no indication that the prosecutor's remarks denied Holmes a fair trial. 

EXAMINATION OF WITNESSES (DID NOT REACH ERROR):

{¶ 31} Consequently, even if this court had concluded that admission of the dream statement was erroneous, any error would be invited. Under the invited error doctrine, which is applied when trial counsel is ""actively responsible"" for the trial court's alleged error, a party is not entitled to take advantage of an error that he himself invited or induced the trial court to make. State v. Wesley, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2015-04-077, 2015-Ohio-5031, ¶ 26.

CONSIDERING RULE 404(B) ""OTHER ACTS"" EVIDENCE OF PRIOR INSTANCES OF ALLEGED DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PERPETRATED BY [APPELLANT] AGAINST KAREN BINKS. 

{¶ 43} In his second assignment of error, appellant argues the trial court erred in allowing Karen to testify, over defense counsel's objection, about past incidents in which appellant physically abused her. At trial, after Karen described appellant breaking her phone and grabbing the hood of her sweatshirt, the following testimony and discussion occurred: 

{¶ 44} Appellant contends Karen's testimony was inadmissible under Evid.R. 404(B) as the state neglected to give advance notice of its intent to introduce the ""other acts"" evidence.",Harmless error,"{¶ 47} It is uncontested that the state did not provide appellant with notice in advance of trial of its intent to introduce appellant's prior abusive acts towards the victim. The trial court's determination that appellant's failure to make a formal discovery request somehow waived the notice provision of Evid.R. 404(B) is incorrect. The obligation of the state to provide notice of its intent to use the ""other acts"" evidence pursuant to Evid.R. 404(B) is completely independent of a request for discovery under Crim.R. 16. ""If providing discovery alone were sufficient to satisfy the notice requirements of Evid.R. 404(B) the rule would be superfluous."" State v. Plevyak, 11th Dist. Trumbull No. 2013-T-0051, 2014-Ohio-2889, ¶ 18.
{¶ 48} While the state should have provided advance notice of its intent to introduce the ""other acts"" evidence, its failure to do so does not automatically mean the trial court erred by admitting the evidence or that appellant was prejudiced by the admission of the evidence. As the Staff Notes accompanying Evid.R. 404(B) indicate, ""[t]he rule should not be construed to exclude otherwise relevant and admissible evidence solely because of a lack of notice, absent a showing of bad faith."" 2012 Staff Note, Evid.R. 404. There is no evidence that the prosecutor acted in bad faith – that is, withholding notice of the ""other acts"" in order to gain a tactical advantage at trial. Appellant does not claim in his brief that the state acted in bad faith or that the lack of notice caught him by surprise. Instead, he argues the evidence should not have been admitted and was prejudicial as it was inflammatory in that it tended to show he had a propensity to commit the offense. 
{¶ 52} Accordingly, although we find the trial court erred in overruling appellant's objection to Karen's ""other acts"" testimony on the basis that defense counsel failed to make a formal request for discovery, we find that the error was harmless. Karen's testimony was properly admitted at trial as the ""other acts"" evidence was relevant, offered for a legitimate purpose, and its probative value was not outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. Appellant's second assignment of error is, therefore, overruled",,harmless error,Robert A. Hendrickson,Robert A. Hendrickson,"Robert P. Ringland, Michael E. Powell","Robert Ringland,Michael E.

witnesses about the local trends in overdose deaths, Mr. Ecker has not shown that, but for their
misconduct, the jury would not have convicted him. See Lollis, 2010-Ohio-4457, at ¶ 24. First,
the testimony that the prosecutors elicited on those two occasions was merely cumulative of the
testimony they elicited from Detective Harvey. See, e.g., State v. Christian, 9th Dist. Summit

cumulative of other evidence presented at trial). Second, “[w]ithin the context of the entire trial,

State produced a wealth of evidence tending to show that Mr. Ecker had substantial quantities of
narcotics in his possession, that he admitted having sold heroin to J.C.H. before, that he, in fact,
had sold her fentanyl directly before her death, and that he routinely sold narcotics to other
individuals. He has not shown that testimony about trends in overdose deaths, in general,
affected the outcome of his trial. Accordingly, his third assignment of error is overruled. ",,,CALLAHAN,Lynne S. Callahan,"SCHAFER, P. J.

Specifically, he argues that the State failed to disclose “a printout of Mr. Patterson’s arrest record” and elicited false and prejudicial testimony",No error,"{¶118} In this case, the trial court determined that the State did not violate the discovery rules; yet, it ordered the State to provide Patterson’s criminal-history printout to Frye. Although we defer to the trial court’s discovery-violation determinations, we highly discourage the State’s conduct in this case. See State v. Darmond, 135 Ohio St.3d 343, 2013-Ohio-966, ¶ 19 (stating that “[t]he overall objective of the criminal rules ‘“is to remove the element of gamesmanship from a trial”’” and “[t]he purpose of the discovery rules ‘is to prevent surprise and the secreting of evidence favorable to one party.’”), quoting Papadelis at 3, quoting State v. Howard, 56 Ohio St.2d 328, 333 (1978).

{¶120} The State’s conduct in this case is not emblematic of the spirit of the discovery rules. See State v. Johnson, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 36580, 1977 WL 201612, *2 (Nov. 23, 1977) (“The prosecutor in this case did not comply with the spirit or language of the discovery rules. We condemn such a practice.”); State v. Kopatz, 5th Dist. Stark No. CA-8293, 1991 WL 34876, *2 (Mar. 11, 1991) (concluding that the State’s argument “that the request for discovery only wanted the names of witnesses to be called at trial” was “somewhat disingenuous, and contrary to the spirit if not the letter of the rules regarding discovery”). The record reflects that the State’s response on December 22, 2016 to Frye’s discovery demand documents that the State intended to call Patterson as a witness. (Doc. No. 11). Until the second day of trial, there is no evidence in the recording indicating that the State no longer intended to call Patterson as a witness. The State’s intention not to
call Patterson at trial was exposed only after the State asked Investigator Harrod about Patterson’s criminal history. (May 23-25, 2017 Tr., Vol. II, at 270). After Frye objected, Frye informed the trial court that Patterson’s criminal history was not provided in discovery. (Id. at 272-273). In response, the State asserted that it did not intend to call Patterson as a witness. (Id. at 273-274). The timing of the State’s
indication not to call Patterson gives the appearance of poor trial preparation, at best, or of being disingenuous. Compare State v. Bowshier, 2d Dist. Clark No. 2008 CA 101, 2009-Ohio-6387, ¶ 72 (“Although we find no abuse of discretion, we do not sanction the prosecutor’s eleventh-hour recognition and disclosure of new evidence
when that evidence could have been discovered and disclosed long before trial.”); Toledo v. Drake, 6th Dist. Lucas No. L-15-1152, 2015-Ohio-5497, ¶ 10 (stating that the discovery violation “appear[ed] to be an example of poor trial preparation on the part of the prosecutor” and not a willful failure). Indeed, the State represented to the trial court that it “just ran” Patterson’s criminal history prior to the commencement of the second day of trial. (May 23-25, 2017 Tr., Vol. II, at 276).
The better practice would have been to notify Frye of the State’s amended witness list or to have provided Patterson’s criminal history prior to trial—even if it did not intend to call Patterson as a witness but intended to introduce Patterson’s criminal history as evidence. See State v. Fouts, 4th Dist. Washington No. 15CA25, 2016-Ohio-1104, ¶ 46 (noting that the failure to adhere to the rules of discovery “deprives
the opposing party the opportunity to adequately prepare for trial”).

{¶121} Nonetheless, the trial court exercised proper discretion in concluding that the State did not violate the rules of discovery while still ordering the State to provide Frye a copy of Patterson’s criminal history. Indeed, the rule requires the provision of criminal records of state’s witnesses; however, the rule does not explicitly state when provision of that record is required. Rather, the timeliness determinations are left to the discretion of the trial court. Moreover, Frye did not seek any additional remedy, such as a continuance. See State v. Orsborne, 3d Dist. Allen No. 1-06-94, 2007-Ohio-5776, ¶ 49 (“Orsborne’s attorney did not request any continuances after reviewing the report nor did Orsborne’s attorney request a mistrial.”). Further, the trial court permitted Frye to cross-examine Investigator Harrod regarding Patterson’s criminal history. See id. (“The trial court gave the
defense an opportunity to review the report, and the defense questioned [the witness]
regarding the report.”). 

{¶122} Because the trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the State did not violate the discovery rules, there is no error, let alone a reversible error. As such, Frye cannot demonstrate that his substantial rights were prejudicially affected or that the outcome of his trial would have been different.

{¶125} Even if we assume without deciding that the State’s questions were improper, Frye cannot demonstrate that the State’s questions were prejudicial or that the outcome of his trial would have been different. See id. at ¶ 106. See also State v. Hayes, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 02AP-938, 2003-Ohio-2194, ¶ 133. The trial court ordered the State to provide to Frye a copy of Patterson’s criminal history and
permitted Frye to cross-examine Investigator Harrod regarding Patterson’s criminal history. Compare Hayes at ¶ 133 (concluding that Hayes could not demonstrate “the requisite prejudice resulting from [the State’s] improper line of questioning” because “[i]n responding to the prosecution’s line of questioning * * *, appellant was able to offer probative testimony on cross-examination”). Frye’s crossexamination of Investigator Harrod informed the jury that Patterson has a “lengthy”
criminal history. (May 23-25, 2017 Tr., Vol. II, at 298). Frye’s cross-examination further revealed for the jury that Patterson’s criminal history reflects that, although the disposition of the cases are unknown because they occurred in other states, Patterson was arrested for felony offenses that would have resulted in a weapons disability if he was convicted of those offenses. (Id. at 297-298). (See also id. at 322-325). Investigator Harrod admitted that he did not research the results of those arrests. (Id. at 298). (See also id. at 323). The jury was free to infer that Patterson was convicted of an offense that established a weapons disability and was free to infer that Patterson had motive to put the gun in the toilet. Likewise, based on those inferences, the jury was free to accept or reject Frye’s contention that Patterson put the gun in the toilet. Accordingly, we reject Frye’s argument.

At the same time, Clark filed a third federal habeas case (3:19-cv-01175-DCN) that was identical to the first petition.

During voir dire, the state excused one of the African-American jurors. Lee’s counsel challenged the state’s request and stated, “[s]o, judge, before I get to mine, I’ll just make a Batson challenge in the sense that there’s two African-American jurors out of 22, and number 12 is African-American.” (Tr. 485.) The trial court replied, “[a]ll right. Does the State of Ohio wish to place neutral reasons for excusing juror number 12?” (Tr. 486.) The state answered the trial court by stating, Yes. It’s not his race. It’s the fact that as a pastor he’s been involved with the criminal justice system before. He’s been here for sentencings. He is involved. He’s involved at the juvenile detention center. He’s an advocate for victims, both victims or defendants. And the fact that he’s assisted family members that were accused of crimes. (Tr. 486.)

",,,Male,31 years to life,,2017,"Discovery,Summation","Assignment of Error One: The trial court erred in allowing cell phone site testimony as it was both a discovery violation and was not Daubert tested. The court also erred in qualifying the state’s witness as an expert and admitting his testimony as such, as his conclusions were unreliable and were not within a reasonable degree of scientific certainty. 

Assignment of Error Five: [Johnson] was denied due process and a fair and impartial trial as guaranteed by the 5th, 6th, and 14th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution and Article I Section 16 of the Ohio Constitution based on prosecutorial misconduct. {¶59} In the fifth assignment of error, Johnson argues his constitutional right to a fair trial was violated by prosecutorial misconduct. In support of his argument, he relies  on State v. Jackson, 107 Ohio St.3d 53, 2005-Ohio-5981, 836 N.E.2d 1173, for the proposition that the prosecutor improperly vouched for Miller’s credibility during closing arguments. ",No error,"For the allegation of a discovery violation: {¶30} Defense counsel objected to all evidence related to Johnson’s cell phone because it had not been produced in discovery. The trial court offered to continue the trial to allow the defense time to study the records, question the state’s new witnesses, and retain a defense expert. The trial court indicated it would continue the trial for a month if necessary. Defense counsel objected to the admissibility of the evidence, but declined the continuance, citing his client’s need to finish the trial. The court then proceeded with  trial, and the state presented the cell phone evidence along with Wiles’s testimony. Because Johnson chose to proceed with the trial and declined the continuance, he waived any discovery violation. {¶31} Therefore, the first assignment of error is overruled.

For the allegation of prosecutorial misconduct: {¶60} We note that since defense counsel did not object to the prosecutor’s comments, Johnson forfeited all but plain error. Notice of plain error “is to be taken with the utmost caution, under exceptional circumstances and only to prevent a manifest miscarriage of justice.” State v. Long, 53 Ohio St.2d 91, 94, 372 N.E.2d 804 (1978); Crim.R. 52. {¶64} None of these statements involve evidence or facts outside the record. They all relate to the evidence the jury heard and determined on its own. Thus, these comments did not constitute inappropriate vouching for Miller’s credibility. Thus, there was no plain error. When viewed in its entirety, the prosecutor’s closing argument neither materially prejudiced Johnson nor denied him a fair trial. Jackson, 107 Ohio St.3d 53, 2005-Ohio-5981, 836 N.E.2d 1173, at ¶ 120 {¶65} Johnson also argues he was prejudiced by the cumulative effect of other errors. However, because we declined to find error within each of the prior assigned errors, the cumulative error doctrine does not apply to the instant case. {¶66} Therefore, the fifth assignment of error is overruled.

The appeal states that the state received the records on the first day of trial and that they turned them over to the defense then, in addition to adding witnesses to the list. He also argued the prosecution improperly vouched for a witness during closing arguments. He was convicted on all charges. And the appeals court upheld the conviction. 

After the decision, Johnson appealed to the Ohio Supreme Court, but it declined jurisdiction. In 2019, Johnson filed a habeas petition in federal court that did not allege prosecutorial misconduct and instead alleged that one of the jurors lied about knowing him and that one of the state's witnesses recanted.

In his seventh assignment of error, appellant argues that the state violated due process and his Fifth Amendment right not to present evidence when it questioned Romero on whether a defendant is allowed to forensically test the evidence in a case.
Notably, the state asked Romero to these questions on redirect examination, after appellant cross-examined Romero on whether any fingerprint or DNA analysis had been conducted on the packages of heroin, the backpacks, and the phones.


CLOSING
Here, the prosecutor stated near the beginning of his closing argument,
The heroin involved in this case was a means to an end, that’s what
this is all about. When you are a drug trafficker you need accomplices, you need a supplier, you need buyers, it’s a business. Nobody does it on their own. If there were no users, there would be no drug trafficking. If there were no suppliers, there would be no drug trafficking. And like any other business, every person in that chain of supply is going to take a cut of the profits or as was texted on the defendant’s cell phone, “We’ll split the pros.” He’s a businessman. The problem with that is the stuff he is
pedaling is killing people left and right. He doesn’t care about black or
white, living or dead, he cares about that.

Then, as the last words of his rebuttal argument, the prosecutor stated, “When you come back, I ask that you come back with two guilty verdicts because he needs to be held accountable so people stop dying.” 

DISCOVERY


{¶ 36} In his fifth assignment of error, appellant argues that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to McGhee’s testimony regarding the meaning and interpretation of words contained in the text messages from appellant’s phone. Appellant argues that McGhee’s testimony was improper because he was not qualified as an expert under Evid.R. 702. However, as we held in appellant’s first assignment of error, even if the text messages had been entirely excluded, appellant has not demonstrated a reasonable probability that the result of the proceedings would have been different in light of the remaining incriminating evidence.
{¶ 37} Accordingly, appellant’s fifth assignment of error is not well-taken.

{¶ 38} In his eighth assignment of error, appellant argues that trial 
counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the state’s failure to provide a copy of the dash cam video of the traffic stop before the suppression hearing. In this case, prior defense counsel had received a copy of the video, but appellant’s new trial counsel did not receive a copy until the day of the suppression hearing. Trial counsel was then given an opportunity to supplement his motion to suppress. Appellant, though, makes no specific argument as to how having access to the video earlier would have changed the outcome of the proceedings. Therefore, we hold that appellant again has not satisfied the prejudice prong of the Strickland test. ",Harmless error,"Here, we find that the prosecutor’s questioning did not prejudice
appellant’s substantial rights. Immediately after the prosecutor’s exchange with Romero, the trial court instructed the jury, “I want to remind you at this point that the burden is solely on the State of Ohio, the defendant does not have to produce any evidence.” The Ohio Supreme Court has held that “A jury is presumed to follow the instructions, including curative instructions, given it by a trial judge.” State v. Cepec, 149 Ohio St.3d 438, 2016-Ohio-8076, 75 N.E.3d 1185, ¶ 77. Thus, even if we assume that the prosecutor’s comments were improper, we find no prejudice because of the trial court’scurative instruction. 

CLOSING
We find that the prosecutor’s statements are directed to inflame the
passions of the jurors in relation to the ongoing heroin epidemic, and are therefore improper. Nonetheless, we do not find that this is a close case as appellant contends, but rather the photographic evidence overwhelmingly demonstrates that appellant was an

The argument for prosecutorial misconduct is confusing in this case. The appellant first argued that the body cam evidence shouldn't have been admitted by the trial court. But then once the trial court admitted the evidence, they tried to argue that same admission constituted PM. 

The court did find a kidnapping charge was insufficient against the manifest weight of the evidence and reversed that charge.

MOTION FOR SPECIAL PROSECUTOR AND DISMISSAL WITH
NOTICE OF DEFENSE OF SELECTIVE PROSECUTION. 

{¶46} Now, on appeal, Appellant contends that the State engaged in selective prosecution because it pursued charges against only him, despite an allegation by the victim that she was raped by another individual in September of 2013. Appellant also argues, under this assignment of error, that the trial court erred in applying the rape shield law to the extent that it excluded the victim’s claim of rape by someone other than him, and failed to hold a hearing of the truth or falsity of the victim’s allegation that she was raped by someone else. ",No error,"46: Appellant appears to attempt to bootstrap a rape shield argument to a selective prosecution argument, in essence arguing that the other rape allegation was false and should not have been excluded by the rape shield law, while at the same time arguing that the other rape allegation was true, and that because the State did not pursue charges against that other individual, that he was the subject of selective prosecution. We find a certain inequity in permitting Appellant to argue the other rape allegation was true for purposes of his selective prosecution argument, while arguing that the other rape allegation was false for purposes of his rape shield argument. Appellant cannot argue both theories.
{¶47} After reviewing what can be described, at best, as a very confusing transcript of the combined hearing held on Appellant’s motion alleging selective prosecution, it appears the State stipulated that the victim did, in fact, allege another individual also raped her in September of 2013. It also appears from the trial court's entry denying Appellant's motion for dismissal based upon grounds of selective prosecution that that trial court assumed, for purposes of the motion, that the victim did, in fact, allege she was raped by another individual. Further, it was clear from the hearing transcript that the State did not pursue an investigation of that allegation. Based upon those assumptions, the trial court denied Appellant’s motion to dismiss.
{¶48} We cannot conclude, based upon the foregoing and in light of the applicable test, that the trial court erred in denying Appellant's motion, as it seems the focus of Appellant's argument below was simply that another individual should have been prosecuted as well, and that because only Appellant was being prosecuted, he was the subject of selective prosecution. As set forth above, ""a defendant's burden of establishing discriminatory prosecution is a heavy one, and the mere failure to prosecute other violators of a statute does not establish the defense of selective prosecution."" See State v. Hutchinson, supra; citing State v. Freeman, supra, at 58. Appellant asks this Court to find some invidious motive in relation to the State's desire to
introduce other acts evidence against him at trial, related to charges from twenty years prior that referenced another, unrelated sexual assault. However, we cannot conclude that the existence of such evidence or the State's desire to introduce it demonstrates bad faith, or an invidious motive to prosecute Appellant based upon such impermissible considerations as race, religion, or the desire to prevent his exercise of constitutional rights, as contemplated by the test to determine selective prosecution. Having failed to demonstrate a prima facie case of selective prosecution, Appellant was not entitled to a further hearing on his motion and we find no error in the trial court's denial of Appellant’s motion. ",,harmless error,n/a,,"Peter B. Abele, Matthew W. McFarland, Marie Hoover","Peter B. Abele,Matthew W. McFarland,Marie Hoover",Mark E. Kuhn,Mark E. Kuhn,"This case stemmed from allegations of rape made by a 10 year old girl. The appellant was dating her mother. He was originally charged with five counts of rape, but the jury only convicted him on one count. The appellant argued that his conviction was inappropriate on multiple grounds including that he was denied a speedy trial and that the court failed in not introducing evidence of another rape allegation the 10 year old made against the appellant's nephew. The appellant argued that he was the victim of selective prosecution and should have gotten a special prosecutor because the state only charged him with rape and not his nephew. The appellate court ruled that the appellant did not prove that the state discriminated against him just because they prosecuted him and not another individual.

comments made during closing arguments prejudiced his right to a fair trial.
Specifically, Valdez asserts the State’s comments to the jury during closing
arguments constitute prosecutorial misconduct.",Did not reach error/conduct did not result in prejudice,"Regarding Valdez’s allegation, we begin by noting that defense
counsel objected to the statement and the objection was sustained by the trial judge.
Further, the trial court immediately cautioned the jury, and issued a curative
instruction to the jurors to disregard the prosecutor’s comment. Nevertheless,
Valdez suggests that the prosecutor was commenting on a plea deal between Valdez
and the State which could constitute prosecutorial misconduct. We find otherwise.
In our review, it is evident that the prosecutor was commenting upon Valdez’s jail
conversations (as testified to by Sargent, see generally Tr. Pg. 156), wherein Valdez
stated he would only consider a plea deal if he were to receive four years. The
record is void of any plea negotiations between Valdez and the State. Thus,
Valdez’s jailhouse statements, while objectionable, were not plea negotiations,
merely Valdez’s opinions of an acceptable one. As such we find that the comments
of the prosecutor do not rise to the level of misconduct and the trial judge
appropriately disposed of the prosecutor’s comment through a curative instruction.",,,Zimmerman,William R. Zimmerman,SHAW and PRESTON,,Katherine G.

control violation",,,,9 years 355 days,,,Discovery,"In his first assignment of error, Lincoln contends that the trial court should have
excluded a laboratory report and expert testimony about the report because the State failed to
timely produce the report during pre-trial discovery. The State claims that its failure to produce
the report during pre-trial discovery was inadvertent, and that the trial court properly exercised
its discretion in admitting both the report and expert testimony about it.",Harmful error,"First, we think that in the exercise of due diligence, the existence of the second
lab report should have been known to the prosecutor’s office well in advance of trial. At a
minimum, inadvertence or negligence appears to be involved in failing to disclose the second lab
report in compliance with Lincoln’s discovery request. Nevertheless, in the absence of any
evidence contradicting the State’s explanation, we cannot find on this record that the State’s
failure to comply with Lincoln’s discovery request was a willful violation of Crim.R. 16.

As to whether foreknowledge of the second lab report would have benefitted
Lincoln in the preparation of his defense, we conclude that it clearly would have. “[O]ne could
ask how a defendant can prepare to defend a drug possession [or drug trafficking] case if he does
not know what the laboratory reports state. For instance, counsel would want to know the
answers to the following questions to prepare for trial: what kind of drugs were discovered, did
any substances test negative for drugs, what was the amount of drugs found in each place, was
any amount so small that it was just residue on the paraphernalia, do any of the reports deal with
fingerprints on the paraphernalia or bags, and who are the scientists that will have to be crossexamined?”
State v. Brooks, 7th Dist. Jefferson No. 04JE10, 2004-Ohio-4546, ¶ 35. Without knowing the expert’s findings, or in this case, that chemical analysis was even conducted on a

{¶14} In his first assignment of error, Steelman contends that the state used his prearrest silence in the Wittich interview as substantive evidence of his guilt, in violation of the Fifth Amendment’s protection against self-incrimination. Steelman is correct. 

{¶26} Here, the prosecutor stated, “If someone else had stolen that sack of money he would have told Det. Wittich ‘I don’t know how much was in there, Larry gave it to me.’ ” The prosecutor also argued during rebuttal that Steelman had “had a chance” to explain himself to Wittich and to tell him who else had been involved, but did not. Defense counsel did not object, so we apply a plain error standard of review.
Neither of these remarks was supported by admissible evidence. We therefore hold that there was obvious error. 

CLOSING
In his third assignment of error, Steelman argues that the assistant
prosecuting attorney made improper remarks during closing argument that resulted in an unfair trial.

+ admission of hearsay also harmless",Harmless error,"{¶34} The prosecutor should not have argued that he knew “for a fact” that Steelman left the Pepsi can in the Hayeses’ basement, and that he knew “for a fact” that Steelman was caught with the Hayeses’ property shortly after the burglary was reported. These statements placed the prosecutor’s personal credibility at issue, and may have suggested to the jury that the prosecutor knew things about the case that the jury did not. They were clearly improper.

{¶36} Next, Steelman contends that the prosecutor committed misconduct by stating that, once the jury began deliberations, “the presumption of innocence is no longer with him * * * it’s up to you to determine if the State has met its burden of proof.” This was clearly improper.

The prosecutor subsequently admitted to the jury that he had misstated the law. The jury was properly instructed regarding the state’s burden of proof before they began deliberations. We presume the jury followed the trial court’s instructions. See Pang v. Minch, 53 Ohio St.3d 186,
559 N.E.2d 1313 (1990), paragraph four of the syllabus. We therefore hold that Steelman was not prejudiced by this misstatement.


¶38} Having found error in (1) the admission of those parts of the Wittich
interview that violated Steelman’s Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination; (2) the admission of Callaway’s hearsay statement; and (3) several of the prosecutor’s comments during closing argument, we must determine whether these errors require us to reverse Steelman’s convictions.

Because the evidence of Steelman’s guilt is overwhelming absent the evidence of his silence and the improper closing statements, we hold that there was no plain error.

As stated above, there was overwhelming independent evidence of
Steelman’s guilt. The error in the admission of his statement was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.",,harmless error,Miller,Charles M.

instances of prosecutorial misconduct and asserts that the alleged misconduct fatally compromised the verdict

Opening: 
{¶ 17} In support of the first assignment, appellant asserts that it was somehow fatally prejudicial for the prosecutor to state during opening arguments, “[H]e’s a young, good-looking man who was popular in high school, a sports star * * * He was used to getting all the girls he wanted.” Appellant goes on to argue that, “The state painted a picture in opening statement of a football star swimming in women.”

Examination of witness: 
{¶ 20} Among the numerous additional instances of alleged prosecutorial
misconduct, appellant asserts that it was improper of the prosecution to elicit testimony from the treating SANE nurse regarding her opinion of the level of physical intrusiveness of a SANE examination as somehow illicitly designed to, “[E]nflame the jury.”

Closing:
{¶ 21} Appellant maintains that the proceedings were somehow fatally
compromised based upon the prosecutor noting in closing arguments that the timing of appellant’s reversal in position from initially stating that no sexual conduct occurred to subsequently conceding to vaginal intercourse coincided with a positive DNA match.",No error,"Opening: 
{¶ 19} We have thoroughly reviewed and considered the record of evidence. We find appellant’s characterization of the prosecution of this case strained and unconvincing. We are not persuaded by appellant’s suggestion that the state somehow improperly capitalized upon claimed current national outrage against sexual misconduct by national sports heroes given appellant’s status as a former football player at a local
college.

Closing:
{¶ 22} Appellant unconvincingly portrays these statements in closing arguments as somehow unlawfully attacking appellant’s constitutional right to remain silent despite appellant’s voluminous, voluntary testimony on his own behalf.

{¶ 23} Appellant ultimately concludes by generically maintaining that the, “State took every opportunity to attack defendant.” Appellant concludes that the numerous claimed acts of prosecutorial misconduct created cumulative and fatal prejudice in the proceedings. Our review of the record does not bear out appellant’s position. The record reflects no improper prosecutorial conduct, either separately or cumulatively.

",,,Male,four years and nine months,,2016,Summation,"III. Prosecutorial misconduct took place in final arguments when the
State argued that Maurice Bradley was in area of E. 92nd Street and
Superior based on his cell phone records when the State presented no
expert testimony concerning location of appellant and his cell phone
at relevant times. ",Did not reach anything/ reverses on other grounds,"{¶99} We find that even when viewed in a light most favorable to the prosecution, the evidence is insufficient as a matter of law to support the verdict in this case. Accepting that the Charger and a cell phone were present at Superior and the sole witness saw a single hand shoot a small gun from a back seat car window from a block away at 9:00 p.m. in the midst of the melee described by Friedman, the evidence is insufficient to support the presence of appellant at Superior, which subsumes the theories  of complicity, aiding, and abetting. This analysis also serves to reverse the finding on the charge of having a weapon while under disability 2923.13(A)(3).

{¶100} In addition to sufficiency, choosing to further address the manifest weight issue, the analysis set forth herein also serves as the foundation of our finding that, sitting as a thirteenth juror and considering whether the “greater amount of credible evidence” supports the conviction, the verdict is against the manifest weight of the evidence. Thompkins, 78 Ohio St.3d at 387, 678 N.E.2d 541.

Prosecutor did not commit prosecutorial misconduct in grand-jury proceeding by commenting that a shooting victim had

EX. WITNESSES -
Appellant also complains that the prosecutor improperly elicited testimony from Officer Shields that this was the ‘‘most gruesome scene’’ she had witnessed


Second, appellant argues that the prosecutor presented victim-impact
testimony from Traniece Wilkins during the trial phase. As we explained in discussing proposition of law No. VII, Traniece’s brief testimony about Ororo was neither overly emotional nor directed to the penalty. See Hartman, 93 Ohio St.3d at 293, 754 N.E.2d 1150. No plain error occurred.

{¶ 175} Appellant also complains that the prosecutor improperly elicited testimony from Officer Shields that this was the ‘‘most gruesome scene’’ she had witnessed.
As we explained in discussing proposition of law No. VII, this testimony was irrelevant but curative instructions corrected any error. In addition, Shields’s testimony that Mister’s shorts were ‘‘saturated in
blood and brain matter’’ was not improper because this information established the condition of Ororo’s body at the scene.

{¶ 176} Finally, appellant argues that the prosecutor committed misconduct in discussing Officer Shields’s testimony during the prosecutor’s trial-phase closing argument. But as we explained in discussing proposition of law No. VII, no plain error
occurred, and we reject these claims.

",Did not reach error/conduct did not result in prejudice,"this testimony was irrelevant but curative instructions corrected
any error. But these were brief remarks. Defense counsel failed
to make a contemporaneous objection to her testimony, and appellant cannot show that these comments resulted in plain error.

{¶39} Near the end of the victim’s testimony, the state presented her with a copy of her written statement to the police. The prosecutor then proceeded to question the victim about some of the details in her statement. Appellant argues that this was an improper use of a prior written statement in contravention of Evid.R. 612


{¶46} Upon review, we find admission of the statements does not rise to the level of plain error because the outcome of the trial would not have been different absent its admission.


{¶56} Here, Appellant argues that his trial counsel was ineffective in failing to object to the state’s use of the victim’s prior written statement.
{¶57} Competent counsel may reasonably hesitate to object to potential errors in the jury's presence because objections may be considered bothersome by the jury and may tend to interrupt the flow of a trial. State v. Howell, 5th Dist. Delaware No. 15 CAA 12 0098, 2016–Ohio–7749, ¶ 39, appeal not allowed, 150 Ohio St.3d 1409, 2017–Ohio– 6964, 78 N.E.3d 909.

This argument was presented in the direct appeal in the fourth
assignment of error; Appellant claimed he did not get a fair trial because of cumulative error and prosecutorial misconduct. Henry, 2017-Ohio-7505 at ¶ 32-33, 56-59. In the direct appeal, Appellant argued Gilliam was indicted for the same crimes he was and since her indictment was dismissed prior to Appellant’s sentencing, there must have been an agreement with the state for her to testify against him in exchange for the dismissal of her indictment. 

{¶34} Appellant now expands upon that argument. He attached judgment entries indicating Gilliam was on probation for a misdemeanor theft offense at the time she was indicted. He contends her probation was not violated upon her indictment and the probation was completely erased from her record. He asserts this is further evidence she had an agreement with the state to testify against him.",No error,"{¶35} The judgments he attached indicate Gilliam was sentenced to one year of probation for theft on March 3, 2015. Appellant’s trial occurred exactly one year later. Thus, the probation would have been completed. Nothing in the attached judgments indicates her probation was erased. His attachments do not indicate she received a probation violation for being indicted. However, it is not unusual for the probation violation to be stayed until the case from which the indictment arose is
resolved. Furthermore, filing a probation violation is a discretionary matter. Therefore, the information provided by Appellant in the postconviction petition does not indicate there was an agreement between the state and Gilliam.",,prosecutorial misconduct,Carol Ann Robb,Carol Ann Robb ,Gene Donofrio; Cheryl L.

In November 2019, the magistrate recommended the case be dismissed after finding that the previous courts acted reasonably -- in particular it reaffirmed the early claim of PM.

Furthermore, the prosecutor’s comments were supported by evidence in the record. 

{¶44} Finally, the trial court instructed the jury that it must decide the case based on the evidence presented and that “closing arguments do not constitute evidence.” (Tr. 1322.) We presume that the jury heeded the trial court’s instructions. State v. Leonard, 104 Ohio St.3d 54, 2004-Ohio-6235, 818 N.E.2d 229, ¶ 157.

During closing arguments, the prosecutor stated, in relevant part, Now, let’s talk about what happened to [M.H.] as a result of her disclosing what [Lynch] did to her. When she said what he did, when she said what he did, this is what happened to her. She had to go to the hospital. As a 12-year-old girl, she had to have her legs up in stirrups with her knees apart, a speculum inserted into her vagina, swabs stuck five to six centimeters into her vagina, swabbing her vagina, and swabbing her cervix. That’s what happened as a result of [M.H.] telling her mom what [Lynch] did to her. 

{¶40} Initially, we note that defense counsel did not object to the prosecutor’s statements about the rape kit examination procedure. 


CO - looks like Lynch appealed this decision to the Ohio Supreme Court. It declined jurisdiction in July 2018. In September 2019, Lynch filed a Habeas Petition in the Northern District of Ohio (1:19-cv-02240-SL.) The filing was rambling and at times incoherent. He accused everyone involved, including prosecutors, defense attorneys, and the trial court, of committing fraud. He didn't make a direct claim of PM, per se, like he did in the state appeals process. The magistrate recommended Lynch's petition be dismissed. And in April 2022, the judge accepted that recommendation and dismissed the petition.

solving a puzzle the state used when trying to explain reasonable doubt to the jury during voir dire amounted to prosecutorial misconduct. The test for whether prosecutorial misconduct mandates reversal is whether the remarks were improper and, if so, whether they prejudicially affected the substantial rights of the accused. State v. Lott, 51 Ohio St.3d 160, 165, 555 N.E.2d 293 (1990). Since counsel did not object to the state’s use of the analogy, Jones is precluded from predicating error on it unless the trial court’s FAILURE to intercede amounted to plain error.

{¶21} In his fourth assignment of error, Jones claims that detectives
repeatedly testified improperly about what they were told during the course of their investigation in violation of State v. Ricks,",No error,"{¶13} Here, the prosecutor posed the example of having a 500-piece jigsaw puzzle without knowing what it pictured before assembling it. The prosecutor asked a prospective juror if the puzzle was an image of the Statue of Liberty, and the juror had about 20 percent of the puzzle complete, would the prospective juror know that it was the Statue of Liberty. The prospective juror replied in the affirmative. 

The prosecutor then continued by then talking about a puzzle that depicted the prosecutor, noting that the juror did not know her and that “[y]ou’d probably need 90% of it.” The prosecutor said that “that example is what I like to use for reasonable doubt, because there is no percentage that we can put on reasonable doubt. I wish I could but we can’t. Sometimes you need 20% or 40%, sometimes you need 90% of it, and it’s okay.” 

{¶15} In this case, the jury was given the proper definition of reasonable
doubt in the jury instructions. In light of this proper instruction, the state’s use of analogy—while ill-advised—did not denigrate the reasonable-doubt standard. **And the comments did not rise to the level where it is clear that Jones would not have been convicted in their absence.*** The trial court’s FAILURE to admonish the state or strike the reference to the puzzle analogy sua sponte did not amount to plain error. We overrule Jones’s second assignment of error.

{¶37} The assistant prosecutor agreed that while DNA and fingerprint evidence connecting Martin to the offenses would have made its case stronger, the evidence the state had presented at trial was sufficient for the jury to find Martin guilty of the offenses. 

{¶38} Defense counsel objected to these remarks and asked to approach the bench. The assistant prosecutor told the jury that she was not saying the defense had the burden of proof. At a sidebar conference immediately thereafter, defense counsel argued the prosecutor’s comments had improperly shifted the burden of proof to the defense and asked the court to grant a mistrial. The trial court denied the motion. In proceeding with her closing argument, the assistant prosecuting attorney told the jury
that the state was not shifting the burden to the defense or arguing the defendant must present evidence.",No error,"{¶40} In closing arguments, the prosecution may comment on the evidence and may respond to arguments made by defense counsel and the failure of the accused or his counsel to offer any evidence in support. 

Here, the assistant prosecuting attorney’s response to the defense counsel’s arguments was proper and contained no impermissible implications. See State v. Collins, 89 Ohio St.3d 524, 528, 733 N.E.2d 1118 (2000); see also State v. Gulley, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-850179, 1986 WL 958, *5 (Jan. 22, 1986); State v. Conner, 6th Dist.

(holding similar remarks by the prosecution during closing argument to be proper comments on the evidence). Thus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Martin’s motion for a mistrial. We, therefore, overrule the fourth assignment of error.

{¶ 56} Appellant asserts that his counsel was deficient in failing to object during closing argument, ""when the State argued that the prior bad acts evidence was proof that 'we' can count on [N.F.]"" (Appellant's Brief at 54.) During closing, the prosecutor noted L.A. and C.A.W. had corroborated much of N.F.'s testimony, and that N.F.'s testimony of the physical abuse was further ""corroborated when we got Children's Services records. So what that tells us is that we can count on [N.F.] to give us reliable, accurate history."" (Tr. Vol. V
at 58-59.) 

Second allegation:
{¶ 59} Appellant asserts defense counsel was deficient in failing to object to the following statement from the prosecutor during closing argument: ""I guess in any rape case, the victim has to be lying. Right? Because if the victim is telling the truth, then the defendant has trouble. Right? So every defense in a rape case is the victim is lying, and then"" the defense has to ""try to scramble to figure out a reason why."" (Tr. Vol. V at 109.) 

Third allegation:
{¶ 61} Appellant argues that counsel was deficient in failing to object to a comment the prosecutor made during appellant's cross-examination. The state asked appellant if he believed that N.F.'s frequent vomiting and urinating himself as a child were stress related. Appellant stated ""[s]omething was going on,"" and the prosecutor noted ""I would agree with that."" (Tr. Vol. IV at 96, 97.) ",No error,"First holding:
{¶ 58} The prosecutor's comment was not improper vouching. The prosecutor fairly commented on the evidence from L.A., C.A.W., and children services caseworkers, who all corroborated N.F.'s testimony regarding the physical abuse. Counsel was not deficient in failing to object to the comment.

Second holding:
{¶ 60} Counsel was not deficient in failing to object to this statement, as the
prosecutor was fairly responding to appellant's testimony that N.F. had lied about the sexual abuse allegations. Moreover, there is no reasonable probability that, had counsel objected, the result of the trial would have been different. State v. Bradley, 42 Ohio St.3d 136 (1989). 

Third holding:
This comment did not express any belief ""regarding the guilt of the accused."" Lott at 166. Rather, the statement merely agreed with appellant's response. Trial counsel could have reasonably chosen not to object to avoid drawing undue attention to the prosecutor's brief and fleeting comment. ",,harmless error,Susan Brown,Susan Diane Brown,"Betsy Luper Schuster, Lisa Sadler","Lisa L. Sadler,Betsy Luper Schuster",Michael DeWine,Michael DeWine,"This is a super interesting (and dark) case. The appellant was originally indicted in Auglaize County but the trial court there concluded the appellant couldn't get a fair trial in the county so they transferred the case to Franklin County. It appears the appeal was handled by the Ohio Attorney General's Office (instead of prosecutors from either Franklin or Auglaize counties.)

The appellant filed an appeal alleging that his attorney failed to object to multiple improper statements by the prosecutor. The appellate court ruled that no improper statements were made. 

In 2019, Wycuff filed a habeas petition (2:19-cv-03549-EAS-CMV.) He alleged identical misconduct to what was alleged in this state appeal. The federal court declined to overrule the state court and stated: ""The record
does not reflect that the prosecutor made improper statements."" 

Wycuff appealed the case to the Federal Sixth District Court of Appeals in early 2021. The appeals court denied the appeal in August 2021. Wycuff then appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. SCOTUS denied the petition for a writ of certiorari in June 2022. 

Looks like some sort of state-level appeal was filed in 2022. I took a look at the docket and it appears that the appeal was related to a motion for a new trial on the grounds that the appellant's original trial counsel had some kind of dementia/alzheimer's at the time of the trial.

Heenan,Scott M. Heenan,Fornshell,Gerald,Gerald Fornshell,White,2018,Sexual violence,public indecency ,Was charged with two counts of public indecency but only convicted of count two.,,,,1 year (with credit for 244 days served) plus 12-months for violating post-release control on a prior conviction,,2018,Brady violation,"{¶4} Mr. Fornshell’s first three assignments of error relate to the evidence
used to convict him. He argues that the state destroyed exculpatory evidence, that the trial court improperly admitted unfairly prejudicial video evidence depicting incriminating conduct at another time and location, and that his trial counsel was ineffective for stipulating to the introduction of that video. His remaining assignments of error concern the weight and sufficiency of the evidence and the propriety of his sentence. We first consider the alleged evidentiary errors.

{¶5} Mr. Fornshell moved (unsuccessfully) to dismiss the charges below on the basis that the state failed to preserve materially exculpatory evidence—namely, the entire security video footage from the Madeira Half Price Books from the evening of the incident, framing this as a violation of his Fourteenth Amendment due-process rights. But this begs two questions—the materiality of the evidence and state action. ",No error,"{¶7} With this standard in mind, Mr. Fornshell cannot satisfy his burden of
demonstrating that the full video footage from the Madeira Half Price Books was materially exculpatory. The parties do not dispute that the incident occurred in the self-help section of the store, and that no video camera captured that portion of the store. Several witnesses, however, vouched for the likelihood of children in the store at the time of the incident. One Half Price Books employee testified that children were in the store. The victim, Ms. Velez, echoed the point, confirming that there were “absolutely” people under the age of 18 in the store at the time of the incident, and that she “probably” encountered children between the incident and her walk to report it. The store manager testified that it is possible to see through the shelves in the self-help area from other sections of the store, including the children’s section, to which it is adjacent. She also testified that the incident occurred on one of their biggest sale days of the year, and that they sell “lots” of toys (attracting children and their parents alike). The manager personally viewed all of the surveillance video between 7:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m. the evening of the incident and identified several distinct, potential minors in the store at or just before the time Mr. Fornshell entered the store.

{¶8} Mr. Fornshell nevertheless posits that the full store footage could have isolated minors entering and exiting while he was in the store. But in view of the litany of evidence above (and in light of our statutory analysis below), we do not believe that this would exculpate Mr. Fornshell. The jury was shown footage of likely minors entering the Madeira store before Mr. Fornshell arrived—consistent with the store manager’s testimony. This evidence undercuts his contention that the full video footage would have been exculpatory. Admittedly, it can often be difficult to establish that evidence that no longer exists is exculpatory, but based on the other available evidence in the record here, we cannot conclude that Mr. Fornshell can make such a showing.

{¶9} With the evidence only potentially useful, this obligates Mr. Fornshell
to establish bad faith on the state’s part to succeed with a due-process claim. But this case involves a third-party (not acting on behalf of the state) disposing of evidence, rendering it more difficult for Mr. Fornshell to connect the destruction of evidence to bad faith on the part of the state.

{¶10} Ohio law generally recognizes that the state need not gather evidence on the defendant’s behalf (but when it does, that is a different story): Although we agree that is not proper for a law enforcement agency to suppress evidence, we also conclude that it is not the agency’s obligation to engage in affirmation action in gathering evidence which an accused might feel necessary to his defense. The accused must protect his own interests. It is only when overzealous officials deny that opportunity can it be said that he is deprived of due process by state action. City of Kettering v. Baker, 42 Ohio St.2d 351, 354-355, 328 N.E.2d 805 (1975).1“ ‘[I]t is not the responsibility of the state to obtain evidence that the defendant can obtain on his own.’ ” State v. Dinardo, 11th Dist. Lake No. 2013-L-108, 2015-Ohio-1061, ¶ 25, quoting State v. Franklin, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 19041, 2002-Ohio2370, ¶ 52 (discussing the state’s burden to obtain 911 tapes). 

{¶11} Mr. Fornshell made a demand upon the prosecuting attorney for videos at the scene and around the time of the arrest, but we cannot construe such a request to encompass evidence beyond the state’s control. Mr. Fornshell did not subpoena the Madeira Half Price Books, nor has he pointed to any authority for the proposition that the Brady doctrine would require the state to secure evidence not in its possession from third parties. Without state action, the panoply of constitutional protections generally does not apply. Bouquett v. St. Elizabeth Corp., 43 Ohio St.3d 50, 53, 538 N.E.2d 113 (1989) (appellee required to show state action to “warrant the constitutional protection of due process”).

{¶12} While we can imagine finding bad faith in a scenario where the state
prevented a defendant from securing evidence from a third-party, that is not the case here, and Mr. Fornshell has failed to offer proof otherwise of bad faith. Detective Vogel testified that he promptly asked Half Price books for all pertinent footage; that he requested “the entire video,” but was told this was nearly impossible. Because the clips that he received substantiated the victim’s claims, he did not persist for the entire video footage. Mr. Fornshell argues that this nonchalance rises to the level of bad faith. But “[b]ad faith implies something more than bad judgment or negligence,” and we do not see anything more serious on the record before us. See State v. Acosta, 1st Dist. Hamilton Nos. C-020767, C-020768, C-020769, C-020770 and C-020771, 2003-Ohio-6503, ¶ 9.

{¶13} Without a showing that the evidence at issue was materially exculpatory or that the state acted in bad faith, (let alone a showing of state action), we overrule Mr. Fornshell’s first assignment of error. ",,Kyles v. Whitley,Bergeron,Pierre H. Bergeron,"Mock
Zayas (concurring separately)","Russell Mock,Marilyn Zayas",Joseph T. Deters,Joseph T. Deters,"Fornshell was convicted of public indecency after masturbating in two different Half Price Books. He alleged that a Brady violation in his case occurred because the entirety of video surveillance footage was not made available to him and was later deleted. A key part of the case was the proximity of children to Fornshell. But there wasn't explicit video footage that put kids near him during the incident, just in the store at the same time. But the court ruled that the state did not have the entirety of the video in its possession and could not be held responsible for the fact that a private business later deleted the footage. It also questioned whether the deleted footage would actually be material or exculpatory.
