Maryland,,,,,Michael C. O'Malley,,"D'Ambrosio was convicted of aggravated murder, kidnapping and aggravated burglary in 1989. In 2006, the federal court in the northern district of Ohio found that the state had committed a Brady violation; it gave the state 180 days to retry D'Ambrosio or set aside his conviction and sentence. The new trial was set for 2009; about a week before it started, the stated disclosed the existence of additional relevant evidence. The trial court postponed the trial, resulting in it falling outside of the 180 day window set by the federal court. The federal court found that the state had violated its discovery obligations during the retrial, and denied its request to extend the deadline and issues an unconditional writ of habeas corpus. 

D'Ambrosio filed a wrongful imprisonment claim that went through a series of appeals before he withdrew it in 2016.

This appeal is about D'Ambrosio's second wrongful imprisonment claim. The state is asserting that the judge in the case doesn't have jurisdiction and that the matter had been settled in the first appeal. The court disagreed and granted the judges motion for judgement.

Austin maintains that these errors meant that he did not have a full understanding of the charges to which he pleaded guilty. [...]
When the state explained the nature of the plea agreement in CR-15-600992, it informed the court that the trafficking count, a third-degree felony, required a mandatory prison term of 9 to 36 months because Austin had previously been convicted of two or more drug offenses. When the court imposed sentence on this count, it stated: “Count 4 is mandatory time — no judicial release or community control.” Austin complains that the court erroneously characterized his sentence as mandatory time and that he suffered prejudice, regardless of whether the court would have sentenced him the same for the offense because he has been deprived of an opportunity for judicial release at an earlier date.",Did not reach anything/ reverses on other grounds,"In remarks made just after imposing sentence, the court stated, “[a]nd but for the constraint of the mandatory sentence, maybe it wouldn’t have happened. But, you know, you — you put the Court in a box by doing what you did.” This statement could indicate that the court imposed a prison term, regardless of duration, only because it believed that a prison term was mandatory. Admittedly, it seems unlikely that the court would have sentenced Austin to prison on the three, fifth-degree felony counts but not on the third-degree felony count. But to constitute harmless error, the error must not affect the “substantial rights” of the defendant. See Crim.R. 52(A). The court’s statement that the mandatory aspect of the third-degree felony count put it “in a box” is enough that we cannot conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the court’s error did not result in any prejudice to Austin. The assignment of error is sustained, and the case remanded for resentencing. The remaining assignments of error are rendered moot by the resentencing.",harmless error,Melody J. Stewart,Melody J.

The court held that an error warranting resentencing had been made by telling the defendant he would be subject to mandatory prison time. The other alleged errors regarding the involuntary guilty pleas do not seem to be supported by the court, but they were reversed on other grounds due to the first error.

The trial court notified Jordan that he would be  subject to a mandatory period of five years of postrelease control upon his release from prison and that he would be classified as a Tier II sex offender.,,2017,Brady violation,"In his fourth assignment of error, Jordan maintains that his due
process rights were violated when the state failed to disclose Brady material to him. See Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). In his direct appeal, Jordan argued that the prosecutors committed misconduct when they “failed to turn over to the defense information regarding Ladson’s gang and criminal activity.” Jordan, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 106273, 2018-Ohio-4108, ¶ 46. In his petition for postconviction relief, he argues that the state should have disclosed the photos of Ladson evidencing his tattoos and the gang report showing that Ladson was a member of the Heartless Felons. According to Jordan, the same prosecutor who tried his case also tried Ladson’s murder case and admitted these exhibits in Ladson’s criminal cases.",No error,"The trial court found that Jordan’s Brady claim was barred by res judicata and was meritless. After review, we agree with the trial court that Jordan’s claim regarding Ladson’s criminal activity is barred by res judicata. Although the documents establishing Ladson’s criminal gang activity were not before this court in Jordan’s direct appeal, Jordan still argued that the prosecutor should have turned them over to defense counsel. We fully addressed this argument and therefore find that Jordan cannot now raise it in his postconviction petition. We will, however, address Jordan’s claim with respect to the photo exhibits attached to his petition showing that Ladson has tattoos all over his body.

**

Ladson was convicted of murder in June 2016. Jordan’s trial was not until January 2017. The photo exhibits of Ladson’s tattoos were not ones that were wholly within the state’s control because they were part of the public record in Ladson’s criminal trial where the state proved that Ladson was a member of the Heartless Felons and had tattoos on his body indicative of membership in the gang. Therefore, the state was not required to disclose these photos to Jordan.

Moreover, as we explained in the previous assignment of error, the exhibits that Jordan attached to his petition for postconviction relief showing Ladson was “covered” in tattoos, had been convicted of murder, and was a member of the Heartless Felons is not material or exculpatory.","Brady v.

In his third assignment of error, Hemming claims that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. He asserts that his trial counsel should have objected to the prosecutor’s questions to Detective VonHolle regarding his post-arrest silence, the prosecutor’s asking of leading questions during direct examination, and the prosecutor’s use of a visual aid during closing argument.

In his second assignment of error, Hemming claims that the prosecutor engaged in multiple acts of misconduct that deprived him of a fair trial.",Harmless error,"
SECOND ASSIGNMENT:
We find no misconduct in the prosecutor’s use of the “chart” during her closing argument. In this case, the transcript indicates that the prosecutor used the checklist to identify the elements that the State was required to prove, and the prosecutor simply checked those elements as she argued the State had met its burden on each of those elements. The prosecutor did not invite the jury to convict Hemming based on evidence not presented at trial. In short, the prosecutor’s actions did not exceed the latitude afforded a prosecutor during closing argument.

THIRD ASSIGNMENT:
On the record before us, however, we cannot conclude that the outcome of Hemming’s trial would have been different had defense counsel objected to the State’s questions. As to Hemming’s other allegations, the State generally did not ask improper leading questions and the prosecutor did not improperly use a visual aid during closing argument. Accordingly, defense counsel did not act deficiently when she failed to object to those actions.

FOURTH ASSIGNMENT:
Although there was evidence from which the jury could have reached a different verdict, we cannot conclude that the jury lost its way when it apparently credited A.H.’s version of events and found Hemming guilty of sexual imposition as a first-degree misdemeanor.

142-Obermiller,,Fact-check complete,,142,101456,"Court of Appeals of Ohio, Eighth Appellate District",,Ohio,Cuyahoga,,2019-04-04,2019,2019,,,Obermiller,Denny,,,2011,Murder,Aggravated murder,"Theft, kidnapping, aggravated robbery, rape, aggravated burglary, tampering with evidence, attempted aggravated arson, burglary",,,,Sentenced to death with 32.5 years on remaining counts,checked,2011,Brady violation,"{¶11} In the first assigned error, Obermiller argues that R.C. 2953.21 fails to provide meaningful review because res judicata can be applied to bar claims that were not previously raised, and R.C. 2953.21 presents “little opportunity for factual development.” In the third assigned error, Obermiller also argues that because petitioners cannot conduct discovery, there is little opportunity for development of facts to support postconviction claims. Obermiller notes that the Death Penalty Task Force appointed by the Chief Justice of the Ohio Supreme Court and the Ohio State Bar Association issued a final report that includes recommendations on providing for depositions and subpoenas during discovery in postconviction relief, and after his conviction, these recommendations were adopted in the Revised Code.
{¶19} Obermiller next argues that the trial court erred by ruling on the petition and denied it without reconvening the three-judge panel that determined his guilt and sentence.
{¶23} Obermiller next argues that the trial court erred in overruling his second claim for relief, that argues that the death penalty violates international law. In his fourth claim for relief, that the death penalty violates the Constitution of the United States and the Ohio Constitutions.
{¶28} Obermiller next argues that the trial court erred in overruling his fourth claim for relief in which he argues that the foreman of the grand jury that initially indicted him (issuing a 13-count indictment alleging capital murder and other offenses) was African-American, but the foreman of the second grand jury that indicted him (in a 19-count indictment that alleged capital murder and other offenses) was Caucasian, and his conviction is based upon the second indictment.
{¶33} In his sixth assigned error, Obermiller asserts that the trial court erred in denying his sixth claim for relief that asserted a violation of Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), and in denying discovery on this claim. In support of this assigned error, Obermiller argues that the prosecuting attorney’s office “has a history [of] suppressing material evidence,” and other courts have determined that the office “suppressed material evidence in other homicide investigations.” In opposition, the state asserts that this claim is speculative and that it provided Obermiller with “open file” discovery.
{¶37} In the seventh and tenth assigned errors, Obermiller asserts that the trial court erred in denying his claims that he was denied effective assistance of trial counsel during the pretrial, trial, and mitigation phases, and also erred in denying him factual development of these claims.
{¶42} In the eighth assigned error, Obermiller asserts that the trial court erred in denying his claim challenging the voluntariness of his guilty plea. He maintains that he suffered from mental illness so he could not understand the nature of his plea. He also complains that the trial court erred in denying him factual development of this claim.
{¶46} Obermiller next asserts that the trial court erred in rejecting his claim that he lacked competence to waive a mitigation hearing. Specifically, he argues that he had been prescribed Lithium prior to the offenses, but at the time he waived mitigation, he was receiving different medications that impacted his mental state and caused him to waive the presentation of mitigating evidence at trial.
{¶51} In the eleventh assigned error, Obermiller argues that the trial court erred in refusing to grant him relief on his claim of cumulative error.",No error,"{¶17} Here, however, we conclude that the trial court conducted a thorough analysis of each claim and provided Obermiller with a meaningful review of his petition, and under the circumstances of this case, the trial court did not err in denying discovery.
{¶21} The Ketterer court additionally rejected the argument that the Ohio Supreme Court has required reconvening the original panel in State v. Stumpf, 32 Ohio St.3d 95, 512 N.E.2d 598 (1987), State v. Davis, 38 Ohio St.3d 361, 528 N.E.2d 925 (1988), and State v. Filiaggi, 86 Ohio
St.3d 230, 1999-Ohio-99, 714 N.E.2d 867. The Ketterer court found that these cases did not support Ketterer’s argument because they did not involve petitions for postconviction relief.
{¶24} We note that in the direct appeal, the Ohio Supreme Court rejected Obermiller’s various constitutional challenges to the death penalty and rejected the argument that the death penalty violates international law. See Obermiller I, 147 Ohio St.3d 175, at ¶ 111. These claims, and any related claims, are now barred by res judicata. Perry, 10 Ohio St.2d at 181, 226 N.E.2d 104.
{¶31} In this matter, the record is unclear as to how the grand jury foreman was selected, and there has been no evidence that the procedure employed by the county to select the foreperson resulted in substantial underrepresentation of either African-Americans or women on his grand jury or on grand juries over a significant period of time. Obermiller merely asserted
that the first foreman, who presided over the grand jury that issued capital murder charges, was African-American, and the second foreman, who also presided over a grand jury that issued capital charges, was Caucasian. Accordingly, the trial court properly rejected this claim.
{¶35} However, “mere speculation is not sufficient to sustain a Brady claim.” Lang v. Bobby, N.D.Ohio No. 5:12-CV-2923, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS (Mar. 27, 2015), citing Cunningham v. Wenatchee, 345 F.3d 802, 812 (9th Cir.2003). Further, the trial court was not required to examine the prosecutor’s file based on speculation that the prosecutor might have withheld exculpatory evidence. State v. Frazier, 115 Ohio St.3d 139, 2007-Ohio-5048, 873 N.E.2d 1263, ¶ 123, citing State v. Hancock, 108 Ohio St.3d 57, 2006-Ohio-160, 840 N.E.2d
1032, and State v. Hanna, 95 Ohio St.3d 285, 2002-Ohio-2221, 767 N.E.2d 678.
{¶39} In any event, a “defense attorney’s failure to reasonably investigate a
defendant’s background and present mitigating evidence * * * at sentencing can constitute ineffective assistance,” but a petitioner cannot establish prejudice resulting from counsel’s failure to conduct a thorough investigation when the petitioner refuses to allow the presentation of any
mitigating evidence at the sentencing hearing. Henness v. Bagley, 644 F.3d 308, 323 (6th Cir.2011), citing Schriro v. Landrigan, 550 U.S. 465, 476-477, 127 S.Ct. 1933, 167 L.Ed.2d 836 (2007). Accord Coleman v. Mitchell, 244 F.3d 533, 545 (6th Cir.2001) (“An attorney’s conduct is not deficient simply for following his client’s instructions.”).
{¶43} In his direct appeal, Obermiller maintained that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress and that this ruling “tainted his decision to plead guilty to the charges against him.” Obermiller I, 147 Ohio St.3d 175, at ¶ 54. The Ohio Supreme Court specifically noted that “Obermiller has not challenged his guilty plea on appeal.” Id. at ¶ 56. Accordingly, this
claim, although not explicitly raised in the direct appeal, could have been raised, and it is therefore barred by res judicata.
{¶50} Moreover, our review of the record demonstrates that the state’s expert, Dr. Phillip Resnick, provided the court with a detailed report outlining Obermiller’s history of substance abuse and psychiatric history. Dr. Resnick also “systematically screened Mr. Obermiller for current symptoms of depression, mania * * *, psychosis * * *, posttraumatic stress disorder * * *,
and anxiety disorders[.]” Additionally, Dr. Resnick determined that Obermiller had “insight into his current situation and [h]is judgment was fair based upon his response to hypothetical situations.” Obermiller did not have delusions or hallucinations. Dr. Resnick also remarked that Obermiller “never changed or regretted his decision to plead guilty,” his decision to waive mitigation was “firm,” and he has “never changed in his desire to receive a death sentence.” Dr. Resnick was fully qualified to evaluate whether Obermiller’s prescription medications would have affected his competency. Accord State v. Mink, 101 Ohio St.3d 350, 2004-Ohio-1580, 805 N.E.2d 1064, ¶ 30-34. Therefore, this assigned error lacks merit.
{¶52} Under the doctrine of cumulative error, a conviction will be reversed when the cumulative effect of errors in a trial deprives a defendant of the constitutional right to a fair trial even though each of the errors does not individually constitute cause for reversal. State v. Hunter, 131 Ohio St.3d 67, 2011-Ohio-6524, 960 N.E.2d 955, ¶ 132; State v. Garner, 74 Ohio St.3d 49, 64, 1995-Ohio-168, 656 N.E.2d 623. However, the doctrine of cumulative error is inapplicable when the alleged errors are found to be harmless or nonexistent. Id.; State v. Brown, 100 Ohio St.3d 51, 2003-Ohio-5059, 796 N.E.2d 506, ¶ 48.","Brady v. Maryland,prosecutorial misconduct",Patricia Ann Blackmon,,"Anita Laster Mays, Larry A. Jones",,Michael C.

Second Assignment of Error: The trial court committed reversible error in failing to find that the statements by the officers contained in the Affidavit offered to procure the warrant, when the statements containing material omissions of fact and material statements of factual impossibility, were sufficient to create probable cause to allow for the issuance of a warrant to search Mr. Riffle’s premises.
Third Assignment of Error: Mr. Riffle was prejudiced by the ineffective assistance of trial counsel in that Trial Counsel failed to raise the issue of a Brady violation for a failure of the State of Ohio to ever provide a copy of the email containing the “tip” from the confidential informant accusing Mr. Riffle of criminal activity.
Fourth Assignment of Error: Appellant’s trial counsel was ineffective in failing to file a motion in limine with regards to the introduction of seven (7) firearms into evidence and the trial court committed clear error in allowing the presentation and introduction of the seven (7) rifles as evidence into trial when it is established before the hearing that operability has not been established.
Fifth Assignment of Error: The numerous errors and ineffective acts throughout the trial process, while providing grounds for reversal of Mr. Riffle’s conviction by themselves, also provide grounds for reversal as their cumulative nature resulted in a deprivation of Mr. Riffle’s due process right to a fair trial.",No error,"18 Because the officers would have inevitably discovered the marijuana
and firearms pursuant to the valid search warrant, Riffle was not prejudiced by trial counsel’s failure to file a motion to suppress. Thus, Riffle’s first assignment of error is overruled.
22 Failure to raise a Brady violation where the state did not provide
information pertaining to an anonymous tip did not constitute ineffective counsel. Therefore, Riffle’s third assignment of error is overruled.

26 Riffle also avers trial counsel was ineffective when he did not file a
motion in limine preventing the introduction and presentation to the jury of seven confiscated weapons. Defense counsel did not file a motion in limine, but engaged in a discussion with the prosecutor and the judge, prior to trial, and objected to the introduction of firearms on the grounds that they were prejudicial. We find the introduction and presentation of the guns did not prejudice the defense so as to deprive Riffle of a fair trial. 

The fact that Riffle was found not guilty of drug trafficking indicates the jury was not prejudiced by the introduction of the firearms and decided the case on its merits. Because Riffle cannot satisfy the second prong of the Strickland test, we need not address the first prong.
34 The search warrant affidavit presented probable cause to support the
issuance of a search warrant. The trial court did not err in overruling Riffle’s motion to suppress and, as a result, appellant’s second assignment of error is overruled.
35 In his final assignment of error, Riffle argues the cumulative effect of
all the errors in his trial deprived him of his constitutional right to a fair trial.
Because we found no merit to his first four assignments of error, Riffle’s fifth
assignment of error is overruled.

On appeal, Davis contends that the trial court abused its discretion
when it assumed manifest necessity and declared a mistrial, thus violating his
constitutional right against double jeopardy. He contends that neither he nor the
state requested a mistrial and that his request to proceed pro se was untimely and,
thus, should not have been a basis for granting a mistrial. Davis’s arguments are
without merit.

27. Jury Instructions

In his second and third assignments of error, Davis contends that the
trial court erred in its instructions to the jury. Specially, he contends that a flight
instruction was not appropriate and that the court should have instructed the jury
on self-defense.

39. In this case, Davis denied that he created the situation or committed
any offense. Accordingly, a claim of self-defense is contradictory to his defense of
actual innocence.",,"26.In this case, even if we were to find that the trial court erred in
declaring a mistrial, it is apparent that Davis’s actions and assertions were the
precipitating events that caused the mistrial; thus, it could be viewed as invited error. The record demonstrates that Davis was unequivocal in his request to dismiss his attorneys during trial and represent himself. The court noted that some of his protestations occurred in the presence of the jury, which could have tainted their perspective and led to an unfair trial. Davis cannot take advantage of the error that he in fact induced. Accordingly, Davis’s first assignment of error is overruled.


33. Despite the trial court’s error, we cannot say, nor has Davis
demonstrated, that the error was prejudicial such that a manifest miscarriage of
justice has occurred. Reviewing the instruction as a whole, it allowed the jury to
reach its own conclusions on the issue of flight, including whether Davis actually fled the scene, and Davis’s motivation for leaving the scene. Under similar
circumstances, this court has declined to find plain error. See, e.g., Jackson and
Johnson. We likewise decline to find plain error here. Davis’s second assignment
of error is overruled.

40. Moreover, any claim that the gun accidentally discharged is also
contrary to a theory of self-defense. See State v. Johnson, 10th Dist. Franklin No.
06AP-878, 2007-Ohio-2792, ¶42-43 (defendant’s testimony that the firearm
discharged as a result of a struggle for the firearm and not as a result of his
intentional and willful act contradicted the application of self-defense). We note
that the jury found Davis not guilty of attempted murder and felonious assault with a deadly weapon. Accordingly, insofar as the self-defense instruction was requested involving the discharge of the firearm, the denial of the instruction was not prejudicial. Davis’s third assignment of error is overruled.","Oregon v. Kennedy,prosecutorial misconduct",KATHLEEN ANN KEOUGH,,"MARY J. BOYLE, A.J., and
EILEEN A. GALLAGHER, J., CONCUR",,Michael C. O’Malley,Michael C. O'Malley,"The allegations were a result of multiple trials with flight of the defendent. However, the reasoning of the court was clear throughout that there was no error as there was no sufficient evident to uphold the arguments of the appeal as with comparisions with other cases, it did not meet the requirements particularly with mistrial and jury instructions. The views of the jury were not altered after the instructions.

Ferricci asserts that the jury’s ultimate factual determinations in the acquittal for
kidnapping for the purpose of engaging in sexual activity with a sexual motivation specification preclude retrial on the rape charge. In opposition, the state argues that issue preclusion bars only what a jury actually decided in the prior acquittal and that the jury did not actually decide facts that preclude relitigation of the rape charge. The state maintains that the jury acquitted Ferricci of kidnapping due to failure of evidence of restraint or removal.

",Did not reach prejudice/ is error but reverses on other grounds,"8. The failure of the jury to reach a verdict is not an event that terminates jeopardy.

20. Therefore, we conclude that in acquitting Ferricci of kidnapping, it was not
essential for the jury to have concluded that no sexual conduct occurred. The occurrence or nonoccurrence of sexual conduct was not “necessarily decided” and was not “a critical issue of ultimate fact” in light of the kidnapping acquittal.

21. Ferricci argues that retrial of the rape charge is barred by Madsen v. McFaul, 643 F. Supp.2d 962 (N.D.Ohio 2009). However, due to its unique procedural history, Madsen is inapposite to this matter. In Madsen, the defendant was indicted for eight carbon-copy counts of rape, one count of kidnapping, one count of domestic violence, and one count of aggravated robbery. The trial court dismissed the domestic violence charge, the jury acquitted him of two of the rape charges, but he was convicted of six rape counts and the kidnapping counts. At
sentencing, the trial court merged the rape and kidnapping convictions, concluding that “there was no separate restraint.” Id. at 970. Later, the convictions were vacated and the state was given 120 days in which to retry Madsen. Madsen filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that retrial was barred by double jeopardy. The court ruled that the carbon-copy nature of the rape charges resulted in an effective acquittal on all eight rape charges. The court also held that double jeopardy barred retrial on the kidnapping charge, in light of the prior merger and absence
of other evidence pertaining to restraint. This case, however, does not include the prior merger of any offenses and does not involve “carbon copy” allegations among the charges.

As in prior motions, Mr. Boware alleged the State withheld exculpatory evidence about the State’s witness, including that the State’s witness was allegedly a “confidential informant” and “prostitute,” and the Akron police did not preserve “apparently exculpatory crime scene rape [] DNA evidence,” thus creating a Brady violation. See Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S.83 (1963). Mr. Boware also claimed the victim, P.W., filed a false police report in 1993 indicating he had “fondled her breasts.”",,"Indeed, the above-listed documents were available to Mr. Boware for purposes of direct appeal or post-conviction relief.

Jarrett,Boaston,Ronald,Ronald Boaston,Black,2015,Murder,Murder,,checked,,Female,15 years to Life,,2015,Brady violation,"Procedural History: 
First, Boaston claimed that the state violated Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S.
83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), by failing to disclose material evidence favorable to him when it presented Dr. Scala-Barnett’s time-of-death opinion and glove-buckle opinion without Dr. Scala-Barnett including those opinions in her written report, as required by Crim.R. 16(K). He argued that his defense was prejudiced because it was “impossible” for any expert hired by trial counsel “to conduct a true expert analysis consisting of a scientific reasoning process * * *” without knowing what Dr. Scala-Barnett’s “reasoning process” was. He claimed that this resulted in him being “ambushed in trial,” and that due process required that he be given an opportunity in a postconviction relief proceeding to have an expert pathologist review Dr. Scala-Barnett’s conclusions.

Assignments of Error: 
{¶ 45} In his first assignment of error, Boaston argues that the trial court erred by
dismissing his postconviction relief petition without holding an evidentiary hearing because the state committed a Brady violation by failing to provide a written report of Dr. Scala-Barnett’s time-of-death opinion and glove-buckle opinion before trial and he received ineffective assistance of counsel because trial counsel failed to appropriately respond to being “ambushed” by Dr. Scala-Barnett’s unwritten opinions and did not call an expert to contradict Gast’s cell tower testimony. He argues that his claims are not barred by res judicata because they rely on evidence outside of the record, and that his petition “clearly contained enough factual matter challenging the State’s key evidence and demonstrating the constitutional violations suffered by Boaston in how that evidence was presented.” Ultimately, he contends, his petition “was not so meritless to warrant dismissing it without a full evidentiary hearing to test the ultimate substance to [his] claims.”",,"{¶ 48} Boaston first argues that his right to due process was violated when the state failed to disclose Dr. Scala-Barnett’s time-of-death opinion. Because he could have raised this issue in his direct appeal, we find that it is barred by res judicata.

{¶ 50} Here, Boaston and his trial counsel clearly knew about the state’s belated disclosure of Dr. Scala-Barnett’s time-of-death opinion and glove-buckle opinion (and the state’s complete failure to provide Boaston with a written report of those opinions, as required by Crim.R. 16(K)) at the time of trial. But Boaston did not pursue the issue of a Brady violation in his direct appeal,3 and his postconviction relief petition did not include any new evidence outside of the record related to the alleged Brady violation. Therefore, his Brady claim is precluded by res judicata. We find that this argument is without merit.

Boaston had previously appealed his case to the Supreme Court of Ohio, alleging errors in admitting improper witness testimony. The Supreme Court held that it was harmless error. In trial court appeal, Boaston claims a Brady violation because it presented at trial evidence that was not included in the expert's written report. The trial court denied Boaston's appeal, finding that Boaston failed to show that evidence was material and exculpatory.

This appeal now is related to Boaston appealing the trial courts ruling saying that the court erred in dismissing his motion without an evidentiary hearing, and by not allowing for funds for Boaston to hire an expert witness.

basis of false or misleading information and an abuse of grand jury by the prosecution, as well as prosecutorial misconduct during the course of the pre trial and trial adjudications, the net effect of which permeated the entire course of the proceedings in the trial court including but not limited to the following appeals on remand, and following the guilty plea, conviction and sentence. ",,"Feathers also contends the domestic violence offense “was not presented to
the grand jury with the facts that were based on the alleged charges.” This appears to be based on his assertion that facts presented at his 2005 trial established a different location of the offenses than the indictment. This argument is somewhat unclear since the indictment does not state the specific location of the domestic violence offense except to indicate that
it occurred in Portage County. Nonetheless, to the extent that Feathers attempts to raise issues with the evidence presented at trial, we emphasize that the convictions resulting from that trial were reversed and Feathers chose to enter a guilty plea to each of the charges in the amended indictment. There are no grounds to compare the facts presented at a trial to those presented to the grand jury. Similarly, to the extent Feathers appears to raise an issue with venue and jurisdiction relating to the location of the offenses, as noted above, the indictment alleged that the offenses occurred in Portage County and Feathers entered a plea of guilty under this indictment in the proper venue of the Portage County Court of Common Pleas.",prosecutorial misconduct,Cynthia Westcott Rice,Cynthia Westcott Rice,Thomas R.

Moreover, as it relates to Gibson's fourth assignment of error alleging the state acted fraudulently when it filed a false and/or misleading memorandum regarding the proposed testimony of his expert witness, Dr. Lowenstein, Gibson has not provided any evidence to prove the state actually engaged in such misconduct. Gibson has also failed to provide any evidence to show how the state's alleged misconduct contributed to the trial court's purported bias against him, as well as any prejudice resulting from the state's alleged
misconduct. This is because, as the record indicates, Gibson was free to argue against the state's position before the trial court, just as he does to this court on appeal. The same rationale would apply to Gibson's arguments advanced under his second and third assignments of error, one of which involves a substantially similar argument wherein Gibson alleges the state submitted ""false, fraudulent documents with the intent to mislead the court, with complete success.""",prosecutorial misconduct,S.

Rizzo,Jackson,Dennis Devone,Dennis Devone Jackson,Black,2011,Murder,Murder,"Aggravated burglary, aggravated robbery, and a firearm specification",,,Male,28 years to life,,,"Discovery,Brady violation"," In his supporting memorandum, Jackson asserted that the State had failed
to obtain a search warrant before obtaining “his call detail records containing Cell Site Location Information (“CSLI”)” and used the information from his phone records to obtain his conviction. Citing the testimony of Detective Pigman at trial, Jackson asserted that Exhibit 01 had not been “part of discovery” and that the exhibit established that “a search and seizure ha[d] taken place.” According to Jackson, disclosure of the phone records in discovery would have allowed trial counsel to review the phone records and to recall witnesses “to challenge their credibility, as to their actual locations during this crime.”
Jackson argued that the State used these phone records to place him in the vicinity of the crime, “which weighed heavily on the minds of the jurors.”
{¶ 6} Jackson also attached his own affidavit, in which he averred that the State had conducted an illegal search and seizure of his Cincinnati Bell Wireless phone records and had failed to provide documents related to that search (namely, the order requiring Cincinnati Bell Wireless to provide the records to the Trotwood Police Department) in its discovery. Jackson also averred that the State “conducted long term monitoring/tracking” of him for more than 22 days and that it obtained the phone records without a warrant. Further, Jackson asserted in his affidavit that the State withheld the phone records in violation of Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). According to Jackson, the State’s disclosure of the phone records for the first time on the last day of trial “present[ed] an irregularity of proceedings” and a “surprise which ordinary prudence could not have guarded against,” and the State’s misconduct required that the phone records be suppressed and a new trial ordered.

to Correct an Illegal/Void Sentence” and his May 26, 2020, motion for leave to supplement that motion. The court treated the motions as seeking postconviction relief and concluded that such relief was barred by res judicata. (The trial court’s judgment on these matters is on appeal in a separate case, Montgomery App. No. 29001.) The same day, the court overruled Jackson’s December 26, 2017, motion asking the court to
reconsider its previous decision overruling his “renewed motion to dismiss” and his January 11, 2018, motion for a new trial and renewed motion for acquittal. The court determined that the relief Jackson sought was similar to the relief sought in his previous motions before the court, which had already been overruled, and that he had presented no new or additional information for the court to consider. 

Actual holding:

¶ 26} The trial court properly determined that Jackson “presented no new
additional information” for the trial court to consider, since Jackson had previously argued
that the Cincinnati Bell cellular phone records had been obtained illegally and had not
been timely disclosed. As such, res judicata barred his arguments.

We disagree.",Did not reach prejudice/ is error but reverses on other grounds,"But, assuming without deciding that the trial court erred in permitting this
testimony, Mr. Lewis cannot establish plain error because he has not demonstrated that he was unfairly prejudiced as a result of the testimony. See State v. Knight, 9th Dist. Wayne No.15AP0019, 2016-Ohio-8505, ¶ 14. See also State v. Rogers, 143 Ohio St.3d 385, 2015-Ohio-2459, ¶ 22 (addressing the plain-error standard and stating that “[t]he accused is * * * required to
demonstrate a reasonable probability that the error resulted in prejudice * * *.” (Emphasis sic.)).
First, we note that the jury did not have to believe any of the testimony regarding the electronic messages to find Mr. Lewis guilty of unlawful sexual conduct with a minor. The jury only had to find beyond a reasonable doubt that (1) Mr. Lewis engaged in fellatio with K.F. and (2) he either knew K.F. was between 13 and 15 years old or was reckless in that regard. Furthermore, our
review of the record reveals that the State introduced overwhelming evidence supporting the jury’s guilty verdict in this matter, and Mr. Lewis has not challenged the sufficiency or weight of this evidence on appeal. The State’s evidence included: (1) K.F.’s testimony that she performed fellatio on Mr. Lewis; (2) Y.F.’s testimony that Mr. Lewis attended K.F.’s birthday parties and
knew her age; (3) testimony that Mr. Lewis admitted the fellatio incident to both Y.F. and E.M.; and (4) an audio recording in which Mr. Lewis admitted that K.F. performed fellatio on him and that he knew it was wrong and could have stopped it but did not. Altogether, this wealth of evidence was more than enough to convict Mr. Lewis of unlawful sexual conduct with a minor, even if the testimony concerning electronic messages had been excluded. Mr. Lewis has therefore failed to demonstrate plain error because he has not demonstrated that the outcome of the trial would have been different had the testimony been excluded.

aggravated menacing following a bench trial in the Dayton Municipal Court. In support of his appeal, Wilcoxson argues that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to move for a trial continuance and by failing to file a timely jury demand. Wilcoxson also contends that he was denied his constitutional right to due process as a result of the State’s failure to provide certain video evidence in discovery. For the reasons outlined below, the judgment of the trial court will be affirmed. ",No error,"Similarly, any surveillance video footage taken from businesses surrounding the laundromat would have only shown Wilcoxson’s altercation outside with Brewer. 

Wilcoxson’s and Wagner’s testimony both indicate that Wilcoxson threatened Wagner while they were inside the laundromat. Wilcoxson himself testified that Wagner was not outside the laundromat for much of the event. Therefore, surveillance footage taken from neighboring businesses would not have aided either party’s case with regard to the aggravated menacing and menacing charges. Accordingly, Wilcoxson was not prejudiced by the State’s failure to obtain that video footage either.
{¶ 44} Because Wilcoxson was not prejudiced by the lack of video evidence at issue, we find no due process violation. The record indicates that Wilcoxson received a fair trial that resulted in a verdict worthy of confidence despite the absent video footage. We also find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it decided to proceed with trial, as the trial court reasonably determined that the video footage would not have corroborated either party’s version of the relevant events.

In his second proposition of law, Lawson contends that both his jury
waiver and his subsequent guilty pleas were invalid because they were not knowing, voluntary, and intelligent. This proposition essentially restates the claims made in his first proposition of law; the same three circumstances that the first proposition calls “indicia of incompetence” are here relied upon as reasons to question the knowing, voluntary, and intelligent character of his jury waiver and guilty pleas. Lawson also argues that before accepting his waiver and pleas, the trial court should have advised him that a single juror could prevent a death sentence.

In his third proposition of law, Lawson contends that his trial counsel
rendered ineffective assistance.

In his fourth proposition of law, Lawson contends that errors in the
panel’s sentencing opinion require that we vacate his death sentences. He contends that the panel improperly weighed nonstatutory aggravating circumstances against him and improperly discounted the mitigating factors.

Lawson’s fifth proposition of law raises various oft-rejected
arguments against the constitutionality of the death penalty and the Ohio statutes governing its imposition and also raises similar arguments that the death penalty violates international law.

SECOND ERROR: Appellant argues that “the newly discovered evidence analyzed in the context of and upon consideration of all available admissible evidence related to [appellant’s] case, establishes his actual innocence.”

THIRD ERROR: Appellant argues that the state violated his due process through a violation of Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963) by not informing him prior to trial that the state’s DNA test results proved that he could not have been the rapist (“Brady violation”).",,"

not give false testimony regarding the DNA results and their relation to
appellant’s guilt. Therefore, the state argues that the memo is not new evidence, and that res judicata precludes our consideration of appellant’s successive petition on this issue.

FIRST ERROR: PAGE 8 {¶8} Appellant argues that the memo conflicts with Tejwani’s testimony that the DNA test results were “inconclusive” regarding appellant (i.e., the test results could not include or exclude appellant as having contributed to the DNA) because appellant’s blood contains only the A gene at the D7S8 marker, and therefore “conclusively established that [appellant] was not the second rapist.” Appellant alleges that “Tejwani understood [appellant was not the second rapist]; and her memo directly contradicted her trial testimony.”
{¶9} Finally, appellant argues that any assertion by the state - that
appellant’s trial was not decided on the DNA evidence, but was supported by
other circumstantial evidence - is undermined by the fact that in 2009 Dunn
recanted his testimony that implicated appellant in committing the criminal
offenses at issue herein. Appellant claims that this recantation also is supported by a newly discovered police report in which the lead detective and state determined that Dunn’s incriminating statements were not credible.

SECOND ERROR: N/A

THIRD ERROR: PAGE 22 {¶44}Appellant asserted a Brady violation in the direct appeal of his conviction alleging that “the state failed to disclose the existence of the ‘B’ DNA gene discovered in the semen sample taken from the victim.” Hatton, 4th Dist. Pickaway No. 97CA34, 1999 WL 253450, at *20 (Apr. 19, 1999). Appellant claimed that ‘[t]his finding established beyond doubt that someone other than the victim, Dunn[,] or [a]ppellant contributed to the sample.’ ” Id. We overruled that assignment of error finding

COURT RULING:
FIRST ERROR: PAGE 15+16 {¶25} In addressing appellant’s 1998 petition for post-conviction relief, the trial court found that Davis’ affidavit provided “no new and material evidence[.]” “Dr. Davis’s affidavit clearly states that everything she reviewed and based her opinion upon was submitted and used as evidence during [appellant’s] trial. The only thing ‘new’ being submitted is Dr. Davis’s opinion, or  interpretation, of the evidence already presented at trial.” The trial court also found that Lehmkuhl’s affidavit did not refute other evidence in support of appellant’s conviction, including the victim’s father who caught Dunn and testified that Dunn implicated appellant by first and last name as being a co-defendant. Thus, the trial court found that appellant’s petition was barred by res judicata and dismissed his petition.

SECOND ERROR: PAGE 20+21 {¶38} Similar to our analysis in appellant’s first assignment of error, we find that Tejwani’s memo does not contain “facts” that were unavailable to him, and upon which he had to rely in filing his petition herein. Therefore, appellant’s petition herein is also barred by res judicata because “ ‘[r]es judicata does not * * * apply only to direct appeals, but to all postconviction proceedings in which an issue was or could have been raised.’ 
{¶39} Accordingly, because appellant’s petition for post-conviction relief is
barred by res judicata, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellant’s petition without a hearing. Therefore, we overrule appellant’s second assignment of error.

THIRD ERROR: PAGE 21 {¶41} The state argues that the Brady issue has been previously litigated by this court.

to prosecutorial misconduct and where he was tried, convicted, and

was presented by prosecutors to intentionally circumvent the defenses
to the actually indicted alleged crimes.
Supporting Facts: When Petitioner established that he did not commit
the indicted crimes, prosecutors mid-trial changed not only the date
range of the indictment to circumvent the defense but then changed the
locations to completely different locations after Petitioner established
that he could not have committed the indicted alleged crimes because
by the newly argued time frame Petitioner had never been to the
locations where the alleged victims claimed initially claimed the
assaults were supposedly committed. As Petitioner was able to present
facts to defend the accusations, prosecutors simply kept amending the
indictment and bill of particulars throughout trial. Prosecutors
continuously inserted allegations that were never disclosed, never
indicted, or charged and allegations they confirmed in trial they never
heard of until two weeks into trial. At one point in trial prosecutors
advised the court and defense counsel that Petitioner would not have to
defend a certain charge and later, after failing to present evidence on

particular, the State is under no obligation to call as a witness the law enforcement officer designated as the State’s representative at trial, so an objection to that effect by trial counsel would have been meritless. It is extremely risky for the defense to call the State’s representative as a
defense witness because defense counsel cannot know what he or she will say.

confrontation and Fourteenth Amendment due process rights when it admitted into evidence some of co-defendant Bates’s “extrajudicial” interview.42 Defendant argues that admitting
part of Bates’s interview during FBI Agent Earl’s examination, when Bates was not called to testify, violated his confrontation right, as well as his rights to a defense and fair trial.

But the government did not admit any part of Bates’s interview. Defendant references a line of questioning that the Court cutoff to avoid a potential confrontation issue. Defendant’s counsel also cross-examined FBI Agent Earl on the Bates interview issue to protect Montgomery’s rights. Defendant Montgomery has not shown that his rights were violated because of this particular questioning.

---------
Next, Defendant Montgomery argues that the Government violated his constitutional rights by “eliciting damaging inferential hearsay testimony” during FBI Agent Earl’s examination and committing “prosecutorial misconduct during closing argument.”52 Montgomery also alleges that the Government’s prosecutor went beyond the appropriate scope of his closing argument rebuttal. Montgomery says the prosecutor “urge[d] the jury to consider [Montgomery’s] bad character as a thumb on the scale in favor of finding guilt.”53",No error,"there is little to suggest that the prosecutor’s actions were improper. As
discussed above, the Court stopped the Government from eliciting hearsay testimony during FBI Agent Earl’s examination. As for the Government’s closing argument and rebuttal closing, neither demean Montgomery’s character.

Moreover, the Court stopped the prosecutor from going beyond the scope of defense counsel’s closing argument.Even if Defendant had met the first prong of the two-part standard, he does not meet the second. Considering the four factors, the prosecutor’s comments were not misleading. 
Further, the strength of the other evidence against Defendant, the Court’s efforts to limit the government’s rebuttal scope, and the isolated nature of the prosecutor’s comments within the context of the entire trial counter Defendant’s claims of a constitutional violation.

four assignments of error for our review:
I. Mr. Jones was convicted with insufficient evidence and his
conviction was against the weight of the evidence in violation of both the
Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I, sec.
14 of the Ohio Constitution.
II. The Trial Court errored in violation of the Fourth Amendment to
the U.S. Constitution and Article I, Section 14 of the Ohio Constitution
when it failed to suppress the evidence allegedly removed from the vehicle
Mr. Jones was driving.
III. The Trial Court errored to the prejudice of Mr. Jones in giving a
Consciousness of Guilt Jury Instruction without supporting evidence for it.
IV. The Trial Court errored to the prejudice of Mr. Jones when it
permitted the State to Submit testimony of a prior conviction and the
judgment entry of that conviction in violation of the Due Process Clause of
both the U.S. and Ohio Constitutions.",,"Upon review, we find that competent and credible evidence exists to
support the trial court’s implied factual finding that appellant’s vehicle went over the double yellow line. Brotherton testified that he while he was following appellant’s van, he observed the violation. Lewis also testified that he observed the violation, and that he and Brotherton were following appellant from a distance of about four to five car lengths. We find that four to five car lengths is a short enough distance for an officer to be able to
observe a marked lanes violation. Therefore, we defer to the trial court’s factual findings, and hold that the initial stop of appellant’s van was constitutional because Brotherton had probable cause to believe that appellant had committed a traffic violation.

Thus, in light of the totality of the circumstances, we hold that Lewis diligently completed the records check and written warning, and we conclude that the 18-minute stop was not unreasonable....Therefore, we hold that the length of the stop prior to the K9 unit’s alert did not violate appellant’s constitutional rights.

Accordingly, because appellant’s constitutional rights were not violated
during the stop or search of his vehicle, we hold that the trial court did not err in denying appellant’s motion to suppress. Appellant’s second assignment of error is not well-taken as it pertains to the trial court’s denial of his motion to suppress.

Accordingly, appellant’s second assignment of error is not well-taken as it
pertains to the trial court’s denial of his attempt to call multiple witnesses to challenge Brotherton’s character for truthfulness.

Therefore, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it gave the jury instruction on consciousness of guilt.

Accordingly, because appellant’s conviction is not based upon insufficient
evidence, nor is it against the manifest weight of the evidence, appellant’s first
assignment of error is not well-taken.

Accordingly, appellant’s fourth assignment of error is not well-taken.",harmless error,"PIETRYKOWSKI, J.",,"Gene A. Zmuda, P.J.

excluding evidence of K.K.'s prior inconsistent statement to the Hamilton detectives, we find no merit to his arguments and overrule his first assignment of error.

For the reasons stated above, we find no error, plain or otherwise, in the trial
court's admission of Exhibit 21. The text messages were relevant and admissible. See Blake at ¶ 24-35; State v. Norris, 2d Dist. Clark No. 2015-CA-22, 2016-Ohio-5729, ¶ 27-44. Young's second assignment of error is therefore overruled.

Accordingly, having found no error in the trial court's evidentiary rulings, the
court's consideration of the text messages in determining Young's guilt, or prejudicial error in the court's failure to record the August 9, 2017 and September 13, 2017 hearings on the state's motion in limine regarding character evidence and rape-shield matters, we conclude that Young was not deprived of a fair trial and that the cumulative error doctrine is inapplicable. Young's third assignment of error is overruled.

Accordingly, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying
Young's first motion for new trial as Young has failed to show he was prejudiced by defense counsel's failure to discover the Snapchat photograph prior to trial. Young's claim of an irregularity in the proceedings entitling him to a new trial under Crim.R. 33(A)(1) fails. Young's fourth assignment of error is, therefore, overruled.","Brady v.

C. ""That Ohio’s postconviction procedures do not provide for adequate review and relief from trial error, and this makes his conviction and sentence void or voidable.""

Gregoire further asserts that the retroactive application of the ten-year look-back period amounts to an unconstitutional ex post facto law in violation of the United States and Ohio Constitutions. Judge Piper J. Concurs. However Judge S. Powell dissents citing that he does not find that the statute impacts a vested right. Consequently, I would find the statute constitutional as applied and affirm the trial court. He found that the statute does not impose new ""duties or ""obligations"" upon Gregoire. The statute does not impose a new penalty or increase the prior penalties imposed for any of Gregoire's past OVI convictions. It does not impose new driving restrictions. It does not require him to take any additional actions based upon his past conduct. The effect of the statute is that he simply ceased to qualify for limited driving privileges after the effective date of the act.

Myers does not assert he learned about the prosecutor's social media posts after filing his direct appeal. Nor does he allege the posts were not known or available at the time of trial or his direct appeal. Dillingham, 2012-Ohio-5841 at ¶ 10.
{¶ 81} Myers' seventh assignment of error is overruled.","prosecutorial misconduct,prosecutor misconduct","Hendrickson, P.J.",,"S. Powell, J. ",,David P. Fornshell,,"{¶ 71} Myers argues the trial court erred in summarily denying Grounds 50 and 58 of his PCR petition which allege prosecutorial misconduct.
{¶ 72} For a conviction to be reversed on the basis of prosecutorial misconduct, a defendant must prove the prosecutor's comments were improper and that they prejudicially affected the defendant's substantial rights. State v. Elmore, 111 Ohio St.3d 515, 2006- Ohio-6207, ¶ 62; McKelton, 2015-Ohio-4228 at ¶ 13. However, ""[t]he focus of an inquiry into allegations of prosecutorial misconduct is upon the fairness of the trial, not upon culpability of the prosecutor."" State v. Gray, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2011-09-176, 2012- Ohio-4769, ¶ 56. Therefore, ""[p]rosecutorial misconduct is not grounds for error unless the defendant has been denied a fair trial."" State v. Olvera-Guillen, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2007-05-118, 2008-Ohio-5416, ¶ 27, citing State v. Maurer, 15 Ohio St.3d 239 (1984).
{¶ 73} We first address Myers' averment that ""the late and questionable disclosure of Mosley's notebook may very well have been the result of prosecutorial misconduct.""
{¶ 74} R.C. 2953.21(A)(4) requires a petitioner to ""state in the original or amended petition filed under division (A) of this section all grounds for relief claimed by the petitioner."" Except as provided in R.C. 2953.23, inapplicable here, ""any ground for relief that is not so
stated in the petition is waived."" R.C. 2953.21(A)(4); State v. Lawrence, 12th Dist. Butler Nos. CA2017-06-078 and CA2019-03-048, 2020-Ohio-855, ¶ 17. Myers did not raise this claim of prosecutorial misconduct in his PCR petition and has therefore forfeited it. State v. Zeune, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 13AP-147, 2013-Ohio-4156, ¶ 30; State v. Barb, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 94054, 2010-Ohio-5239, ¶ 25; State v. McKee, 9th Dist. Lorain No. 96CA006599, 1997 Ohio App. LEXIS 4433, *9 (Oct. 1, 1997) (failure to raise issue in PCR petition results in a waiver of the right to assert the issue on appeal).
{¶ 75} Ground 50 alleges that Myers' due process rights were violated when privileged attorney-client discussions were potentially broadcast throughout the courthouse and into the prosecutor's office via the trial court's audio/video recording system. In his brief, Myers asserts the fact that conversations from the defense table could be broadcast in such a manner should cause ""great concern about whether any privileged conversations were 'overheard,' whether any were recorded, whether someone took notes of what they heard, [and] whether such information was utilized by the State in any fashion[.]""
{¶ 76} Myers does not identify the resulting prejudice. The trial court sua sponte addressed the issue at a pretrial hearing in August 2014, subsequently conducted an evaluation of its audio/video recording system to make sure that conversations taking place at the defense table could not be heard by others, and provided a copy of that evaluation to counsel. In dismissing Ground 50, the trial court found ""NO evidence that any conversation of counsel was ever overheard,"" noted its investigation into the issue, and ""determined that the mute button was sufficient to prevent anyone from overhearing any conversation between counsel and the petitioner."" Furthermore, this issue could have been raised on direct appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court and is therefore barred by res judicata. The trial court did not err in dismissing Ground 50.
{¶ 77} Ground 58 alleges that the elected prosecutor engaged in misconduct by
extensively posting about the case on his county prosecutor Facebook and Twitter accounts
during and after the trial and via statements he made in an interview during a 2016 BBC documentary. Ground 58 further alleges that Myers was prejudiced by the prosecutor's misconduct. The trial court dismissed the ground, finding that Myers ""failed to establish sufficient operative facts to establish substantive grounds for relief."" In his brief, Myers asserts that the prosecutor's social media postings and interview ""tainted"" his right to a fair trial.
{¶ 78} We find that the trial court did not err in dismissing Ground 58. The prosecutor's post-trial social media posts, post-trial media statements, and statements in the 2016 BBC documentary are irrelevant and could not and did not deprive Myers of a fair trial. Regarding the prosecutor's social media postings and statements that occurred before and during trial, Myers does not articulate how any specific post or media statement prejudiced his right to a fair trial. A review of the posts and statements shows that they were restricted to providing the public with information about the criminal proceedings against Myers and communicated the results of various stages of the criminal proceedings against Myers either directly or by sharing links to news headlines. Following the guilty verdict, the prosecutor simply recognized Back's family and the efforts of the investigators and his office.
{¶ 79} Furthermore, the trial court repeatedly admonished the jurors not to view or listen to any news reports in any form. We presume the jury followed the trial court's admonitions unless it is demonstrated otherwise. State v. Miller, 12th Dist. Preble No. CA2019-11-010, 2021-Ohio-162, ¶ 50. Myers has not introduced any evidence to the contrary. Prejudice to a defendant will not be presumed in the absence of proof of jury exposure to possibly prejudicial news reports, or in this case, the prosecutor's social media posts. See State v. Wright, 3d Dist. Crawford No. 3-92-24, 1994 Ohio App. LEXIS 6090 (Dec. 30, 1994).
{¶ 80} Finally, this issue could have been raised by Myers in his direct appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court. We note that Myers actually did allege claims of prosecutorial misconduct as part of his direct appeal under his tenth proposition of law. Res judicata applies to any issue that could have been raised on direct appeal, including a claim alleging prosecutorial misconduct. McKelton, 2015-Ohio-4228 at ¶ 23, citing State v. Zych, 12th Dist.

Palmer,,Moore,Jeffrey,,,2019,Other,Having weapons while under disability,"Possession of cocaine, trafficking of cocaine, possession of heroin",,,,17 years (eight mandatory),,2019,Other or unknown,"{¶ 24} On appeal, appellant assigns the following errors for our review:
I. The trial court erred when it permitted the state to introduce defendant/appellant’s full criminal record solely to prove defendant/appellant’s legal disability to possess firearms when defendant/appellant had offered to stipulate to the disability.
",,"{¶ 33} Nonetheless, the state argues that the admission of the evidence of appellant’s prior convictions had no impact on the outcome of the proceedings and was therefore harmless. Our determination that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting evidence of appellant’s prior convictions does not automatically result in a remand for a new trial; if the error is deemed to be harmless, the result of the trial may stand.

{¶ 41} Unlike in Creech, the evidence in this case does not conflict on a material element of the offense for which appellant was convicted. Given the overwhelming evidence of appellant’s possession of cocaine in this case and the limited extent to which the state referenced appellant’s prior convictions, we find that the trial court’s erroneous admission of appellant’s prior convictions was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.
{¶ 42} Accordingly, appellant’s first assignment of error is not well-taken.",harmless error,Gene A. Zmuda,,"Christine E. Mayle, Thomas J. Osowik",,Kevin J. Baxter,,"{¶ 25} In his first assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court erred in allowing the state to introduce evidence of, and comment upon, his prior felony convictions despite his willingness to stipulate to his firearm disability at trial.{¶ 26} A trial court is vested with broad discretion to determine the admissibility of evidence, as long as that discretion is exercised in accordance with the rules of procedure and evidence. Rigby v. Lake Cty., 58 Ohio St.3d 269, 271, 569 N.E.2d 1056 (1991). Thus, we will not disturb the trial court’s decision to admit or exclude evidence absent an abuse of discretion. An abuse of discretion connotes an attitude on the part of the court that is unreasonable, unconscionable, or arbitrary. Franklin Cty. Sheriff's Dept. v. State Emp. Relations Bd., 63 Ohio St.3d 498, 506, 589 N.E.2d 24 (1992).
{¶ 27} Here, appellant contends that the trial court should have excluded evidence of his prior convictions, which the state used to establish his firearm disability, because he offered to stipulate to said disability at the outset of the trial. In light of his proposed stipulation, appellant contends that the evidence of his prior convictions were unfairly prejudicial and inadmissible under Evid.R. 403(A).
{¶ 28} In support of his argument, appellant cites the Ohio Supreme Court’s decision in State v. Creech, 150 Ohio St.3d 540, 2016-Ohio-8440, 84 N.E.3d 981. In that case, the Ohio Supreme Court adopted the reasoning of the United States Supreme Court in Old Chief v. United States, 519 U.S. 172, 117 S.Ct. 644, 136 L.Ed.2d 574 (1997), and determined that a trial court abuses its discretion under Evid.R. 403(A) when it does not allow a defendant to stipulate to his prior convictions for the purposes of establishing the status element of the offense of having weapons while under disability, and instead permits the state to introduce the full record of the defendant’s prior offenses. Id. at ¶ 1. Moreover, the court held that the state may not reject the defendant’s stipulation in favor of presenting evidence “establishing the name and nature” of a defendant’s prior convictions. Id. at ¶ 36. The court determined that such evidence could be unfairly prejudicial where it “arouses the jury’s emotional sympathies, evokes a sense of horror, or appeals to an instinct to punish[.]” Id., citing Oberlin v. Akron Gen. Med. Ctr., 91 Ohio St.3d 169, 172, 743 N.E.2d 890 (2001).

{¶ 29} Like appellant, the defendant in Creech offered to stipulate to his firearm disabilities on the morning of trial. Id. at ¶ 8. However, the trial court refused to allow the proposed stipulation after concluding that the state was not required to prove its case by accepting the stipulation. Id. at ¶ 9. Thereafter, the state addressed the defendant’s prior convictions for felonious assault and domestic violence, as well as his pending indictment for aggravated drug trafficking, in its opening and closing statements, during trial testimony, and in exhibits published to the jury. Id. at ¶ 10. The state elicited testimony from a detective, who provided details of the defendant’s prior convictions, and introduced judgment entries that set forth some of the facts underlying the convictions, including that the defendant had shot at his victim. Id. The Ohio Supreme Court reviewed this evidence, and determined that it “‘would be arresting enough to lure a juror into a sequence of bad character reasoning,’ especially since it involved another offense with a gun.” Id. at ¶ 36, quoting Old Chief at 185. Further, the court summarily concluded that the error in admitting the evidence of the defendant’s prior convictions was not harmless.",https://www.supremecourt.ohio.gov/rod/docs/pdf/6/2021/2021-Ohio-765.pdf,"""State v.

{¶33} “IX. THE JURY FUNDAMENTALLY LOST ITS WAY IN ENTERING FINDINGS OF GUILT AGAINST THE MANIFEST WEIGHT OF THE EVIDENCE.”
",,"{¶46} Upon review of the entire record, the trial court did not abuse its discretion when finding that CS’s reporting the alleged abuse of a second boy, which Appellant is not alleged to know of or participate in, is not relevant to Appellant’s case. Appellant claims that the questioning was a challenge to C.S.’s credibility. Under Ohio Evid.R. 616(C), Appellant may show facts contradicting witness testimony; however, the fact that police could not locate the four-year-old boy does not contradict the testimony, and the trial court did not abuse its discretion precluding Appellant from questioning CS or Mongold about the alleged abuse of the neighborhood boy.
{¶47} Appellant’s First Assignment of Error is Overruled.

{¶53} We find Schnirring’s testimony not to be within the purview of Boston. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting Schnirring’s testimony.
{¶54} Appellant’s Second Assignment of Error is overruled.

{¶61} We find the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion as Appellant demonstrated no particularized need for such an expert. Appellant could not show what testimony was anticipated, only that the witness may or may not agree with Schnirring. This is insufficient to establish the trial court abused its discretion.
{¶62} Appellant’s Third Assignment of Error is overruled.

{¶70} Schnirring provided sufficient evidence to demonstrate knowledge and experience in the field sufficient to assist the finder of fact in its determination. We hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding Schnirring was qualified to serve as an expert.
{¶71} Appellant’s Fourth Assignment of Error is overruled.

{¶80} As Appellant’s trial counsel did not meet the criteria set forth under OH ST RPC Rule 1.16(a), he was not required to withdraw as counsel. Therefore, the decision not to withdraw representation would be within the counsel’s wide range of trial tactics and strategies and not ineffective assistance of counsel. Therefore, Appellant’s argument is unpersuasive and does not show counsel’s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonable representation.

In addition, the court instructed the jury that it was not required to believe the testimony of any witness, and that it could “believe or disbelieve all or any part of the testimony of any witness.” Viewing the prosecutor’s remarks in the context of the entire trial, we cannot say that the outcome of the trial was affected.

Hayden’s argument is that two prosecution witnesses presented conflicting testimony about whether sperm and seminal fluid were
found in samples taken from the victim",No error," The existence of those reports has been known for many years, and their contents have been mentioned in prior litigation. But even on the merits, we are unpersuaded by Hayden’s argument about an alleged discrepancy between the testimony of Stemple and Kiddon. The fact that Stemple testified about not finding sperm or seminal fluid fails to establish that Kiddon testified falsely when she claimed to have found such evidence. Stemple’s failure to see sperm or seminal fluid on the slide that he examined does not prove Kiddon necessarily did not see sperm or seminal fluid on the samples she reviewed

In any event, this issue could have been raised many years ago, and the trial court correctly found that res judicata precludes Hayden from pursuing it now.

Wearry at 1006.
{¶73} Hill supported his Brady claim with the Cincinnati Police Preliminary
Investigation Report and Dudley’s grand jury testimony. The police report was
wrongly withheld. Hill’s demand for discovery gave rise to a duty on the part of the
state to provide “reports from peace officers” and “evidence favorable to [Hill] and
material to [his] guilt or punishment.” Crim.R. 16(B)(5) and (B)(6). The state, in its
response to the demand, did not provide the Cincinnati Police Preliminary
Investigation Report and claimed to “know[] of no evidence favorable to the
defendant.” But the police report was from a peace officer, and it contained
favorable exculpatory and impeachment evidence.
{¶74} The report shows that behavior and statements on the part of Dudley
made the reporting officer reluctant to either eliminate Dudley or label Hill as a
suspect in Domika’s disappearance and caused the officer to believe that further
inquiry was warranted into Dudley’s parenting of Domika and into why she had run
from the police and had several times directed the police to check the alley behind
the house. The defense could have used the report in cross-examining the officer and Dudley to advance its theory of innocence, by showing that Dudley had, to an
objective observer, been as likely a suspect in Domika’s disappearance and death as Hill. And the defense could have used the report to undermine the credibility of
Dudley, the state’s key witness.
{¶75} Thus, the evidence contained in the police report offered in support of
the Brady claim was not wholly negated by the trial record. The report had been
wrongly withheld. And the evidence it contained would have constituted, and could have led to, favorable impeaching or exculpatory evidence that might reasonably be said to have affected the jury’s judgment, had it been disclosed to the defense at trial.

committed misconduct by “insinuat[ing] that the defense manufactured testimony.” We
disagree.
{¶31} During cross-examination of appellant, the prosecutor asked if appellant and Jane Doe discussed her testimony prior to trial, specifically, whether he lifted her off the ground during the altercation. Doe testified he did lift her off the ground, and appellant testified he did not.
{¶32} Appellant acknowledged he and Doe spoke of the incident that day but
denied they discussed her testimony in advance. The following statements were then made:
 * * * *.
 PROSECUTOR: But you just said that you asked her if she
thought…if she thought you lifted her up off the ground on your drive
back?
 APPELLANT: I did ask her that.
 PROSECUTOR: Okay did you both meet with your attorney?
 APPELLANT: Yesterday.
 PROSECUTOR: Now when she got out of the car and she
came around your testimony is that you weren’t screaming at her?
 APPELLANT: Absolutely not.
 * * * *.
 T. 180. 
{¶33} Appellant argues that in this exchange, the prosecutor suggested that appellant and Doe met with defense counsel and manufactured testimony. Brief, 16. Appellant did not object to the question. ",No error,"{¶38} In the instant case, we disagree with appellant’s characterization of the record; the single question whether appellant and Doe met with his attorney did not create in the jury a belief that appellant and defense counsel “manufactured testimony.” Appellant points to no such explicit suggestion in the record. Moreover, it would not make sense for appellee to insinuate the parties manufactured testimony when in fact they testified differently about whether appellant lifted Doe off the ground.
{¶39} Finally, appellant cannot demonstrate, even if the cited question was improper, “but for” the question he would not have been convicted. Appellee presented compelling evidence, including the testimony of a law enforcement officer on the scene who witnessed the incident from its inception. Having failed to demonstrate a causal connection between the alleged misconduct and his resulting convictions, appellant cannot demonstrate reversible error. See, State v. Montgomery, 5th Dist.

Smoot,,2019,Other,Criminal damaging,,,,,90 days,,2019,"Summation,Examination of witnesses","{¶ 27} In his second assignment of error, Smoot argues that the trial court
committed plain error by allowing the state to violate his Fifth-Amendment right to remain silent. He identifies two purported violations. The first occurred when Officer Grames testified that he asked Smoot to come to the station to talk to him, but Smoot hung up on him. The second occurred at closing, when the state commented that “[t]he Defendant put on no evidence to deny any of this. Nothing. Mr. Smoot * * * had an opportunity to put that on. He didn’t do that. Why? Because he told the officer he did it.” 
",Harmless error,"{¶ 29} With respect to the state’s statement at closing that Smoot put on no evidence denying the state’s version of the events, “[i]t is well settled that the prosecution may comment upon the evidence and upon the failure of the defense to offer evidence in support of its case.”. That is all the state did here. Accordingly, we find no error arising from the state’s comment during closing argument. 

{¶ 30} Turning to Officer Grames’s testimony, the state elicited the following testimony from Officer Grames [...] {¶ 32} The state maintains that (1) any statements about Smoot hanging up when
asked to come to the station were made in the context of describing the course of the investigation; (2) the statement was elicited for no other purpose than to verify that it was Smoot who had spoken with Officer Grames on the phone; and (3) the statements and testimony—to which Smoot did not object—did not rise to the level of plain error. 

{¶ 33} Certainly, it may be error to admit evidence of a defendant’s pre-arrest silence as evidence of guilt.

{¶ 42} The present case is distinguishable from Gallup, 267 P.3d 289. For one, Smoot did not remain silent—he admitted spray-painting the doors. He hung up only after making this admission. Additionally, the state did not argue that Smoot’s decision to hang up on Officer Grames was substantive evidence of his guilt or offer additional commentary about Smoot hanging up on Officer Grames. 

We find here that the reference to Smoot hanging up on Officer
Grames was an isolated comment with no suggestion to the jury that guilt be inferred.
Under the circumstances of this case, any arguable error in Officer Grames testifying that Smoot hung up on him was harmless.
{¶ 44} We find Smoot’s second assignment of error not well-taken. ",harmless error,Christine E. Mayle,Christine E. Mayle,Mark L. Pietrykowski and Thomas J. Osowik,"Mark L. Pietrykowski,Thomas J.

Horsley, Jon Vogt",William T. Horsley,Warren,Zidkijah,Zidkijah Warren,Black,2018,Other,Criminal damaging,,,,,,,2018,Other or unknown,"{¶16} In his sole assignment of error, Warren argues that the trial court
erred by relying on the statements of the prosecutor as evidence in reaching its verdict. Because the statements were inadmissible hearsay, we review for harmless error. See State v. Sorrels, 71 Ohio App.3d 162, 165, 593 N.E.2d 313 (1st Dist.1991). An error is harmless when “there is no reasonable possibility that the evidence may have contributed to the defendant’s conviction. If the trier of fact, whether it be a jury or a trial judge, expressly relies upon hearsay statements in determining guilt, the admission of the hearsay is prejudicial.” Id. 
",Harmful error,"{¶19} In this case, the trial court did not exclude any testimony proposed by
the state. The state did not seek to present any testimony regarding the allegation that the nurse who created the medical records was fired due to an improper romantic relationship with Warren. Rather, the state presented arguments as to why the documents were inadmissible. Thus the statements were not an offer of evidence, and it was error for the court to consider and rely on the hearsay arguments of the prosecutor as admissible evidence. 

{¶21} In reaching its verdict, the trial court expressly relied upon the
prosecutor’s admissibility argument to discount the medical records. The court’s statement shows a reasonable possibility that the prosecutor’s argument may have contributed to the conviction. See id. Because the trial court expressly relied on the prosecutor’s statements, the conviction must be reversed. See Sorrells, 71 Ohio App. 3d at 165, 593 N.E.2d 313. Accordingly, we sustain the assignment of error. ",harmless error,zayas,Marilyn Zayas,Bergeron and Crouse,"Pierre H. Bergeron,Candace C.

The appellant, Zidkijah Warren, was already incarcerated at Hamilton County Justice Center and was charged with criminal damaging for banging his head against the cell-door window and cracking the glass. This specific appeal is against the trial court — which erred by relying on the prosecutor's statement as admissible evidence when it simply hearsay arguments. The prosecutor stated that ""based on his conversations with “the officers involved,” the nurse who made the statements in the records had been “let go” from the Justice Center. He also stated that “it appeared she had a relationship with one of the inmates there, and it would appear that that inmate is the defendant."" (page 4). The court specifically said that it relied on this statement: ""the trial court stated, “based on the allegation by the prosecutor that there was an intimate relationship with the medical personnel, it kind of taints the medical report.

See App.R. 16(A)(7). We will therefore limit our analysis to addressing the first two remarks. ",No error,"{¶30} We conclude that the prosecutor’s rebuttal remarks in this particular case, when considered within the context of the entire trial, were not improper, but were instead made in fair response to defense counsel’s closing argument, and Mr. Puryear’s constitutional rights were
therefore not violated. See Robinson, 485 U.S. at 32.
{¶31} Even assuming arguendo that the prosecutor’s remarks were improper, we would nonetheless determine that they did not prejudicially affect Mr. Puryear’s substantial rights. A
review of the record shows that these statements “did not permeate the state’s argument” so as to
deny Mr. Puryear a fair trial. See Adams, 2017-Ohio-1178, at ¶ 33, citing State v. Treesh, 90 Ohio St.3d 460, 468 (2001). Mr. Puryear has also failed to show that but for those comments,
the outcome of his trial would have been different. See id. “We recognize that ‘it is not enough that there be sufficient other evidence to sustain a conviction in order to excuse [a prosecutor’s]
improper remarks. Instead, it must be clear beyond a reasonable doubt that, absent the prosecutor’s comments, the jury would have found defendant guilty.’” State v. Kirby, 9th Dist.
Summit No. 23814, 2008-Ohio-3107, ¶ 31, quoting Smith, 14 Ohio St.3d at 15. The State introduced overwhelming evidence against Mr. Puryear at trial, including Trooper VanDyke’s
testimony and the dash cam video of the incident, and we conclude that it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury would have found him guilty of OVI even without the alleged improper comments.

{¶70} During cross-examination, and over the objections of the Helfrich, the state attempted to question Helfrich as having been found to be a vexatious litigator. 2T. at 258-262. The state cross-examined Helfrich with a 2012 Opinion of this Court affirming
the trial court’s decision finding him to be a vexatious litigator in an unrelated civil case. Helfrich v. Madison, 5th Dist. Licking No. 11 CA 26, 2012-Ohio-551. Initially, the Judge sustained the objection however, he then allowed the prosecutor to question him.

{¶71} The state repeated that Helfrich had been designated a vexatious litigator as a part of her closing arguments, claiming that he had been named a vexatious litigator due to retaliatory conduct and intimidation of witnesses and that showed his character in the present case",Harmless error,"{¶78} We find the state’s questioning and use of the vexatious litigator evidence to have been improper insofar as Helfrich was not found to be a vexatious litigator because he used retaliation and intimidation against individuals with whom he disagreed.
The state further improperly used this evidence to argue that Helfrich’s actions in this case were in conformity with his past actions in contravention of Evid.R. 404(B). 


{¶81} In the case at bar, we find beyond a reasonable doubt, that evidence of Helfrich’s vexatious litigator status did not contribute to his conviction. As noted in our disposition of Helfrich’s Second and Twelfth Assignments of Error sufficient evidence was presented to support each element of the crime of theft. The jury was able to personally observe Helfrich, Kaiser and Officer Wisniewski subject to cross-examination. The jury was able to view real-time videos of the events.

Caldwell's counsel did object, and the trial court instructed the jury to disregard. Furthermore, the video, the 911 calls, and the testimonial evidence overwhelmingly established Caldwell's identity and guilt. Thus, even with the inappropriate comments, the jury still saw Caldwell attack S.S. with their own eyes via the video. The jury still heard five separate people call 911 about the attacks.

sanction, a trial court must consider “(1) whether the failure to disclose was a willful violation of Crim.R. 16, (2) whether foreknowledge of the undisclosed material would have benefited the accused in the preparation of a defense, and (3) whether the accused was prejudiced.”

{¶12} In this case, the trial court failed to make any inquiry into the
circumstances of the discovery violation. 

{¶13} Due to the trial court’s failure to inquire into the circumstances of the violation, it was impossible to determine an appropriate sanction. First, the record does not provide any justification or excuse for the state’s failure to comply with the discovery request

Officer Contris testified that he photographed Smith’s injuries on the night of the alleged assault. According to Contris, “I had [Smith] fill out a statement and took
pictures. * * * And then I went down to the clerk’s office to file a domestic violence form.” Thus, the state should have known about the photographs well in advance of
trial. In the exercise of due diligence, the state should have asked Contris if he took any photographs of the alleged victim’s injuries when it received Hall’s discovery demand
Because the court did not inquire into the circumstances of the discovery violation, we are unable to determine whether the state acted willfully or negligently in failing to disclose the photographs. 

{¶15} Finally, the record demonstrates that the photographs had a significant impact on Hall’s case. Because it
imposed a sanction without engaging in the sound reasoning process provided by Darmond, we find that the trial court abused its discretion

{¶17} Based on the foregoing analysis, we sustain Hall’s second assignment of error. Because our determination of Hall’s second assignment of error necessitates reversal of the trial court’s judgment and a remand of the cause to the trial court",Crim.R. 16,Crouse,Candace C.

Garth","Chris Brown,Andrew W. Garth",Covington,D'Andre,D’Andre Covington,Black,2019,Other,Falsification and failure to disclose personal information,,,,,n/a,,2019,Discovery,"{¶17} In his second assignment of error, Covington argues that the trial court erred by denying his right to discovery. He contends that the trial court should have dismissed the charges against him when the state failed to disclose evidence, specifically the dash-cam footage that he had requested. 

------


{¶24} In his third assignment of error, Covington broadly asserts that “the
trial court erred by denying appellant’s motions to dismiss for failure to prosecute, failure to provide bill of particulars, prosecutor misconduct, judicial misconduct and cruel and unusual punishment by selectively prosecuting with prejudice and discrimination.”",No error,"{¶22} Following our review of the record, we find no abuse of discretion on the part of the trial court in its handling of the discovery issues. It was reasonable for the trial court to extend the time for the state to produce the requested video evidence until July 3. 
When extending the time for the state to produce the video evidence, the court recognized that the city was inundated with requests for body-worn camera evidence and explained that because the city lacked enough employees to process those requests, the court granted latitude to the city regarding the production of that information. It was also reasonable for the trial court to order the state to inquire further into the existence of the dash-cam video. The trial court informed Covington that he had the right to file an additional motion regarding the dash-cam video if the parties learned that the video existed but the state had failed to produce it, or if it once existed and had since been destroyed. 
Covington failed to file any additional motions regarding discovery, such as a motion for sanctions for failure to produce evidence, the destruction of evidence, or the failure to maintain evidence.
{¶23} There was nothing arbitrary, unreasonable, or unconscionable in the
trial court’s handling of the discovery issues. The second assignment of error is accordingly overruled.","Crim.R. 16,prosecutor misconduct","MYERS, JUDGE",Beth A. Myers,"ZAYAS, P.J.

{¶12} Duncan identifies the following exchange between the prosecutor and Detective Geiger as the basis of his first assignment of error:
[Prosecutor]: And in your experience with the Sheriff’s Office,
have you responded to a number of assaults or domestic
violences?  ....

Tr. 338-340. Duncan argues that Detective Geiger, as a lay witness, gave an opinion regarding the progression of bruising in the absence of “specialized knowledge, skill, experience, or training” in this area",Did not reach error/conduct did not result in prejudice,"However, in this case, we do not ultimately need to decide whether the trial court erred in allowing Detective Geiger to offer this opinion because, even if this testimony had been erroneously admitted, this would constitute harmless error.

Duncan has not demonstrated how the admission of Detective Geiger’s opinion testimony unfairly prejudiced him or affected his substantial rights. While we need not and do not reach a conclusion as to whether the trial court erred in permitting this opinion evidence, we do find that, even if this testimony was improperly admitted, this error was harmless. See Crim.R. 52(A). Thus, Duncan’s first assignment of error is overruled. ",harmless error,WILLAMOWSKI,John R. Willamowski,PRESTON and ZIMMERMAN,"Vernon L. Preston,William R. Zimmerman",Jana E.

erred in allowing the state to present rebuttal witness testimony from Sgt. Johnson about appellant making a statement that the marijuana in the laundry basket was hers. Defense counsel objected to the rebuttal witness and argued that the prosecution was attempting “to patch up a hole in their case” since there had been no testimony as to whether appellant admitted that the marijuana was hers.
The record reflects that on cross-examination, appellant’s mother was
asked: “Did you hear your daughter tell the officers that the marijuana from the laundry basket was hers?” Appellant’s mother responded, “No.” She also denied that any of the marijuana found in the house was hers",,"The state argues that Sgt. Johnson’s rebuttal testimony related to the
credibility of the defense witness. The state further claims that even if the admission of the rebuttal testimony was error, any error was harmless.

The remaining evidence admitted at trial established appellant’s constructive possession of the drugs, as well as her guilt beyond any reasonable doubt of each of the crimes. ",,SEAN C.

THE TRIAL COURT SHOULD HAVE DISCHARGED THACKER FROM
PROSECUTION, BECAUSE THE STATE VIOLATED HIS STATUTORY AND
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO A SPEEDY TRIAL.”",Harmful error,"{¶16} We are not persuaded by the state’s contention that Thacker’s failure to respond to its discovery request kept the speedy trial clock from ticking. First, the request was made in November, 2016. There is no indication whatsoever in this record that the state was delayed in its preparation for trial by Thacker’s failure to respond to its request for discovery. What is evident in the record is that the delay of 437 days is nearly five times the 90-day period set forth in R.C. 2945.71(B)(2) in which to bring Thacker’s case to trial. To hold that 437 days count against Thacker where there is no indication in the record that the state was delayed in its trial preparations by Thacker’s lack of response, would be an injustice and not in keeping with the purposes of either speedy trial rights or discovery. Cf. In re D.S., 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 97757, 2012-Ohio-2213, ¶36.

We therefore hold that because there was no time waiver by Thacker or his
attorney, or a judgment entry setting forth the necessity and reasonableness of the
continuance filed before the expiration of the statutory time period prescribed by R.C.
2945.71 for bringing Thacker to trial, the decision of the trial court overruling Thacker’s
Motion to Dismiss is reversed.

The judgment of the Muskingum County Court is reversed. Pursuant to
Section 3(B) (2), Article IV of the Ohio Constitution, Thacker’s convictions and sentences
in this case are vacated, and the case is remanded to the trial court to enter the appropriate dismissal entries.",,"Gwin, P.J.,",W. Scott Gwin,"Delaney, J., and

prosecutorial misconduct.
They contend they were unable to defend the charges
because the state intentionally denied them prompt access to the seized cats, and
because the condition of the animals was in flux, prompt access was critical to defending
the charges.

{¶13} The Due Process Clause affords an accused a meaningful opportunity to
present a complete defense, including the preservation of and access to exculpatory
evidence. California v. Trombetta, 467 U.S. 479, 485, 104 S.Ct. 2528, 81 L.Ed.2d 413
(1984). As argued, the Due Process Clause protects a criminal defendant from being
convicted where the state fails to preserve materially exculpatory evidence or in bad faith
destroys potentially useful evidence. Id.

{¶15} “The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, as interpreted
in Brady, makes the good or bad faith of the State irrelevant when the State fails to
disclose to the defendant material exculpatory evidence.”",No error,"(29) Accordingly, appellants fail to show they were ever denied the opportunity
to have the cats examined. Appellants likewise fail to show the state acted in bad faith in denying their request to visit the animals or in destroying evidence. Further, they do not claim that the state acted in bad faith by providing the animals the necessary nutrition and medical attention or that this constitutes anything other than “normal procedures” after animals are seized in connection with animal abuse charges.


(31) Here, as in Jones, there was ample evidence of the animals’ conditions at
the time they were seized based on the veterinarian records as well photographs of each cat. Thus, appellants’ first assigned error lacks merit and is overruled.",,THOMAS R. WRIGHT,Thomas R.

{¶22} Appellant states that “[t]he crux of [her] appeal is centered upon the allowance of the testimony of Detective Dennis Bort and Officer Richard Butler, who provided hearsay testimony of the victim identifying [appellant] as the assaulter.”


{¶24} The record also reflects several instances where objections were not raised to testimony that was elicited concerning the victim’s statements, including during the testimony of  Detective Bort. Appellant maintains that it was plain error to allow the testimony of Detective
Bort, made without objection, because it affected her substantial rights since the testimony violated appellant’s right to confront the witnesses",Did not reach error/conduct did not result in prejudice,"{¶31} Not only was the challenged testimony of Detective Bort and Officer Butler hearsay, but also, because it was testimonial hearsay, it implicates the Confrontation Clause.

Confrontation Clause violation was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.",harmless error,,,,,,,,https://www.supremecourt.ohio.gov/rod/docs/pdf/8/2018/2018-Ohio-2841.pdf,2018-Ohio-2841_JM_DNMS.pdf (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/38/38/1740009600000/OxVagbbkHmF3oPj6fjNIUw/0TvGS7DsY5Q8u3-VDSCDNzp003VgHSaVJ1RIcH3-mm1qJoM2KpMjcb0SbigdYkMFl0q0tpFnGd5T3nAbVxc4uWBbqOcEs3v7sMOnUJhuSr-nyD3sefmZ0x804T0Kgn-aFhOdfzZ4YaYfWgKOpvmLhZz9SFhzVDnDN6imVYMz0qM/oCbsM1QE8sakdp85Yv7YrYVY8b-51Thskf7YrgntnDI),,,,,,Jake Millman,Patricia Martinez Sastre,,,,,,Jake Millman,,,CR-17-613189-A,,,,checked,,,106194,,,,,,,,,,,,2018-Ohio-2841,,,,,,,

night some more than four years earlier, when she was 12 years old, Hartman entered her room three different times on one evening and, while she pretended to be asleep, touched her chest,
attempted to touch her vagina, and put her hand on his penis. Hartman argues that the testimony violated Evid.R. 404(B) because it was dissimilar to the acts alleged in this case and offered only to show that he had the propensity to commit rape. 

{¶40} The problem with the state’s use of the other acts evidence to prove identity is that Hartman’s identity was never at issue; he conceded engaging in sexual conduct with the victim.
The primary issue at trial was consent — Hartman maintained that he and the victim engaged in consensual sexual conduct [...] Evidence that Hartman sexually assaulted his stepdaughter had no relevance to the one fact of consequence — whether the victim consented. 

----------
{¶50} The frequency with which flight instructions issues are being raised on appeal is troubling. Although a number of recent decisions from this court have made it clear that the flight instruction is often being wrongly given, the state keeps requesting it in cases where the instruction is unwarranted. And even though the instructions are requested by prosecuting
attorneys, the error lies with the trial court continuing to give the flight instruction without regard to our established precedent.",Harmful error,"{¶43} Finally, the admitted evidence was highly prejudicial to Hartman. Although the court instructed the jury on other acts evidence immediately before and after the stepdaughter testified, that instruction was insufficient to cure the error in admitting the evidence. Even
though the state offered the evidence to prove identity, the court’s instruction was not tailored to  that purpose. 
 The instruction thus allowed the jury to consider the evidence for purposes that even the state did not claim existed in this case.

Appellant argues that the testimony about the recovered firearm, and its admission, was irrelevant and prejudicial. ",Harmless error,"{¶ 52} Based on our review, we find that even if the trial court did not abuse its discretion by relying on the representations of the state in its initial evidentiary ruling, once the detective provided no evidence that he saw appellant possess or discard the gun, and there was no DNA evidence linking him to the gun, the prejudicial value of this evidence
substantially outweighed its probative value. There was nothing to link this firearm to appellant. The detective admitted that he did not know if the gun had ""something to do with the case or not."" (Tr. at 650.) As such, the evidence should have been excluded.

TRIAL COUNSEL, THE USE OF AN INCIDENT REPORT TO “REFRESH
THE RECOLLECTION” OF A WITNESS WHO DID NOT CREATE THE
INCIDENT REPORT. 

{¶24} From what we can determine from the record, Officer Donohue utilized an incident report during several questions and Dennis objected during several of those questions.
First, Officer Donohue was asked the time of the incident. Officer Donohue responded that he could not say for sure without seeing the report. The prosecutor asked if seeing the report would
refresh Officer Donohue’s recollection and he responded affirmatively. The prosecutor then handed Officer Donohue the report and asked him to look at it and let the prosecutor know when his recollection was refreshed. Officer Donohue then provided the time of the incident",Harmless error,"{¶28} It appears that, despite the State’s argument to the contrary, at least some of Officer Donohue’s testimony was not permitted under Evid.R. 612. Officer Donohue read the serial number of the gun, Dennis’ date of birth, and, it appears, his social security number

Moreover, during Dennis’ police interview, he acknowledged that the gun and drugs were his and admitted to having a
prior conviction for aggravated robbery. Given the foregoing, we can only conclude that any error in the admission of the challenged testimony was harmless.

Miller was a gaming agent for the Ohio Casino Control Commission stationed at the Hollywood Columbus Casino in 2014. Miller testified that on March 10, 2014, he was alerted to an attempt by Bridges to slide dice on a craps table at that casino. Miller described a single roll wherein Bridges placed a bet for two “3s” to come up and successfully spun the dice to produce two “3s.” The dealer called a “no roll” because the dice failed to touch the wall of the craps table. Miller testified that Bridges left the casino shortly thereafter.",No error,"{¶29} We find no error in this instance. The state introduced Miller’s testimony
to establish Bridges’ familiarity with the rules of the game of craps including the restriction against dice sliding as well as to establish absence of mistake in Bridges’ conduct at the table. Miller’s testimony was relevant and presented for a legitimate purpose under Evid.R. 404(B).

{¶30} Arguably Miller’s testimony was superfluous because, as the Supreme Court of Nevada explained in Skipper, the surreptitious manipulation of the dice to remove the element of chance from the game of craps would be a patently identifiable act of cheating to any person of reasonable intelligence contemplating such action. However, even if the record could be construed to constitute a violation of Evid.R. 404(B) we find any error in the admission of Miller’s testimony to be harmless pursuant to Crim.R. 52(A). State v.

During the federal habeas proceedings, the state produced material that appellant claims was not made available prior to or during trial. He argues this evidence would have made a difference at trial and requires the court to vacate his convictions and sentence and retry him. Specifically, appellant identifies ten items he claims the state improperly withheld. ",No error,"¶62} Considering this evidence as a whole does not lead this court to the
conclusion that there is a reasonable probability of a different result. The evidence does not undermine the confidence in the outcome of the trial given the nature of the evidence that is alleged to constitute Brady violations and the other evidence adduced at trial. ",,FRANK D. CELEBREZZE JR,,"Keough, P.J
Kilbane, J.",,Michael C. O’Malley,,"There are so many different claims of brady violations, here are some w/ their respective reasoning held by court as to why they're not brady violations. 

{¶35} In the first police report documenting Willis’s contact with police, he
relayed that Sowell was the person that shot Peter and that appellant and Reginald Germany were also involved. A second supplemental police report documented Willis’s initial phone contact with police and contained materially the same statement. Willis’s written statement also indicates that police asked Willis to identify Peter’s vehicle prior to giving a written statement. Appellant claims this is all information that could have been used to impeach Willis’s testimony. Appellant further claims that the fact that Willis identified Sowell as the shooter and appellant and Germany were involved constitutes a  Brady violation. 

{¶37} According to the trial prosecutor’s testimony in the federal proceedings, he met with Willis within one month of trial to discuss his trial testimony. Appellant argues the notes from this meeting indicate that, for the first time, Willis remembered that appellant stated, “I shot because you [meaning Sowell] shot.” No prior statement contains this line Willis claimed was uttered by appellant when appellant, Sowell, and Willis were discussing the murder shortly after it happened. Appellant argues the changing nature of Willis’s story as trial approached means this is relevant impeachment evidence that should have been disclosed prior to trial. Appellant also argues that the trial prosecutor made note of Willis’s pending burglary case. Appellant asserts these notes should also have been disclosed because they could be used to infer that an undisclosed deal had been struck between Willis and the state.


{¶42} At the hearing below, appellant’s attorney similarly admitted that he was
aware of the reward, and used that argument at trial to sow doubt in the minds of the jury about Willis’s motives. Trial counsel cross-examined Willis extensively about his motives for testifying, including the reward. Further, there are no notes of this meeting. During the hearing below, Anthony Sanelli testified that Willis just came in to tell them he had contacted police and given them the information he had relayed to the family the day before. While a police report documented that Willis stopped by the store while an
officer happened to be there, the report does not disclose anything of substance. The failure to disclose this encounter or the police report does not constitute a Brady violation.  At trial, Anthony Sanelli did testify that he did not see Willis again until months after the original meeting, so this could have been used to impeach that statement. However, the fact that Willis stopped into the store the next day for a brief visit to inform the family that he had indeed contacted police is not a material omission that prejudiced appellant.  

{¶44} Appellant argues that the witness to the crash gave a description of the
driver that matched Sowell, rather than appellant. Appellant argues this indicates that it was Sowell, rather than appellant, who shot Peter. Appellant also argues that the individual seen moving the car could have returned to the vehicle to retrieve evidence rather than being an individual who happened upon an abandoned vehicle.

{¶45} This evidence is not exculpatory or readily used for impeachment. Willis
testified that appellant told him that Sowell crashed the car into a pole. So that
information was adduced at trial. Further, simply because Sowell was driving the car does not conflict with the evidence adduced or the state’s theory of the case. Appellant claims that it only makes sense that if Sowell was seen driving the car, he must have been the person on the driver’s side of the vehicle when the car was stolen. Therefore, he must have been the one who actually killed Peter. The fact that Sowell was driving the car does not lead to the conclusion that Sowell was the person that killed Peter. This post hoc argument does not cast doubt on appellant’s conviction. It is also possible that
Sowell wanted to drive the car and appellant let him, or that as appellant was pulling Peter from the vehicle after shooting and searching him, Sowell came around to the driver’s side of the car and got in so the two could make a quick escape. 

{¶56} Appellant claims the state withheld evidence that indicated Willis was lying or that his story changed over time. {¶59} Appellant claims the state should have known Willis’s testimony was fabricated because the recreation center was closed that day. During the federal proceedings, appellant introduced testimony from a city of Cleveland employee that on the day Willis testified he saw appellant and Sowell in the car, the recreation center was
actually closed because it was Martin Luther King, Jr., Day. However, Willis testified there was a big festival or a talent show or something. This does not indicate that the state knew Willis’s testimony constituted perjury.
{¶60} Also, the fact that Willis’s testimony differed somewhat from his previous statements to police does not indicate the state knew or should have known that Willis’s testimony was untrue. Willis’s testimony was substantially similar to his prior statements. This does not amount to a Brady violation. 

{¶62} Considering this evidence as a whole does not lead this court to the
conclusion that there is a reasonable probability of a different result. The evidence does not undermine the confidence in the outcome of the trial given the nature of the evidence that is alleged to constitute Brady violations and the other evidence adduced at trial.

{¶23} In the case at bar, the state did not submit evidence of Price’s prior
conviction to show Price acted in conformity with his prior behavior. Rather, the evidence was inadvertently referred to by Alisha Kessler who testified “I just knew he [Price] had been to prison before.”

{¶24} Further, Gus Price testified Price “uh, yeah he would like yell at people, annoy people and then sometimes he would get violent.” (T. at 101). Alisha Kessler testified that, again upon direct examination by the state, “Yeah, cause sometimes when he gets, when he’s drinking he just, he’s not in the right state of mind really. (T. at 137).

{¶25} No evidence as to the charges or circumstances were elicited. The
testimony was in response to the state’s question addressing why Alisha and Gus did not confront Price when each witnessed him saw him engaged in oral sex with L.R. ",,{¶38} We find this testimony to be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. There is no reasonable possibility that the testimony contributed to Price’s conviction. The testimony was not unfairly prejudicial. ,harmless error,,,,,,,,https://www.supremecourt.ohio.gov/rod/docs/pdf/5/2018/2018-Ohio-1988.pdf,2018-Ohio-1988_JM_DNMS.pdf (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/38/38/1740009600000/Upy7Re-WAhwjNkDvhCMMVQ/UBXWMflYnwGWzQ1c0eDnd2-wU-_faHd7hYbGJxt1nz9JXIbcElwDZ5aT_BqJV1NS7FsybFgm3XLiZXzEvVhYCA_eUiCZP6IO0z4i_dAKWmpuP64PpbTb31B84G-TMOLPcRBri_gQxpdfOuP3F1usdTpZLV_qNMMPbDKYoBhZhEk/KxzQq72_sifcpURtgkKf-jNO31Xyp3BZ7Ttx6G395fU),,,,,,Jake Millman,Cameron Oakes,,,,,,Jake Millman,CJI,,16CR077,CO - Discussed with Jake K. and we agree it leans more towards DNMS.,,,checked,No allegation of prosecutor misconduct,,17CA015,,,,,,,,,,,,2018-Ohio-1988,,,,,,,

{¶ 35} In his fourth assignment of error, Marcum argues that that the court erred in allowing several state's witnesses to testify to prior bad acts in contravention of Evid.R. 404(B). Specifically, Marcum points to testimony from his stepdaughter, Kenetta Lawson,
and his sister-in-law, Millie Manns, alleging that he stole cash from his wife and testimony from Detective Rawlins that the detective was familiar with Marcum because of another investigation",Harmless error,"¶ 39} This court concludes that the challenged testimony was improper. The testimony was irrelevant to the determination of the relevant issues, i.e., whether Marcum committed the robberies at Discount Tobacco and Walgreens. Otherwise, the evidence was only useful to show Marcum's propensity for committing theft crimes or being a criminal. As
such, there was a danger of unfair prejudice resulting from the admission of the improper evidence.
{¶ 40} Nonetheless, this court does not find that the error rose to the level of plain error. The testimony was brief in the context of the three-day trial. Neither party focused on the testimony, which was primarily contextual [...] After thoroughly reviewing the record, this
court is not concerned that the challenged testimony affected the outcome of the case.
Accordingly, this court overrules Marcum's fourth assignment of error",harmless error,,,,,,,,https://www.supremecourt.ohio.gov/rod/docs/pdf/12/2018/2018-Ohio-1009.pdf,2018-Ohio-1009_JM_DNMS.pdf (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/38/38/1740009600000/dfFlmIfzOTsRJV1KEtVVFg/8501msp2ugjQasKXU76bXQGduRk_0_cQLy67VlkkX-zVEvDhRwQuQm6yaIu9S-GNz_tvxufYeuyeWI865aFezGtiIG-VUZnReOvPNrISA9mPmMTUoc-Zz9nzvv4a6EYr7OajKhLwz079tRrXPm9gwVtUxHV1FjUzk5JK-_jtYWU/BDFavTcEG3QgapRG3V4I5eIZERudCYTpgSg7bf3HrkM),,,,,,Jake Millman,Cameron Oakes,,,,,,Jake Millman,CJI,,,CO - conferred with Jake and we agree this case does not meet standards.,,,checked,"""Allegation of error is against the court, not the prosecutor/state""",,CA2017-05-057,,,,,,,,,,,,2018-Ohio-1009,,,,,,,

Specifically, he contends that the evidence obtained from the controlled buys should have been suppressed because the State failed to satisfy its burden of establishing that an exception to the warrant requirement applied to the controlled buys that allegedly occurred inside his home. ",Did not reach error/conduct did not result in prejudice,"{¶ 19} Furthermore, even if we were to assume that the controlled buys did occur in Powell’s home, by the very nature of the transaction the trial court could reasonably conclude, as it did, that any entry of the confidential informants into the home was with Powell’s consent. On twelve occasions the confidential informants, under the direction of law enforcement, met with
Powell, and each time the confidential informants returned with illegal drugs. Needless to say, competent and credible evidence presented at the suppression hearing supports the trial court’s conclusion that Powell was a willing participant in the transaction, and that any presence of the
confidential informants in his home was with his knowledge and consent. Thus, an illegal search did not occur and the State was not required to have a search warrant.

 In his second assignment of error, appellant argues the trial court erred in permitting the state to call a defense-retained consulting expert when the expert's testimony was needlessly cumulative pursuant to Evid.R. 403(B). We agree with both arguments, but under the facts of this case, find the errors harmless. ",Harmless error,"{¶ 24} We find the trial court's decision compelling the defense to disclose a letter from a consulting expert was error.

MICHAEL HADDOX,Dennis Michael Haddox,"{¶ 21} The state argues that appellant’s first attorney requested supplemental discovery from the state specifically for the purpose of providing the same to Kessis sothat he could write a report. The state further argues appellant’s first attorney advised the state of a document composed by Kessis detailing his review and analysis of the BCI’s procedures and methods. None of this, however, changes the fact that Kessis' report to defense counsel was not discoverable if the counsel representing appellant at trial had no intention to call Kessis as a witness. Whatever strategy appellant’s first attorney had in mind had no bearing on the trial strategy of appellant’s second attorney.  

{¶ 24} We find the trial court's decision compelling the defense to disclose a letter from a consulting expert was error. We further find that permitting the state to call a defense-retained DNA expert to present evidence cumulative to its own DNA expert was error. We find, however, based on the evidence in this matter that these errors were harmless. 

{¶ 29} The forensic evidence in this case is strong, and the victim was able to provide the jury with a detailed account of the rape. After a thorough review of the record, we find the remaining properly introduced evidence overwhelmingly establishes defendant's guilt.

Hupp, 3d Dist. Allen No. 1-08-21, 2009-Ohio1912, ¶ 20; see also Lawson, supra, at ¶ 23 (even if forensic interviewer’s testimony was improper credibility vouching, it did not affect the outcome of trial because the victims testified and were subject to cross examination). Therefore, because J.S. testified and was subject to cross-examination, even if it was error to allow Colliers to testify that J.S.’s statements were
“consistent with a sexual assault”, such error was harmless. 

{¶58} Based on the foregoing, Blanton’s third assignment of error is overruled. ",,Marie Hoover,,"McFarland, J.

{¶44} At trial, the State presented the testimony of Tracy Colliers, a social worker at the Mayerson Center at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital. Colliers testified that she interviewed J.S. on February 24, 2016, to inquire about allegations J.S. had made regarding her interaction with Blanton. In fact, a recording of the interview was played at trial and admitted as an exhibit. Over
Blanton’s objection, Colliers testified that J.S.’s statements during the interview “were consistent with a sexual assault.”

{¶45} Blanton provides several arguments in support of his assertion that Colliers’s opinion testimony should have been excluded at trial.

{¶46} First, Blanton argues that the State failed to properly lay a foundation under Evid.R. 702 for admitting Colliers’s testimony that J.S.’s statements made during the forensic interview were consistent with being sexually assaulted.

{¶51} Next, Blanton contends that Colliers lacked the requisite qualifications under Evid.R. 702(B) to render an opinion.

{¶52} A review of the transcript reveals that Colliers is a licensed social worker at the Mayerson Center, where she regularly conducts forensic interviews of children victimized by sex crimes. She has been employed in this capacity since 2005 – specifically at the Mayerson Center since 2012 – and has a Master’s Degree in social work from the University of Cincinnati. She estimated that, since 2005, she has conducted over 1,000 interviews of sexually-victimized children. Moreover, prior to Blanton’s trial, Colliers had testified as an expert witness in Ohio on two other occasions. Given this record of specialized training and professional experience, we conclude that Colliers did not lack the requisite qualifications under Evid.R. 702(B) to render an expert opinion...
