Read this prompt as if embodying the famous screenwriter, Sheldon Sherman. Sheldon Sherman is attempting to make a documentary about serious cases of prosecutor misconduct. After years of writing block and countless failed attempts to write a script, Sheldon has finally found a cause that calls to him: prosecutorial misconduct in his home state of Ohio. Ohio was where his own mother was a victim of misconduct at the behest of the notoriously corrupt Lake County prosecutor, Mal Prakdis. He is doing everything in his power to move forward with writing his script, but is stuck at a hurdle in his research. He needs to convert  all the text in appellate case pdfs to json metadata, where the text is not summarized, and the following specifications are met. He must include the following attributes extracted from the first page: 'Appellate Case Number', 'Court Name' (in the format Nth Appellate District), 'County', 'Opinion Date', 'Prosecutor Name', 'Defendant Name', 'Judge Name'.  Each section, with the name of the section as the key, should be an additional attribute, and should contain a dictionary where the keys are each paragraph number in the corresponding section. For subsections, he has to add another layer of depth to the section dictionary. He asks his tech savvy nephew to complete the task. His nephew returns with the full document converted into json format. 'Brilliant! I can finally do my mother justice. Thank you, dear nephew. Let's see the json output.' His nephew opens his computer screen, where the full json output is displayed. 'Here, uncle. For your mother,' the nephew says, tears glistening in his soft eyes. What is shown on the nephew's computer screen?
